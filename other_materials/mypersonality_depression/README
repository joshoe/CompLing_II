THIS DATASET IS NOT TO BE REDISTRIBUTED.

There are 939 users in the MyPersonality dataset who (a) answered all
questions on the CES-D and (b) had status updates.  


Files in this directory include the following:

939_userScores.csv

  User ID, time they completed the CES-D survey, and their total CES-D score.

  You can decide how you would like to threshold the score; higher value indicates 
  higher confidence that someone meets criteria for depression.  In the version of the CES-D at
  http://www.valueoptions.com/providers/Education_Center/Provider_Tools/Depression_Screening.pdf,
  it says:

   The score is the sum of the 20 questions. Possible range is
   0-60. If more than four questions are missing answers, do not score
   the CES-D questionnaire. A score of 16 points or more is considered
   depressed.


cesd_item_level.csv

  Contains user metadata, e.g. ethnicity, marital status, plus answers
  to the individual CES-D questionnaire questions, in case that
  information might be useful.  NOTE THAT FOR SEVERAL OF THE
  QUESTIONS, THE POLARITY OF THE 0-TO-3 POINT SCALE IS REVERSED.

   A file containing user ID, date, and status_update for a superset
   of the 939 users, in case you want to, for example, aggregate the 939 users'
   statuses a different way (e.g. weekly or monthly by author), or include
   the data from other users in  unsupervised processing.
