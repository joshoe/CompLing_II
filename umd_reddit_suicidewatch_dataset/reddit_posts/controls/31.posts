Does anyone know if crispy bacon is more healthy for you calorie wise since it seems that a lot of the fat drips off leaving kind of a brown crispy fat?

I think I had seen this clip as part of a Real TV episode. There was two announcers on a high platform, two stories perhaps, commentating to the viewers and there were a crowd of spectators cheering below. One of the announcers decides to get brave and jump down to the crowd thinking they would catch him but he fell flat. 
mcn8l	-60006	1321329077	geology	My theory on why oil is in the ground. Am I right or way off?	It seems to me the reason oil is in the ground is to cool off the earth's crust in the same way oil is used in motors so they don't overheat. The faster we take the oil out of the ground the faster it contributes to the earth heating up. Am I going in the right direction with this?

Both Jones and Jackson have been more consistent than Johnson thus far.  If Jennings stays out Jones will continue to be Rodgers's go-to (along side Nelson).  And Jackson is ranked 4th best fantasy receiver at this point.  But then again, it's freaking Megatron!  Any and all thoughts appreciated.  Thanks.

15wqqg	-60013	1357247857	Seahawks	What playoff scenarios, if any, would give Seahawks a home game in the playoffs?	I was thinking a Vikings win against Greenbay, leading to Seattle @ SF and Minnesota @ Atlanta.  If the Vikings go on to beat Atlanta I think we'd host Minnesota at the Clink.  This is based on having read somewhere that any surviving divisional champion will have home field advantage in the conference championship game.  If it's two wild card teams, the team with the head-to-head win gets home field advantage.  Anyone else know any other scenarios where we would get to play at home in the playoffs?

I can't help but see both of these missed opportunities as further evidence for an absolute ineptitude and complete blind incompetence in our ownership and higher-management.  I mean, are they just not paying attention?  For Russell, did they just forget about rule 5?  And as for La Russa, are they just choosing to ignore the amazing success of the 'cardinal way', a proven system - of which he was a big part - that fosters the kind of home-grown, championship-caliber, up-through-the-ranks players we all know we need???  I'm aware this may be rhetorical, just wanted to vent.  In the mean time Go Hawks!

From the few times I've seen you guys play I remember how much I loved your defense.  I especially remember seeing my Seahawks become particularly flustered by the creativity and aggressiveness of your blitz packages.  I'm just looking to learn more about your defense, what the general schemes and formations are, and what coaches (Arians, Bowles, etc.) are responsible for that crazy blitzing identity - if that is indeed a thing.  Thanks for any response.  Again, you guys are an exciting team to watch and I hope for a great game this Sunday.  ^^^Go ^^^Hawks!

Things are going very well, I have been studying ASL feverishly since we met, using the resources he suggested. We're spending more and more time together, and enjoying one another's company tremendously. We're getting closer to the point where I think we'll be looking to introduce one another to our friends, and soon thereafter our families. Can any other hearing/deaf couples give me a little insight on incorporating a deaf partner into a hearing family? I know that, over the long-term, I'll want my family to work on learning ASL so that they can fully incorporate my boyfriend. But I also know that realistically, that will take quite some time and effort on their parts, and while my mom and brother are likely to take to it quickly, my stepdad and my dad will probably be a little slower. What kinds of experiences have others had? Are there strategies you have employed to ease the incorporation of a new deaf partner into a family? Ideally, I would like him to be as much a part of the family as either of my brothers' partners, and I'm looking for advice from those with experience making that happen.

My partner's viral load is undetectable, but he is currently getting over a bout of influenza-A. He works in a hospital and its been going around so he was bound to get it. Does anyone here know, though, whether the influenza infection, or the tamiflu he's on to fight it, will have an impact on his viral load? (Yes yes, he's talking to his doctor about it, I'm just asking here to see if anyone in this group has any experience/knowledge in this area)

30ure6	-60026	1427751833	askgaybros	Wait out the break, or move on and don't look back?	I’m so into this guy. We’ve been together for about four months, which isn’t long but it’s long enough that I really know I want more. The problem is, we struggle to be able to make a lot of time to see each other. He’s in the service, active duty, and I’m a full time dad. Between his job and my family responsibilities, it’s hard to carve out time for a dinner date, let alone an overnight visit. Over the past month or so, he’s had to repeatedly cancel dates with me. Once was for something family related, the rest were because of being unexpectedly called in to work on days or evenings he was supposed to have had off. We have generally texted and or called each other every day, so its not like I'm getting ghosted. I have no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the cancellations.It happened again this Saturday I was frustrated and though I have usually been incredibly understanding, I went ahead and told him that this was getting harder and harder for me to deal with, because its been literally a month since we’ve seen each other and two since we’ve been intimate. I tried to not take it out on him, but I did say that we both needed to do a better job of finding ways to be more connected, if we weren’t going to be able to rely on regular dates and time together.He apologized, but went on to say that he loves me, and wants nothing more than to be with me, but that his job is eating him alive, and he’s been fighting hard with depression and PTSD, and he needs some time to sort things out and deal with his depression. “My head is not in the right place,” he said. “There are days that I don’t want to be touched. I have horrible nightmares. You are amazing and I can’t keep hurting you. I made a mistake thinking I was ready.”I was surprised and feeling more than a little hurt. I knew about his struggles already, and thought I was being supportive and understanding and caring. I didn’t think I was making things worse for him. This was literally the first time I had expressed even a little frustration, and even as I did I was clear that I wasn’t mad at him, just frustrated that things keep coming up. I asked him to help me figure out ways we can be connected despite his erratic schedule. Ultimately he said, a couple of times, that he doesn’t want to end our relationship, that he just wants some time to himself, to think and work with his therapist and try to get his head into the right place. I know many of you will say, “run and don’t look back, he’s too damaged.” And maybe that’s the right advice, but in so many ways he’s a perfect fit for me. Everything had been going very well, and besides the frustrations with struggling  to carve time out of our schedules to be together I really was starting to have visions of a real future. What do you guys think? Hang around? Make peace with this being the end? Wait for him? Date around but be open to figuring things out eventually? I need your help, bros. I’m still feeling pretty raw.

Hey guys.I've been fascinated with percussion all of my life. I finally got a well paying job, so I can afford this kind of thing now. While I can't get an acoustic set, I'm looking to buy a decent starter level electronic drum kit. I've done a bit of research, and it looks like Roland is the way to go if I want to get an electronic kit. The [TD-4K2-S-V-Compact Series Drum Set](http://www.musiciansfriend.com/drums-percussion/roland-td-4k2-s-v-compact-series-drum-set) is definitely on the high end of my price range, but it's the one I have been considering the most.Because I am new to this, would /r/drums have any better suggestions?Thanks!**UPDATE**I was browsing Craigslist as some of you have mentioned. Found a [Roland TD4S](http://www.musiciansfriend.com/drums-percussion/roland-td4s-electronic-drum-set) with drum amp and foot pedal for $550. Going to try to make a deal today!Thanks Reddit!

qzxdk	-60062	1331931948	Art	I have a few ideas for a comic book character but need help! 	Hey r/art I need your help. (to start with, i'm not even sure if this is a good subreddit to post in for this kinda stuff but here i go)I have two ideas for comic book characters with very extensive backgrounds, attitudes, clothing, powers etc. I originally wanted to sell my ideas to a company but i don't really "know" people for that kinda thing. That is why i'm writing this, i would love to do a collaboration with an artist here on reddit. They could draw and color (i could also help with coloring if they hate doing it) and i would provide all the necessary information and details for them to draw the character. I imagined making two or three comic strips (not full books) for the characters. The strips getting their main idea, background and powers across. Then when we were all done we could have our names down and say, "i drew and colored a successful comic strip" "I wrote the idea for a successful comic strip"Again, i don't even know if this is the right subreddit for this (if not please direct me) and -i'm super open to any ideas-! I just have (what i think are good ideas) and would like to see them not go to waste. TL;DR: I have two comic book character ideas. I want somebody to draw them.

What are the different ways i could go about attaching [these pieces of foam?](http://imgur.com/a/DG78E) (The two side pieces to the middle) Unfortunately im working with a really small overlap so whatever the method is, it needs to be strong/permanent. I thought about nice velcro that way it holds fairly well and if it needs to be adjusted while wearing it i could. But its a pretty small space for velcro. The back of the belt has large bits of velcro and is not going anywhere once its on. The back is the main 'fastening' area. Im open to having each piece of the belt separate or having the front piece permanent. Whatever works.Thanks!EDIT: The foam is currently in the mod podging stage.

1g87la	-60062	1371076208	cosplayers	[SELF][UPDATE] Super hero boot/taking out top slack progress.	I posted a bit ago about taking the slack out of rubber rain boots to make them more form fitting, and more super hero like. After lots of ideas, frustration and contemplating- i finally finished the boots. I'm super pleased with the results!I ended up cutting a slit down the back of the boot to about the bottom of the ankle. I then measured the overlap i needed to take the slack out, drilled holes out of the boot down the sides. Slipped the boots on and tied em' tight. They fit like a glove, perfectly comfortable to walk around in and the lace system works like a charm! I would STRONGLY advice using this method (or similar) for anybody trying to make classic plain super hero boot. Which are surprisingly hard to find/buy. Granted most classic plain super hero boots dont have laces at all but having them fit properly out weighs the laces. Also by putting the laces in the back when you pose for pictures and such they wont even be visible. If anybody would like a more in depth explanation of what i did im more than glad! http://imgur.com/a/gpFCn (sorry for cellphone pictures and black pants on black boots lol.) Now i'm off to carefully paint them and get red laces!

1f06jh	-60065	1369442238	AirForce	My Air Force experience so far... if you can't beat it, join it.	I'm a single A1C that will hit 22 months in the Air Force in a week.  I see a lot of posts on here from people interested in joining.  Here's my story, and some general advice I've thought of in the last two years.I walked in to the Air Force recruiter's office in 2011 knowing one thing - I was going to join.  I said the one thing every recruiter dreams of hearing... "Can you give me the first job that ships?"  He laughed and of course told me to slow down a little bit.I had some misdemeanors (disorderly conduct) to work out, and it was touch and go for a while.  I had to write a couple essays, both on my past mistakes and my current desire to join.  My waiver went all the way up to an O-6 (colonel) who called me up, and gave me a phone interview before he signed the waiver.I wasn't an easy case, but my recruiter worked for me.  He didn't roll out a welcome mat at first, and he never called me, but I stopped in once a week to see if there were any changes.  Once he saw that I was serious about this shit, he started pushing it upwards.  Recruiters don't need to hound people these days.  They have enough people walk into their office every day to keep them busy enough.  They have to wade thru the guys that come in every month "just to talk about it", the guys who "think it would be cool, but my girlfriend doesn't want me to leave", the kids who blatantly lie about their eligibility.Think of it not as a recruitment, but a job interview.  You aren't an all-star quarterback getting courted by a Division I school.  You are one of millions of 18-34 year olds that walk in to offices around the country every year, most of whom are just window shopping and want to take a practice ASVAB and score a free rubber airplane.  You have to sell yourself in order to shine through the bullshit applicants he sees every week. If you are wondering about basic training, I think that everyone focuses too much on that.  It's only 8 weeks.  You're going to make it thru unless you try to fail, or lie about medical issues.  I was a nicotine and caffeine addict til the day I got bussed through those gates.  I had a horrific headache and puked the first 3 days.  Guess it was major withdrawals.  I made it though, and so will you.I joined for 6 years.  Basic will account for 2.5% of my Air Force time.  Even if you only join for 4 years, BMT will be less than 4% of your initial enlistment.  On my dreamsheet in basic, I put all bases in the north, or on the coast.  I like cool weather and water.  I got stationed inland in the southern half of the US.  You go where you are needed.  If that lines up with what you want, then cool.  If not, you'll learn how to deal with it.Where am I now?  I'm a flightline maintainer, a job most people on here say to avoid.  I took it because it shipped me in 2.5 months.  Right now, I'm working 12 hour shifts, 6 days a week, somewhere in a desert.On the other hand, I've gotten to visit Texas, Florida, Las Vegas, the Azores, Sicily, and southeast Asia.I bought a decent car and paid it off in full.I've got a savings account and an Associate's degree now.I've got a team that I will work my ass off for, knowing they are doing the same for me.I have no idea what G.I bill I signed up for, or what color running shoes I wore to basic training.  I don't even know if I'll stay in this job for more than my minimum time.  I do know that time has been flying by, and I've set myself up for future success no matter what my choice.If you can get more done outside the Air Force in two years than I've done, then by all means do that instead!  I know that I couldn't be where I'm at any other way, and I don't regret any decision I made along the path.TL:DR  Recruit your recruiter, and focus on long-term goals.

I have two questions:1. How would I go about finding a specialist in my area for this on my own? I've tried Google, etc without any luck.2. Anyone familiar with this disease and can provide any advice on how best to manage it?Her body(I think) has trouble creating red bloods cells and thus she gets sick, fever, etc very easily. Anytime she losses blood(think menstrual cycle) she gets sick. My wife is Thai, 30 years old. She is about 5'2" and weighs ~95lbs. We live in Boston, USA.

Looking to buy, not build, a computer to hook up to my living room receiver.Primary use case will be watching 1080p video(movies, TV, etc) and listening to music. However, I also will use it as a traditional PC as sometimes I like to work at home using the big screen or remote in to my work computer. For this reason I was thinking Windows based with XBMC running on top? Or is that a bad idea?I will also use it to stream video to my mobile devices(currently I use Stream2me).

2wo5wa	-60068	1424539420	malefashionadvice	Suit Supply vs. Combatant Gentleman	I searched this sub and found opinions on both these budget suit makers but no direct comparisons. I own a suit from suit supply. Its comfortable and looks pretty good after only minor tailoring and its holding up nicely. I recently came across Combatant Gentlemen which seems like a similar concept (super 140's, half-canvas, minimalist/modern design) but less expensive at $160-200 vs $400-550.Has anyone owned both? Is there a material (pun intended) difference in quality?I live in a poor weather city, commute on hostile public transportation, walk outside frequently going to meetings, spend times at bars and wear a suit everyday for these activities so to complement my nicer suits I need a stable of suits I can basically beat the hell out of and not worry about but still look good and fit well.

Answer says time horizon is short because of the current liquidity requirements.The thing is the CFA text says that assuming a company is a going concern and there is no plan to wind down a plan the time horizon for pension plans is infinite.Anyone have thoughts how this kind of question would actually be graded? I could definitely see this being an exam question. Nothing in the errata from Schweser.

Except you.You wake up one day and in some trick of events, return to the innocent age of 9. You remember how you were at 9? Your mind is transfixed and immobilized in such a way that you think the way you did at 9 years old. You turn to your 9 year old self physically.All of your friends still hang out with you, despite that you're 9 years old and have no idea what they're talking about when they are referring to a funny sex story with their partner, quoting an adult film and sharing drug tales. You still do everything you used to do. You still go to college/job but everybody has to accept that you have changed. You don't know that you have changed. From that point you never age.

11tu0f	-60103	1350788921	Drugs	RC Stories	Bought a gram of Dust Till Dawn which is an RC that mimics speed. I did around 5 or 6 lines of it on a night out whilst drinking fairly heavily. At one point I remember meeting up with a couple friends and smoking some spice (never a good idea) and it was called Blue Cheese which the vendor recommended as a chilled euphoric high rather than the 'dribblers' like Annihilation that got banned. I took 3 or 4 drags before stumbling back to the beer garden. Once I sat down at the table I felt inexplicably high and felt a very depersonalized vibe whereby I felt as if I were somebody else spectating me and it felt too scary to put into words. I couldn't form a proper sentence, at least in my head and I felt incredibly paranoid. I got to one stage where all I wanted to do was just be alone and lie down and i felt pretty cranky and weird for half an hour later. When I came down I was just relieved to feel back to normal because I felt like I was stuck in a cyclone of phantom dissociation. TL;DR: We share ripping yarns of RC experiences, positive and negative.

EDIT: The initial effects after eating 5g was slight drowsiness and music appreciation. I waited around for an hour and when I decided it was underwhelming I put the rest of the bag (7.5g) in tea. I felt out of place like mild dissociation and felt increasingly more drowsy and tired. It lasted for a good 4 or 5 hours during which I had no urge for a cigarette as I'm a heavy smoker. Even the day after I didn't crave one. I feel that it could be used therapeutically to dampen nicotine addiction but recreationally, it wasn't enjoyable or intense as psyocibin in any shape or form. It was disappointing but if I get another chance I'll probably pass on buying it from a head shop and harvest it myself.

153w3m	-60103	1355924536	Drugs	Which substance, in your opinion, is the hardest to remember what happened afterwards? Also, what is your best blackout story?	After a pretty hefty dose of shrooms and mephedrone I found bits of scrumpled paper with drawings that I can't for the life of me remember when or why I did them.Best blackout story: Age 14 I was on a mountain drinking white cider and Famous Grouse mixed with cheap energy drinks. Everything was a fog and I remember waking in a ditch with about 10 kids on bikes shouting shit at me and throwing stones before transcending into unconsciousness and coming around again in somebody's garden vomiting over a girl I've never met.

15s17x	-60103	1357063182	Drugs	2c-i, MDMA, Mephedrone, Weed and Drink on NYE. My view on people at the moment is both terrifying and beautiful.	I don't know whether I'm glad that this experience happened but i bombed some 2c-i and a whole pill of pure MDMA (source is genuine) and when I got to the club I was completely awe-struck by everybody walking around. Everybody has a unique appearance and personality and it actually frightened me and gave me such an amazing introspection to the point where I wanted to be alone to gather my thoughts.Since that night I can't really look at the people I know any more it's as if I'm seeing them objectively as if I've met them for the first time. Anybody else had a similar experience?

164spd	-60103	1357584860	Drugs	Can't get to sleep and find eating very hard work after MDAI and Benzo Fury	Did 6-APB (purchased as benzo fury pill form) from a head shop earlier in the week around thursday I believe. I did mephedrone and weed the day before if that is of any use to what is happening to me currently. The 6-APB felt very strange but I enjoyed it until my friend left in the night when the MDMA esque empathy and mild stimulation had transposed into the psychedelic qualities. During this state I felt opposites of everything (tired but alert, pumped up but relaxed, warm but cold) which made me feel like I didn't know whether I was coming down or not for a long while, continuously checking to see if my pupils were still dilated as a sign that the drug is still sort of working. After forcing myself to sleep at roughly 3:00AM trying desperately to ignore the CEVs that resembled manic faces, I woke up feeling slightly refreshed but different. Maybe it was just cautiousness to the comedown confusion but it wasn't noticeable enough to stop me from thinking straight. I recommended the drug to try out and see for himself on Saturday night when I also decided to get MDAI on a whim walking to the head shop with him.I tried two small key bumps and felt a euphoric rush and mild sedative state on the car ride to my other friend's house where we were going to stay for the night. I pulled an all nighter, not being able to stomach any food because of how difficult it was to salivate (I did force down a banana and had some multivitamins and lots of water) and nearly finished the 1g bag of MDAI (ROA snorting mostly with bumps) with only roughly 2-3 medium sized lines left which I continued to do when I got back to my house to chill on the laptop talking to people. Despite only doing a minor amount and hearing from other experiences from first time users on drug forums that it made you feel sleepy I couldn't for the life of me get any rest. Throughout this night I couldn't eat again but still forcing small bite sized portioned meals down such as bread and rice as it physically made me sick. I finished doing the lines at around 6-7PM but around 4:00AM I could still feel very wide awake yet slow concentrating and forgetting what I was doing whilst doing it. It also wiped away all anxiety which made me make some rather unpredictable choices which the sober, not sleep deprived me wouldn't do, but that's a different story.In a moment of desperation I took 10mg of melatonin to knock myself out but I woke up feeling paranoid that I would die from starvation so I went down to the kitchen to eat 1 banana and to fetch a glass of water which was the only sources I could consume without physical exertion. When I went back upstairs I was wide awake and couldn't get back to sleep getting distracted by noises and constant arousal and a need to talk to others (some friends are mcat users who stay on facebook all night as well as friends from other countries) so I constantly distracted myself from falling asleep even though I had felt guilty and slightly manic about my state of health. I noticed time flew  past as is normal when avoiding sleep but I swear I must have had a couple bouts of sleep which lasted at least 10-30 minutes each time but felt like a couple seconds. I got up today and my memory and concentration has improved to the point of sobriety which makes me believe i had some sleep without realising.Anyway I haven't done the drug today but my pupils are still dilated (sleep deprivation and lack of food is the probable cause) but I still can go without sleep and food easily I have eaten today - fruit, a small portion of sunday dinner which was difficult but I did it anyway just because it was vital to eat. I had a driving lesson earlier which was probably a bad idea but I felt incredibly alert as if I did a gram of amphetamines. I was twitchy, incredibly talkative to my instructor, very fast and jerking my movements a lot. I have no idea what brought that on but it seems like i'm having stimulation in waves. So what is this from? 6-apb reacting with MDAI? Pulling an all nighter on MDAI which probably has taken twice as long to comedown from? I'm so confused and I want to be able to sleep well and eat again. What should I do?

19d9kl	-60103	1362016494	Drugs	My first time breaking through on Salvia 	I think I was around 16 when I had my first breakthrough trip on Salvia (x30). I did a fair amount before this experience but it was x5, x10 extracts sold in a shitty, murky test tube in this worn down head shop overlooking the school and generally felt like a fleeting bowl of weak weed. It had short-lived giggly effects accompanied by a pinch of confusion. Anyway, I asked my cousin to come try a few hits of the stronger extract with me at my house so we bagged up the purchase and strolled merrily from town, crossing every road without needing to stop and wait for traffic once as if Lord Divinorum was guiding the angsty hash heaving bummers on a path to salvation. This…wasn’t exactly the case. I’ve had some incredibly introspective times on psychedelics and have shifted my thinking to different states, for better or for worse but Salvia was not a kindred venture into my own head. The ego loss was on such an ineffable magnitude that I found myself at one point thinking there were little gnome like creatures building houses on my pooper. We’ll get to that later.I went ahead first with two respectable bowl hits. Almost instantly I felt a dissociative vibe with a sprinkling of cool salsa mild madness. My cousin did two, maybe three and decided to wait it out because he felt pretty uncomfortable. He likes to feel in control, in the zone and uh, I knew even then it wouldn’t pan out well. So in that split second wave of coming up like a penitent sunrise I nabbed the bong and filled the rest of the bag (a little under a gram?) and shot the shit with a jet lighter. Back then I was hiding my drug use from parents so we used to smoke spliffs out the window and look out for stray cats so you can imagine the fucking awkwardness ripping an acrylic whilst hanging out of a 2ft gap. I burn. I hold it in and start to count to 30 but as it gets to around 3 my eyes already drowse into blindness and feel like hollowed out grapes. No more than a second or two later I get flung back onto my bed by some spacey gravitational glitch. I’m still amazed how I managed to place my bong down on the window sill without so much as scratching it. Course, I didn’t think of that at the time because I was already writhing on the bed sheets laughing hysterically. To a sober point of view it must have looked like I was having the time of my life but I was frightened to fucking death. It was as if an unknown entity was forcing out its own laugh via my body because inside I was nervous and honestly, it felt as if I was getting taught a lesson by something otherworldly meddling with my cognition for abusing its plant.Buuuuuuuut, if you’re not on the spiritual side it could just be the kappa opioid receptor agonist causing me to lose balance, physically and emotionally. I started to cover my face with a cushion to numb my loud maniacal shrieking away from my parents who were actually asleep at this time and all the while I was trying to fight my own hilarity at…nothing. When it died down I regained a bite size chunk of balance and tried getting up only to stand frozen in awe at feeling every individual hair on my entire body grow. I stepped lightly around the carpet sensing all the fuzzy fibres of my being flutter away as my skin touched something. This was probably the only euphoric element of the trip which probably lasted about half a minute (which felt like a whole episodic feature in itself at the time) and then I descended back into chaotic confusion.I dropped to the floor and rolled around swiping my ass cheeks frantically. As I closed my eyes I was convinced there were trillions of diminutive denizens on my chunky rump constructing a society, a town, an empire. I began shaking violently crying my eyes out and screaming for my cousin to help me. I even remember looking up and seeing him stood by the window with the pipe still clutched in his hand but every time I tried to focus on what expression he might have had it shifted into a colourless unrecognizable mannequin-esque face.In retrospect I’d like to think of it as personified atoms and cells literally developing my own individual person in the same way that everything else evolves. Again, these are simply my own fabricated theories that I am guilty of over analyzing. It was probably just pins and needles combined with a twisted psychedelic dissociative imagination. I just remember getting up after that as if I snapped out of it and wondered what the fuck I was doing on the floor. I slowly came down but couldn’t comprehend anything that just happened, as is pretty common with intense hallucinogens. I just remember saying “Fuck, that was weird.” about 20 times to my cousin who was still stood with that pipe just pressuring me into what I saw. **TL;DR: Salvia is fucking awesome...i think**Haven't done it since (2 years) but I wouldn't mind giving it another shot. I live in the UK so it's pretty easy to just waltz into a head shop and snab some sachets of divinorum. Also, x30 is a doddle to most of you but I thought I'd share my experience.

1b0fbg	-60103	1364259183	Drugs	2C-D	Any experiences on this substance?Last week I bought a bomb of 2C-D on top of 2 bombs of some high quality MDMA and a few lines of methylone. I had some crazy visuals including strangers at the club I was in suddenly having demonic shifting faces that were staring me out coldly, wavy ripples in curtains and carpets and my perspective feeling closer and further at the same time which made walking feel strenuous. I don't know if you're familiar with the 'boxed' feeling or its just me but I've tried 2C-I under the same circumstances and it happened then as well. I don't know how to explain it other than feeling like i'm in a cartoon box vision. As if I'm viewing a movie and I'm some kind of robot. I've never tried a dissociative but i imagine it being a mild K hole. Anyway it made me zone out when it happened and then come back into reality feeling frightened. I've done shrooms countless times and I had the zoning out but not like this.When the MDMA was wearing off I believe I was still tripping from 2C-D coupled with the very anxious and paranoid feeling that ecstasy is renowned for. I spent it all restless with a friend of a friend that was also tripping and to cut the story short he was very eccentric and I could tell he was incredibly paranoid which made me paranoid of him being paranoid. Since then I've felt odd. I'm not sure whether it was situational and the experience scarred me somehow or it was the actual chemical/chemical combo. Nonetheless, I can't find much information on 2C-D so I wanted to know if you guys have any opinion on it. How does it affect the brain? Anybody mixed it with methylone and MDMA and have a story to tell?

Malcolm in the Middle became so much better since I started to look at how dysfunctional the family was in a realistic way.Hal - Psychosis. He's very eccentric and is compelled to act out on impulses and feels as if he needs to do it regardless. He's an emotional trainwreck and will break down if he feels as if he's in danger. Lois - Bipolar. One moment she'll enter a frenzy and does a lot of things she'll later regret in her depressed state. Reese - Antisocial. Reese definitely feels more comfortable with enemies and once someone approaches him as a friend he becomes suspicious of their motives. He also admits to hearing voices in a particular episode.Malcolm - Anxiety/Narcissism. Malcolm has an incredible superiority complex and only wants to be associated with others he feels are on his intellectual level but will strive for approval from popular kids just because he's self conscious about his image.Dewey - This is a tough one. Dewey is on the same creative level as Hal but likes to cause mischief for his own greed/entertainment in a sly manipulative method of appearing innocent. Dewey I think is actually the biggest asshole in the show because of this.

I made the split second decision to bomb 2C-B later in the night with two friends. The pill is about 30mg though I'm not sure but the threshold effects from what I've read on erowid were accurate so I didn't trip hard by any stretch. Note that I did try the same dosage about 2 weeks prior to that night and the effects were phenomenal but this time I'm sure the mephedrone dulled the effects of the trip so they weren't very profound but not superficial. In fact, I'd say the drone resolved the usual anxiety I get with psychedelics. Anyway since then I just feel empty. I've lost a lot of my creativity these past few days and can't get out of bed. I have mood swings a lot anyway but is this a serotonin issue or has 2C-B changed my brain chemistry/personality permanently? How do I resolve this? I'm terrified.

ek0hx	-60105	1292059098	canada	Canada can save the world.	Let’s save the world.  Let’s unite as one country, as one people and be the leaders the world needs.  This week, Stephen Harper was in Cancun and said that Canada would support a binding agreement to reduce greenhouse gases but only if all countries agreed to it.  This kind of statement not only shows that our government is disinterested in moving towards positive change but that it is merely a follower of whatever other countries are willing to do.  Saying that we’ll only do it if everyone does it means that we don’t want to but we will if we have to.  Harper is saying that Canada lets other countries decide our national policy.  Harper is saying that Canada is not a nation that leads.I say we change this.  I say we lead.One hundred years from now, how are people going to remember us?  We’ll all be dead but what will our legacy to them be?  Will they look back at those alive in the early 21st century as the ones that had the power to save the world but didn’t?  Will their textbooks describe our time as what can happen when good people fail to act?  The science is conclusive- unless we change our ways, there will be devastating global implications of the environmental degradation that we’re causing.  We might not be alive for it but our carelessness will cause the planet to change and people to suffer.  Ignoring that fact or hiding behind the hope that the problem will be solved later is to make a massive moral concession.  This concession not only condemns our children to live in a world very different from the one we’re in today but it also guarantees that they will remember us as cowards and failures.  Our generation will be seen as that generation, the one that knew they had to act but didn’t because they just didn’t have the will to.  For the rest of human history, the planet Earth will be as it is because no group of people was willing to stand up and do the right thing.Canada has a proud history.  We are a great nation.  From our national health care system to an individual who gives up their seat for a pregnant woman on the bus, everywhere you look, you can see people doing good things because they know what is right.  Today, we have an opportunity to establish ourselves as the country that did what it knew to be right and saved the planet.  When heroes arise from among the masses, it is because they were willing to sacrifice in order to do what they saw as right.  Canada can be the hero of the 21st century.  Every person alive 100 years from now will remember us, the Canadians alive today, as heroes if we choose to act.  A true leader takes steps forward not because they know others will follow but because they have the strength and courage to take those steps alone.  Only then, when a leader has emerged and a direction been set, will others take notice and follow in that path.  Let’s take those steps.  Let’s show the world that there are good people who understand the need to stop climate change and who are willing to do it.  Let’s blaze a trail.The collective action necessary to reduce our emissions to an acceptable rate is significant.  It may mean that we will have to pay a little more for the goods and services we use but our sacrifice now will be remembered and celebrated as the first time a people united and said “We are willing to do what it takes to stop climate change.”  Students will learn about it, sociologists will study it, our Children will be grateful for it.  All it takes is for us to make a choice.  As a nation, as individuals, we must choose.  Canada, let’s choose to save the world.

BURNERS HELP BURNERS IN SEATTLEChristian writes from Seattle:"In Seattle, one of the most influential couples in our Burner community are Dane Johnson and Kathy Justin. They are very visible in the Pacific Northwest (Arson Island, Flight to Mars, etc), and have brought the Burner world to the default world in extraordinary ways. (They were well known for events at their beachfront home, but it was B/IAS - The Burien Interim Arts Space (http://www.interim-art-space.com/) that may have had the biggest impact inside and outside the Burner community. Dane and Kathy seized the opportunity to turn a fallow lot in a blighted neighborhood into a year-long open-air center for the arts before it got turned over to developers to build out. They created a sculpture garden where Burning Man artworks were on display, and the space became an active hub for the Burien (and Greater Seattle) arts community.)So on November 23rd - two days before Thanksgiving - after a crazy storm left Seattle blanketed under an atypical crust of thick snow and ice, the community mobilized when a hastily thumb-typed email from Dane went out to one of the local email lists saying: 'Early this morning kathy and I lost our house. We have only a few hours to get anything we ever want to see aagaing out of our house. Any body who can help we would apreciate.. bring bags or boxes.' They lived on the beach in a groovy little 60+ year old beach bungalow. It had no street access and there were 158 steps down to their house. In the early morning hours the foundation cracked, the house tilted, the gas and sewer lines broke, and they had to get out. They grabbed every suitcase, box, and plastic bag they had, and started shoving their belongings into them. As people showed up, Kathy would point at things and they would get packed into a garbage bag and handed to waiting hands outside. A news helicopter hovered overhead, and two different news crews shot footage of the wreckage, while Burners and members of the Burien community helped heft garbage bags full of belongings up the hill. Within a matter of hours more than 150 people showed up in the snow and ice to create a "bucket-brigade" up the stairs to the street. D&amp;K's belongings were passed up the chain and loaded into a series of 4x4's waiting waiting at street level. Several Burners had brought food and coffee, and were keeping the volunteers fed and caffeinated in the freezing morning air. As each truck got loaded, it went to a Public Storage facility which had been closed until a Burner tracked down the owner and got them to open up and rent a new space to them! Inside the storage space other burners were stationed to sort the belongings out of plastic construction bags into boxes, label the boxes, and then stacked everything in an orderly manner. Later, Kathy said she didn't even know all this was going on until after the house was emptied, and they climbed up the 158 stairs and saw all the people who had shown up to help. She was just handing things out the door, but didn’t know where they were going... They also didn't know that Diem of Burners Without Borders had set up a BWB PayPal fund for Dane &amp; Kathy (still available here: http://bwbsea.com/ ) that had accumulated more than $2000 in donations since Dane’s original panicked email went out a few hours earlier. By the time they locked the storage facility about 4 hours later, that fund had doubled. Last I checked, Diem reported that it had doubled again. Before the day closed, the Red Cross had provided a local hotel room for a week (and Burners had been there and stocked the refrigerator and liquor cabinet for them), and other community members had offered at least three different homes for D&amp;K to stay in indefinitely, including the Mayor of Burien who offered them her own house! As it stands today, just 4 weeks later, Dane and Kathy continue to express their amazement and gratitude for everything their communities have done for them in their time of need. As people more used to Giving than Getting, the incredible outpouring of support and love really knocked them off-balance, and it took some time to get used to being on the receiving end for once! The 10 Principles of Burning Man are amazing things to experience in the dusty heat of Nevada. It’s one of the things that makes Burning Man such a unique experience, and such a life-changing one at the same time. But when you bring those principles with you off-playa, and live them out in the default world, suddenly the world becomes the kind of a place where amazing things happen. Whether it is a culturally-transformative experience like B/IAS, or 150 people coming out in the snow and ice to help out friends, a community based on the 10 Principles is a powerful force for good.So while you celebrate the holidays in your warm home, think about the people in your community who are not so fortunate, and do what you can to help.Your faithful scribe, Christian 'Bucky' JacobsenIgnition NorthwestSecretary &amp; Communications Chair"From Burning Man Update: The Jack Rabbit SpeaksVolume 15, Issue #5December 22, 2010

f1aqt	-60105	1294886697	canada	In light of the changing tone of politics in the US, I want to start a petition urging Harper, Ignatieff, Layton and their wives to have dinner together.  No media, no public comments after about what they discussed, just dinner with some coworkers.  	Our political leaders need to remember that their first and biggest responsibility is to serve the public.  They all work for the same boss- the taxpayer.  Just because they represent different interests doesn't mean they shouldn't be able to get along like colleagues.  If heads of different departments in a normal workplace bickered in the same way our politicians do, their boss would give them hell.  I've always thought that the best way to bring people together is to sit down and share a meal.  So I think we should push for the 6 of them to get together for a casual evening at 24 Sussex and just eat, drink, and chill.  No media at the dinner and they all promise not to disclose how the conversation went.  If the media wants to know what went down, sure they can say something like "Dinner was delicious" but keep it at that.  Don't politicize it and don't turn it into anything more than just a small dinner party with some people from work.  Sure, there might be some animosity that carries over from the office but regular people are able to interact civilly with coworkers so I'd expect them to be able to as well.Anyways, upvote if you think it's a good idea. Down, if you don't but if so please comment constructively because I feel that this idea isn't perfect but has some potential.  Any advice or help on getting this started would be super cool.

As a member of the AFP team, I'm sure you believe in its mandate and its policies otherwise you wouldn't want to be working for such an entity.  I don't expect I would be able to nor will I attempt to change your perspective on this matter but I do want to say something to you.   America is on a path that may very likely lead it to absolute financial ruin.  Macroeconomic policy and individual decisions are contributing to this risk.  Considering the wealth divide, the increasing debt, and the general state of the economy, it seems possible then within the foreseeable future, the America you know today will change drastically and the prosperity that it has enjoyed for so long will be a memory.  If this happens, there will be two groups, a suffering majority and a massively wealthy minority for whom there will be no significant decrease in the quality of life.  If this happens and it happens within our lifetimes I want you to remember this email and know that you worked for the wealthy individuals who were actively pursuing their own interests at the expense of regular people.  AFP exists because the Koch brothers believe that the policies it advocates for are ones that will further their own interests which is to say increase the profits of Koch Industries Inc.I believe you are a good person, an American who does what they perceive to be right and holds beliefs that are formed based on your experiences.  Think about who you work for and what their aims are.  Remember this email.

[Here is the link to their volunteer page.](http://www.ootc.ca/volunteers.php)It's a "faith based initiative" but there's no preaching or any attempt to convert people who use the program and you don't need to be religious to volunteer.  The locations are mostly churches around the city and I think most volunteers are drawn from the congregations of those churches but it would be great to get a strong contingent of atheists volunteering.There are various jobs you can do like kitchen prep (no skills necessary), serving, and overnight shifts (you don't have to do anything, just keep an eye on the kitchen while studying/watching movies/whatever).I volunteered with them in the winter of 05/06 and am just getting back into it now.

ob3dt	-60105	1326219605	BurningMan	In 2001, thousands of people in the UK and other countries listed "Jedi" as their religion.  If we did the same as "Burners", it could be a first step towards the legal right to get the week off as an unpaid holiday.	[Here's the link to the Jedi story.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk/2757067.stm)I'm not sure if I would describe Burning Man as a religion but it definitely has many of the characteristics of one- a series of core principles, symbols, a pilgrimage, a global community built around a common identity, and shared values.I'm not religious in any normal sense but I can honestly say that the most "Spiritual" experience I've ever had was with my girlfriend in 2008, when the man collapsed and we ran up as close as we could get to it.  I think a lot of people have a similar feeling towards the burn and this could form a legitimate basis for classifying Burners as a religious group.I'm not suggesting calling Larry Harvey a prophet or any nonsense like that, I just believe that in its current form, Burning Man could fairly be described as the closest thing to a religion that many people have.  Just because it's not thousands of years old or have a "God" doesn't mean it can't be just as legitimate of a religion as anything else.  Buddhism doesn't have any sort of Supreme God in the usual sense.  I'd also suggest that many Burners adhere to a set of common values more closely than a large percentage of people who profess to be Christian.Doing this would probably give the haters more to rant about but haters gonna hate.  The only thing I'd be worried about is if calling it a religion discouraged people from wanting to attend for the first time.  However, I believe that with careful communication and explanation of what we mean by "it's a religion", this could be avoided.Obviously, calling yourself a "Burner" doesn't conflict with any other sets of beliefs you may hold.  I think the idea of Radical Inclusion would mean that people already part of a religion could still be part of this one.Anyways, it's possible that this idea may have been proposed or written about before but I've never heard serious discussion about it.  Credit for the idea goes to my friend Bryan but after waiting forever for him to post on here about it, I've decided to write it up and flesh it out a little.I'd like to know what people think.  I don't think it's definitely a good idea (it might even be a terrible idea) but I do think it's worth talking about.edit- I'd like to add that the Jedi thing was more of a joke/atheist statement/fandom movement.  This would be legit.  The Jedi thing just provided the idea to list being a Burner.edit2- There's a percentage of people downvoting (obviously expected, this idea is kinda crazy) who I think would be especially valuable to hear from.  There's probably a lot of problems with this that I haven't thought of so, if you dislike/feel iffy about it, please share!)'(

I just read this great article about how the whole fact that BM has tickets seems to be somewhat in opposition to the principles of the event itself. [LINK](http://dalelarson.com/2012/02/why-is-burning-man-still-selling-tickets-at-all.html)Got me thinking.  The whole ethos of BM is based upon the notion that this is a city, not an event.  So how does that jive with the fact that you need a ticket to get in?  What sort of community charges admission?  What is the nature of Burning Man? Is it a community centered around an event or is it a community, pure and simple?Something has changed.  Burning Man seems to have outgrown itself.  I hear lots of talk about regionals becoming more important but all those arguments seem to consolatory to the fact that the burn just can't handle the number of people who want to attend.What does it take to start a city in the desert?  Vegas did it.  Can Black Rock City do it?Could Black Rock City become a prototype for a better future?  All a city really is is people and infrastructure.  For the millions we're spending creating and extracting a fully functional city, could we just be investing in permanent infrastructure?  [A biofuel waste treatment centre](http://designtoimprovelife.dk/index.php?option=com_content_custom&amp;view=article&amp;id=587&amp;catid=18&amp;Itemid=287) and a [solar power plant](http://www.blackrocksolar.org/) could eliminate the need to haul portapotties and generators out there every year.  [Gerlach and Empire have been decimated by the Gypsum plant closure.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/21/empire-nevada-recession_n_881816.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000009)  But out of the ashes, opportunity?  People do live there already so it's not like setting up a colony on the moon, clearly it's possible to sustain a population there.Working would be possible.  Telecommuting via the internet might be possible for many burners in the tech industry.  Massive infrastructure investments would be necessary.  Difficult? Yes. Impossible? No.I don't know if I would move to Black Rock City... but I might. Having you as a neighbour, well that'd be pretty cool. Life would be hard and it would mean sacrificing a lot (especially initially).  But those first settlers and people setting up the infrastructure would be gifting something of incredible significance.  They'd be ushering in a new era for this community that is starting to feel more and more like a displaced civilization.  We need to go home.

Generally I try to be optimistic that I'll be able to spend my money/time on an adventure I haven't done before but then I see a photo from the playa or think about my friends who have tickets and just get really depressed.

We'll be in Orlando for a few days and we're looking to find the local orphan burn and/or find any cool burner events that are happening around then.  If there isn't anything currently planned, it would be cool maybe just to have a little burner meetup, share some beers from our native land, and play with some fire.We usually camp with Opulent Temple and are big on participating so if you need a bunch of hands to help with the orphan burn build/logistics/whatever, hit us up!

2xaydn	-60105	1425001874	canada	My thoughts on C-51	20 years of staunchly supporting the Liberal Party of Canada and I've had enough. I’ve volunteered. I’ve given money. I’ve been an elected exec of my Federal Liberal riding association. But I can’t support Trudeau as he so blindly supports a bill like C-51. My deepest respect and gratitude goes out to Rosane Dore Lefebvre and Canada's New Democrats today.There are two camps in this debate, both motivated by fear, but looking in completely opposite directions. I understand why so many MPs are pushing for or supporting this bill. Less than a year ago, someone entered Parliament with a gun and a fierce firefight erupted. To be working in that building on that day would be terrifying. It would be traumatizing. Going back into that building every day thereafter would be a constant reminder of that trauma.Now we have a government that is legislating not through rational discourse but out of the traumatic experience they shared. Whether it was an organized terrorist attack or just a single person suffering from mental health issues, the trauma and fear experienced that day would be the same. If I had gone through something like that, I’d probably feel the same way. But less than 0.000001% of Canadians have ever experienced something like that and it’s unlikely that percentage will ever rise significantly.Harper isn’t evil. Harper isn’t some crazed villain trying to create a dictatorship where he can monitor our private lives. Their motivation is, for better or worse, to protect Canadians from the kind of fearful experience they had. But this is where they falter. They are looking back, with fear, at a single event and trying to prevent it from happening again. This has blinded them to the future.I don’t believe the Conservatives or CSIS or any person alive today is going to use C-51 with anything but the best intentions and noblest of purpose- to protect Canadians. But it’s not them we should be worried about. The politicians currently supporting C-51 are doing it with good intentions. They have no desire or intent to abuse the powers granted by it. But one day these politicians will leave government. And then one day after that the politicians who have replaced them will leave too.How can we know how C-51 will be used 25 or 100 years from now? What if, 50 years from now, a leader gets elected (could be from any party) on a wave of resentment towards a particular group of law-abiding citizens? Will there be anything to stop them from using C-51 powers to find, target, and persecute those people?How do we stop abuses of power like that from happening? The answer is to not give those powers.To prevent misuse of surveillance power, we must maintain the primacy of personal privacy. Our freedom won’t be taken away in one sudden, deliberate legislative action. But it can be eroded slowly. When we give government the tools to erode our freedom, it’s only a matter of time before someone comes along who will use those tools. That’s what I’m fearful of. That’s the risk that the future holds. And that’s why C-51 must not be allowed to become law. Not for us but for our children and their children and every generation after.

30bsue	-60105	1427335681	UofT	Open Letter to Cheryl Regehr, in reply to her articles on Huffington Post	I just emailed this to Cheryl Regehr and several members of the administration, student unions, and media-edit- For the record, I am an undergrad and not a TA or in the union.  In addition to being a student, I am an entrepreneur (with a couple successful businesses and two more in the works), and I work part-time for CFS-Services where I negotiate corporate partnerships with national brands for ISIC.  The letter below reflects my personal opinion on the matter and isn't written on behalf of any group or organization.&gt; Open Letter to Cheryl Regehr, Vice-President &amp; Provost, University of Toronto-&gt; &gt; Over the past few weeks we’ve seen two incredible things happen at the University of Toronto.  First, the Times Higher Education (THE) World Reputation Rankings came out, with UofT maintaining its position as one of the top 20 schools in the world.  Second, a strike by the university’s TAs has opened a community-wide dialogue about how its graduate students are compensated.  This debate has been between two opposing sides, each with its own perspective and motivations.&gt; &gt; The University of Toronto negotiators represent a group of administrators doing their best to effectively manage a massive multi-faceted organization that suffers from serious budget constraints.  The CUPE union represents thousands of graduate students who create knowledge every day, adding value to the university and earning it its place on the World Reputation Ranking.  By looking at these two supposed adversaries with a broader perspective we can see that the nature of their relationship is more aligned than the PR battle and picket lines might suggest.&gt; &gt; Both UofT and the researchers that double as its TAs have a common goal of creating knowledge.  As one of the world’s premier research universities, this is a school known for its incredible scientific and social contributions to our world.  Students from across the globe strive to be part of this amazing community. This, despite the fact that it is constantly fraught with major structural challenges including a perpetually strained operating budget.&gt; &gt; It is this strained budget that gives rise to the most important challenge facing UofT today.  Graduate students are the backbone of this community. They are Teaching Assistants, they are researchers, they are the frontline of support for undergrads, and they create knowledge.  They do this in a system that pays them for only a small percentage of the total amount of work they do.  The hours spent on TA responsibilities are only a fraction of a grad students’ total work.  A typical week usually includes 10-12 hours of paid TA responsibilities in addition to 40-60 hours of research work (which precludes any possibility of an outside job to make enough income to reach the poverty line).  This work, done under the banner of UofT, creates value for the university not only in terms of prestige, but real measurable revenue in the form of patented discoveries, external funding, grants, and the tuition from undergrads who choose UofT because of its reputation.&gt; &gt; In any other context, this creation of value would be properly compensated. Researchers in the private sector, doing the exact same work, are paid for the time they spend creating value for their employer.  The organizational structure at a university, however, is such that its workers are not treated like employees, but like customers.  Graduate students must pay for the right to work for the university.  The administration argues that they are students so aren’t entitled to an hourly wage but they are the workers driving the university’s production.  They produce discoveries, publications, and knowledge which gives the university its reputation as a great school, and, for that contribution, they are asked to pay tuition fees which are barely offset by the wages they receive.&gt; &gt;The administration accurately quotes $43.97 as the hourly TA rate offered in the latest agreement.  However, when factoring in the full work a TA does over the course of a 40 hour work week, their hourly compensation works out to $7.45 per hour ($15,500 annually).  This is significantly below the poverty line.  This is how the current system treats the highly educated and incredibly hard working researchers who create knowledge and improve our world every day.&gt; &gt; This is the nature of the challenge.  How do we, as a society, value the contributions made by our best and brightest?  How can we allow our top institution of higher learning to pull itself apart in a battle that pits two groups of highly dedicated and noble academics against each other over an amount of money that is a tiny fraction of the cost of one new fighter jet (the government wants to buy 65)?&gt; &gt; Knowledge is the lifeblood of our economy.  Education is what makes our business leaders effective.  New discoveries and methodologies drive innovation in industry.  Every part of our society benefits from having a strong system of higher learning., and research must be encouraged and supported.  We can not, and will not, succeed in the 21st century if we do not properly address these systemic challenges facing universities today.&gt; &gt; This is what the CUPE 3902 strike is about.  Forcing the university to pay a living wage to its workers will be an unprecedented challenge for its budget but is doable, especially when its forecasting a $194 million surplus.  That is what our goal should be.  The current system is broken.  Public funding for universities is at an all time low.  When the administration, CUPE, undergrads, and the citizenry can unite in a call for better funding of our public education institutions, we will be able to create the political will to reverse this dangerous decline.  However, that change will not come about without a major catalyst that is able to force the government to properly address this issue.&gt; &gt; We need CUPE to continue this strike as it fights to correct the injustice its members face.  We also need the administration to resist the temptation to sacrifice academic integrity for “academic continuity” or make budget-driven systemic compromises to the quality of education it offers.  And what we need most of all is for these sides to come together, and pursue a true society-wide structural solution that ensures UofT continues to be the world-class institution this country needs.

What the hell, Pan Am marketing team?	Anyone else not know that was going to happen? I was aware of the smaller display they did in the early evening but didn't know there was going to be a bigger show later. I would have loved to see it.  Maybe just my own stupidity for not looking into it when I heard about the small early evening one but it would have been nice to have it be promoted better.  Especially since it would be so easy to see from so many places in the city.edit: To clarify, because I don't want to be a total downer and as I've mentioned in the comments below, I am interested in the games, I was all over the website last week, tried to buy tickets for some events (the sport I'm interested in sold out early), and I do plan to check out the pan am park next week.  But what does their communications team expect when the vast majority of advertising directed at local residents over the course of many months is about how inconvenient the games are going to be and they literally keep it a secret that there is going to be something awesome that pretty much everyone could enjoy.  In the end, it seems the fireworks were seen by a small handful of photographers and maybe a couple hundred people who happened to see it from the sidewalk.  Tell us the bad, hide the good, and expect people to be excited for the games? PR disaster.

So, I am interested in what it takes to build a finical future that will leave my future loved ones and I with a comfortable future. what should I be doing now that can most greatly impact the goal I have set out for myself. Is it stocks? investing in particular types of business that are "safe" never buying anything without the cash to back it up? (if thats possible) how do I accumulate enough capital to be safe, and still take risks that can lead to good returns? give me your best advice!

2cvsf7	-60121	1407419121	medical	concussion and psychosis	well, I have a long history of psychoactive drug use (three years)(current age 21), which after a bad experience left me with ptsd and psychosis. I understand that it was my choice and I've lived with it successfully, however something weird has happened. While at work I was putting up a forty foot ladder by myself and right before it went all the way up it popped out of the ground coming back and smashing me in the head. the concussion was immediate, I felt like I had lost 20 iq points and couldn't remember much at the time. Its been a day and while my brain feels swollen my psychosis symptoms seem to have disappeared. the symptoms are typically seeing the full spectrum of lights, halos, feint fractals, patterns, moving without moving ext... and its gone. Im not sure if this is possible! could a powerful blow to the head have caused something like this to happen? any advice would be good, and yes I am going to the Dr. as we speak.

2fdlhc	-60121	1409767935	personalfinance	in college, need a car, insurance is 4000 a year.	So let me offer some background. I'm 21, I live in the north east, I am going to school and I get good grades. I was involved in an accident when I was 17 and have put off getting a car because I'm from a poor-ish family and I have to earn all the things I want. So, I saved up my money 4000 and bought a car (3000). (I did this so that i would have registration cash left over) and I even waited until I had an extra 1500 in the bank as a safety net as you wonderful people here on finance have recommended. because I earn the things I want I would not settle for any ol' car, I bought a mk4 golf gti with a vr6 engine in it. now it sounds like I'm being young and stupid, but I bought the car for its engine which is very reliable and I have connects that can make repairs and preventative maintenance easy. the problem is I have had an accident and my parents can't put me onto their insurance because they have business insurance and well, having a child is not a business expense. so my insurance cost comes out to be 1850-ish every six months (if i can make the payment) or a bit over 4000 a year in monthly increments (stupid auto insurers). what can I do?How much do grades help battle my premium?why is my insurance lady saying that my accident history won't disappear for !10years!!is there a magical place out there that understands my situation and can help?I thought that by using an agent that has multiple insurance companies at their fingers they would get me lower rates, but it seems like they searched for the highest... or does it go higher :(

3i4tk4	-60124	1440371361	relationships	My [29M] (ex?)girlfriend [33F] of 11 months lied about taking her birth control and now thinks she may be pregnant	So a couple days ago she tells me that she's done with our relationship because she wants someone "older and more established" and doesn't want "to be stuck with some broke ass man" for her whole life. She then proceeds to spin things over the next few days about how this is me abandoning her. She starts having a meltdown, saying the meanest things she possibly can, messaging my family telling them that I've "pushed her too far" and threatening to post naked pictures of me on my business website. I have literally done NOTHING wrong. We weren't arguing. I haven't cheated. Nothing. But I've somehow pushed her to this.Hours later she starts texting me saying that she's uploaded the naked pictures to my business site and someone for the complaint department messaged her saying it was under review. (This is a lie. I manage the site. There is no complaint department and nothing was posted anywhere.) She then tells me that for the past month and a half she hasn't taken her birth control. (We had argued previously about her wanting kids and me not wanting them. In fact, when I brought up the idea of a vasectomy back then, she freaked out and made me swear up and down that I hadn't gotten one and not told her. We agreed to revisit the topic once we had moved in together and were both more established in our careers.) So she apparently has been lying to me about taking the pill and also says she hasn't had her period since she stopped taking them.I'm so confused. I don't understand why she's breaking up with me now, we've never even argued about money (though she can be materialistic). I don't know if she's lying about not taking the pill. I don't know why she'd break up with me now if she thinks she might be pregnant. And I don't know what I'd do if she actually is pregnant. I'm a fucking mess right now. I'm so confused, heartbroken and angry. What on earth is going on!? It's like she went crazy overnight.**TL;DR: Girlfriend broke up with me a day before telling me she sneakily stopped taking her birth control a month ago and thinks she may be pregnant**

2yp17v	-60145	1426093233	TapTitans	How high is the wall and how hard do you push	Tournament mode.  Shadow clone ran out of useful steam at ~1900.  Non-berzerker tapping ceased to be viable at ~2000.  Berzerker tapping stopped being effective at ~2060.  So here I am at 2095 trying to match the guy at 2500 who got there within an hour of starting.  I'm using power of tapping, berzerker and throwing everything at it.  I'm moving about 2 levels per 30 minutes.  Normal tapping is now a joke.  Can I go for broke on this in the next ~6hrs?  Jaqulin is at 1787.
2ys6y7	-60145	1426158087	TapTitans	Resetting skill cooldowns. Exploit?	Is this by design?  When you tap a skill which is on cooldown, the cost in diamonds to reset ALL cooldowns is tied to whichever skill is closest to cooling off.  Have done several tests.  So, you have Berzerker Rage at ~4m.  Leaving a 26m cooldown.  Hit Berz Rage, hit Heavenly strike at the same time (assuming maxed CD on both skills).  Let Heavenly strike get down to 1 second before it has cooled off and the cost in diamonds to reset ALL cooldowns will be close to one diamond.  (in testing, actually got it to show EXACTLY one diamond).  Leave it a second longer, so HS has now cooled and tap Berz rage (still with 25m+ to cool) and the price will shoot up to 70 odd diamonds.  Seriously, weird.  Means if your Berz rage lasts just under 5 mins, you should always hit Berz, then HS, then manually reset the CD when HS has 1 second left to pay close to one diamond for a full reset of all skills.  This feels... exploity.  Especially since the price shoots back up again.  Definitely seems the price to reset ALL CDs is tied to the skill, closest to cooling off.  Ultimately, with a bit of focus and attention and a handful of diamonds, you can get an almost perpetual Berzerker rage.
2zh69y	-60145	1426693202	TapTitans	Tournament fundamentally a broken system	The scale of cheating is too great.  If GH ever get around to working out how to negate the issues, it will already be too late.  The folk who are speeding up their game to a ridiculous rate are able to triple the speed (even outside of tournaments) of the game, to the extent that they get in three times as many prestiges as those who do not.  This results in them having much higher level artifacts = further progress in the tournament.  Even *if* Game Hive somehow negate it, these cheaters will have already amassed all the weapon upgrades they need to kick the hell out of those who do not cheat.  Ultimately, if you do not cheat and play legitimately, you will not win.  Image when/if they remove the infinite damage issue and the 2500 cap.  Give up on getting a top ten spot unless you're cheating.  It is a real shame, I love the game, but that tournament is the worst thing ever implemented.  I would much rather have an offline/single-player challenge way of getting weapon upgrades, which does not expose me to the raft of cheating morons.
2zp7bo	-60145	1426860014	TapTitans	What do you love about Tap Titans?	With all the bashing going on because of the update, I wanted to share why I'm addicted to playing it and hear why others love it so much (to the point of getting angry when changes happen).  ----------  1. The feeling of *progression*. It actually feels like I am getting somewhere and improving with every prestige and upgrade I get.  2. The fact it is entirely playable whilst only semi-concentrating (either with shadow clone or tapping) so I can watch Netflix at the same time.  3. It is playable in small chunks or long stints. I can even play on both my iPad and Droid phone simultaneously for added challenge!
3099g9	-60145	1427294989	TapTitans	FAQ Sticky post	Can we have a sticky post for an FAQ please.  Getting silly having five people per day ask the same questions, just because they've gone off the page.
316y3l	-60145	1427983563	TapTitans	Long Shadow Clone manual refresh	So I just found out something cool I wasn't aware of and which helps me...  Just upgraded myself to a ten minute shadow clone, for some great afk TT. All well and good, but a couple of things were happening:  1. I was stuck with whatever taps/sec I had upgraded SC to, until he finished and I restarted him.  2. I was constantly wanting to reset it back to 10 mins, so I could wander to the kitchen and make a cuppa.  Now, short of coming out the app, killing it and going back in, this was problematic.  So I tried something new.  The way it's implemented now (on Android, not sure about iOS), once my SC has been going over 5mins, such that the background cooldown timer for it has expired, if I tap on the icon again, it clears the timer.  (It doesn't actually stop the current SC, it just keeps on killing).  I can then re-apply the SC, with it picking up the newly-upgraded taps/sec.  (And wander off for ten minutes to get a cuppa).  It's odd, I can literally clear the timer and retain the SC, then just upgrade it and re-apply it.  Even get the animation of it dying and spawning back up again.  Something odd happens if I tap the icon and I still have &gt;5min left... the timer just gets reduced by 5 mins!!  No idea what's going on there.  Wonder if this is usable on the perma-berz-rage notion.  i.e. if we got it to 30mins, you could still manually cancel it at any time and re-apply it (with the upgraded rage level on top).  More testing!

Give us a +1000 button, etc.  I think it needs to go back to basics...  Remove the bonus relics from hero levels and merely re-adjust so that they are distributed from stage milestones instead. Without the relic reward from hero levels, there is no need to level them, ad nausium. Levelling heroes goes back to what it should be...  beneficial from a damage/skill acquisition perspective, rather than a grind.
31usm8	-60145	1428484491	TapTitans	Removing latest Android update	Anyone Android experts know how I can remove the latest TT update?  Quite naturally, I don't want to be stymied in the tournament by being capped at 2500, so I'd like to downgrade my version of TT back to what it was at least night when I foolishly updated.  Cheers in advance.
323nzw	-60145	1428656519	TapTitans	A good battle	So after the Android update hit to re-establish the 3000 cap, I went for it from 2500 as far as I could.  One guy was already at 3000 and another was at 2673.  Targetting the second place spot, I went crazy for a few hours and made it.  (From 2660-2673 was painful).  Matched him at 2673 to share second place.  Went to bed.  Woke up with 30 mins of tournament left and he had nudged up to 2703.  No way I could reach him.  This was a proper battle I enjoyed.  He pushed me, I pushed back, he wasn't settling for sharing the spot and pushed again.  He must have really earned that second place. If he could've reached 3000, he would have done so.  On a side-note, I've played TT regularly since installing it... I guess 6-8 weeks ago.  Have ~435k% AD and the usual trimmings on Artifact levels, obviously.  What I cannot fathom is what on earth crazy damage it would take to get to 3000, given there are no more heroes or evolves left, so it must be done on damage alone.  Further to that, is it even feasible to reach whatever damage level is required since TT hit the store?  Even if played 24/7 since release, would it even be possible to get to 3K, legitimately or are these 3K cappers *definitely* hacking the game?
323tfc	-60145	1428661427	TapTitans	Which do you prefer, for the level cap?	* A cap which can be legitimately reached, but which sees quite a few people sharing top spot, or;  * A cap which is solidly out of reach for legitimate players, so only hackers can take top spot, but the battle below them is hard-fought.    Results:  * Achievable level cap: 3/3  * Hackers-only level cap: 0/3
32oxs0	-60145	1429110959	TapTitans	So I tried cheating once... and now I do not... but...	Within the first couple of days of playing, I pushed my phone date forward a day to see if I could reap the offline gold.  All that happened was I got the message about not cheating (and no offline gold).  That's all I did, several months ago.  Everything else seems fine in the game and I only ever play whilst connected to my wifi, so no issues with offline gold or the tournaments.  My google games, however, has got me stuck at 1,088, apparently.  (2673 is actually my highest stage).  While I don't care too much about the google games progress, I am concerned that if ever GH do some sort of blanket sweep of "cheaters", I'm going to get caught up in it.  Has anyone ever rid themselves of this "cheater flag" ?  If so, how did you do so?  Do we know if GH will provide any system of rectifying this flag?  As far as I can see, my fruitless attempt at gaining one day of offline gold is not quite the same as the hex editor posse who give themselves several billion relics and then compete in the tournaments.
32siyv	-60145	1429181629	TapTitans	Working whilst "playing" TT	For those folk with TT on whilst at work, has anyone come up with any nice ways of positioning/rigging up their device, such that they can keep an eye on the shadow clone running out?
338ggv	-60145	1429538978	TapTitans	Android tournament has more hackers than iOS?	I play TT on Android and iOS.  I start the tournaments at (almost) exactly the same time, although I have varied my start times in an attempt to find a "hacker-free" slot.  If we presume anything over 2800 is a hacker, the numbers run like this so far:  * Android : At least one hacker in every tournament (usually 2+)  (100% of the time, there's a hacker in the tournament).  * iOS : saw my first hacker at the weekend (at 3000).  (&lt;5% of the time, there's a hacker in the tournament)Granted, this is a tiny sample size, but does this resonate with anyone else?  Is it just so much easier to root a droid than jailbreak iOS?
34ynnv	-60145	1430847015	TapTitans	What the heck happened?	So, I took a week out on a work conference where I was too busy to play TT. I come back and hit the weekend tournament. Get lucky in in a couple more DL weapons (total now: 9) but still needing one more weapon for four full sets.  Prestige after tournament and roll through again, barely paying attention.  Get to ~2550 and notice SC is still one-shotting everything without BR...  Looked buggy.  Kept going.  2700 and still no BR and he's still one-shotting.  Eventually slowed a bit, so I kicked in BR.  Got to 2825 before it slowed to the point of feeling a few taps might help.  Without much of an effort, I hit 2910 before feeling it had slowed to a typical prestige moment (non-tournament).  I pondered whether those two DL weapons I just got could've made that much difference... but no way.  So now I read there have indeed been some changes snuck in.  Bit of an arse there was no notification of this in the game or in the form of any update.  Surely a small splash screen when I started the game telling me some balancing issues to hero levels/gold/damage have been implemented would've been useful...?  Now I read perma-clone is being changed...?I've got a 15min SC at present, are we really saying this we suddenly still incur a 5min "cooldown" timer when it expires?
35duxt	-60145	1431169292	TapTitans	Tourney grouping : more than just a time window	So I finally lost the plot and start a TT game on my work iPad as well as my home iPad (neither of which is my main game - my Android phone gets that honour).  This new game sees me with about 200% AD and one artifact.  It's tap-tastic and takes days to get to 80.  The other iPad has around 10k% AD and can hit into the stage 800 area.  I started the two iPad game tournaments at EXACTLY THE SAME TIME.  Guess what...  they end up in different tourney brackets.  Low-and-behold, the "rookie" iPad game ends up in tourneys where the top spot goes to people around stage 500-700.  The iPad which packs more AD% punch gets tournaments with the top spot going to a 3000 and 2nd place a 2700ish.  So what else - apart from time window - does the grouping algorithm use?  AD%?  Number of artifacts?  Previous best stage logged?

1iuium	-60148	1374535576	loseit	Low calorie diet + exercising 4+ times per week and still not losing	I'm a 34 year old female, 5'3" and approx. 153 lbs. My whole life, I have struggled with my weight. In the past, I have been able to go from 180 lbs. to 132 lbs. by cutting food volume and with moderate exercise.In the past few years, my weight has slowly crept back to my current weight. I understand that this was due to bad food decisions and lack of exercise. However, I'm ready to change all that.Approx. 6 weeks ago, I started eating ultra healthy. I was eating healthy before this for the past year or so, but 6 weeks ago was the turning point. My average day looks something like this:Breakfast:an orange2 eggsa pepper or two small rye hard breads (FinnCrisp for the European folks) with a slice of cheese on eachLuncha peppera carrotsome tomatoesperhaps a little ham/chickenDinnerveggiessome protein, be it beef or chickenEvening snackapple with peanut butterA rice cakeI log my foods using fitday and on an average day, I take in approx. 1300 calories (~ 40 g fat/85-100 g carbs/100 g protein). My husband and I are also in the process of trying to get pregnant, so 10 days out of the month (ovulation date until aunt Flo arrives - TMI, but may be important), then my primary exercise consists of walking 5K and/or some other form of light cardio for 45 minutes to an hour. Since we've had problems conceiving, it's recommended that I don't do any exercise that bounces my body up and down to the extreme, so HIIT and running are out of the question for those few days. According to Runkeeper, I'm burning approx. 300 calories per workout during this time and I try to go out Monday to Friday, but at times, it ends up just being 4 times per week.The rest of the month, my daily exercise includes Insanity, running, etc. for 45 to an hour. My calculations, thus far, put me at burning between 400 to 600 calories per workout and the frequency is everyday Monday to Friday.During the past 6 weeks, I haven't lost anything. I'm starting to get discouraged and wondering what I'm doing wrong. I've read multitudes of things online, from not netting less than 1200 calories to making certain that I eat my minimal daily caloric intake. I want this to be a diet that I can continue to practice for the rest of my life, not just some quick fad fix.My ideas thus far are to:Incorporate weight training, or in my case, since I don't have a lot of free weights, it would be resistance training with bands.Increase leafy greens, such as broccoli and brussel sprouts, although I already eat those pretty much dailyIncrease chicken intake and fish, as I currently have beef 2 to 3 times a weekStart eating more beansI do have cheat days during the weekend, which would consist of something like the following:Friday - normal diet plus a piece of brownie and a little candySaturday - repeatThus, my cheat days consist of just a few sweets, so I'd rather spread them over 2 days, than try to eat everything in one day.I'm open to suggestions, ideas, etc. other than diet pills and trend diets (such as fasting, LCHF, etc.), as I don't feel that I'd be able to maintain these in the long run and I get grumpy when I don't eat. I'm looking for something well balanced and future proof, something that I could maintain for the rest of my life, obviously decreasing or increasing quantities for weight loss and maintenance.Thanks!

My companions (2 in particular) find it incredibly annoying when I combo out, which confuses me; there are other 2-card combos in our group that will annihilate people (Sanguine Bonds + etc.), and infinite combos aren't exactly hard to find in the first place in our group, but whatever. To spare my group from having to bellyache needlessly, I'd like some suggestions on how to make Niv-Mizzet need Curiosity/Ophidian less. I'm okay with still having the combo inside, but I'd prefer a method that is perhaps less direct. This deck is my favorite color combination and I love card draw. I appreciate any help you can provide!

1jp3nl	-60162	1375647303	DnD	Questions about Fighters and Wizards in 5th Edition	Hello everyone - I'm super excited for 5th Edition, and was wondering how fighters and wizards are portrayed in it. If anyone playtested it, I'd like to know how they are built up. My experience with Fighters in 3.5 and 4th was very different. Fighters had a more well-defined roll in combat, and it seemed like you were doing a lot more than the "I swing at the dragon with my Longsword" from 3.5. However, it was a little annoying to have to remember what all of your powers did - playing them felt a little like playing some sort of spellcaster from previous editions. How do Fighters work in the new system? Do you have a pool of maneuvers to choose from, or is it more fluid and skill-like? (ie just using Strength checks to shield bash versus having it as an actual power). I felt like 4E did a good job of bringing down the power level of wizards, but I could never get over the fact that they lost so much of their versatility from 3.5's core rulebook. To me it seemed like you were basically just a combination of Evoker and Abjurer, with some other stuff sprinkled in. It was annoying to have to wait for them to be more fleshed out in later supplements. How do Wizards work in 5th edition? Do they feel overpowered? Are they strictly on a Vancian system of memorizing spells, or do they have a selection of At-Wills to choose from? 
1jupsg	-60162	1375838837	DnD	How to handle mass battles?	I'm a big fan of history, and would love to include some battles in my future campaigns. Now, I love good ol' fashioned dungeon brawls as much as the next guy, and I'm certainly not going to do this more than once in a campaign, but I think it'd be a cool story element for the players to take part in, with their decisions carrying real weight - will they route the Khan's horde? How will the King feel if they neglected to save his son in order to press a momentary (but critical) advantage? I want the players to feel like their characters are operating as crucial combatants on the battlefield, and so would like to incorporate the standard dungeon-like combat system, and I know that more than a couple of my players are going to love hewing through mooks left and right. However, I am extremely hesitant to run something that involves any more than 10+ NPCs; it'd get exceedingly tedious to calculate the individual attack and damage rolls of an entire legion's worth of NPCs.How have you all managed this in your respective campaigns??

1nw399	-60162	1381122297	StarWars	What are your hopes for Lightsaber Combat in the new movies?	I've been thinking a lot lately about what my favorite duels were in the Trilogy and Prequels, and how the new duels could be done in the new movies. Now, I'm fully aware that Abrams isn't gonna troll subreddits looking for ideas, but I kinda felt like expressing what I hope for in the new movie, and I'd like to know what you guys are hoping for too!I'd really like the new lightsaber duels to be grittier. Being a fan of martial arts movies, I can't help but notice just how often guys use their whole bodies during a fight. I'd also like maybe to see a little less flipping about and superfluous spins (may seem at odds with the whole martial arts theme, but please - Yoda was enough, and the way Sidious started combat in ROTS was kind of amusing). Personally, I'd have no problem seeing the hero's lightsaber get busted and then watch him summarily beat BBEG into a bloody pulp using nothing more than fists and spite. Hell, let's see someone's face get blown off with a blaster, or a guy get maimed with a vibroblade. I'm not asking to turn this into a Tarantino film here but...eh, I feel like Star Wars, with all its laser swords and starships and aliens, could use a little combat grounded a little more solidly in reality (granted though that combat is involving lasers and lightsabers). My greatest fear is that Abrams is gonna force it into something that's all somersaults and elaborate parries, with CGI stand-ins doing hilariously impractical moves. What do you think? What are you hoping to see in the new movies combat-wise??? 
1oeruj	-60162	1381732393	StarWarsEU	Tython and the Nature of the Force	So I've played SWTOR for awhile (don't play any more now though) and Tython was my favorite planet. It was gorgeous and so peaceful - only when you weren't fending off Manka Cats, crazy old Sith war droids, and  Flesh Raiders though. Anyway, it seems that the planet used to be wracked by powerful Force-triggered storms, and that by achieving "Balance" they could keep them under control. Many say that this implied a balance between the Dark Side and Light Side of the Force, but Tython is obviously not in turmoil because only the Jedi are there during the time of the game. And even if a balance of dark and light keeps the planet nice and calm, does that really reflect the nature of the Force? If that's the way the planet is, that doesn't mean that the Force has to be that way too. What do you guys think? 
1qpped	-60162	1384546509	DnD	How to use illusions against PCs?	I was wondering how you all handle illusions being used by monsters or npcs against your playgroup. How do you have everybody make will saves/wisdom checks/attack rolls against Will without making it painfully obvious that what the group is allegedly seeing is all in their head? I'm trying to craft an encounter with some Efreet, and in accordance to my perception of them, I want them to be both destructive and tricky - for example, I wouldn't mind forcing the players to fight some illusory guards/monsters so that the Efreet have time to pull up reinforcements, or have some scary thing/rolling ball of doom chase them down the hallway and towards areas where they will be more vulnerable. I don't wanna have a situation where "yeah, it's an illusion but you have to act like it isn't, because I asked for wisdom checks"; I want them to honestly be in situations where they don't know what is a trick and what isn't (until they honestly catch on and actively try to determine what is real and what isn't). Until now, I've shied away from this because I didn't know how to make it work. How have you all managed illusions in your own games?

1t2owo	-60162	1387263827	DnD	Appropriate Undead Enemies	So I'm planning a campaign where the players need to go visit an old seer, who consulted the dead and foretold the future that way (a necromancer in the truest sense of the word, I'd guess). Only problem is, is that he was a servant of Kelemvor, who is not willing to allow his servants to come back once their allotted time is up. I'm going to have the players descend down into the Underworld to find him, but I need some appropriate enemies for them to face. I've already got the RP stuff in mind, but what kind of monsters would they expect to face down there? I've already got the spirits of the departed, and some mindless skeletal myrmidons who will guard the entrance to the netherworld, but what else should I throw in? Zombies won't exactly fit because they won't exactly work with what I've got in mind. The Underworld should be where disembodied spirits reside after death, and I'm okay with skeletons because they are sort of mindless automata that I can see sort of helping Kelemvor to run the joint. Any ideas? 
1tq7hf	-60162	1388046434	DnD	Need ideas for a debate with a Grell Philosopher	So I'm having my players encounter a Grell Philosopher and his mind-controlled monster-minions, but I'd like to give the players the option to "reason" their way out of the encounter by engaging in a rather stirring debate with him - in fact, I'd almost prefer it, although the penalty for losing said debate will be that the Grell tries to eat them. Any suggestions as to what they would philosophize about? I was thinking of something along the lines of "why shouldn't I eat you?" but that seems far to simplistic. I was hoping for something along the lines of "Support your argument, point out logical fallacies, and provide rebuttals". Any ideas? It would be hilarious if it was something so far out there that they didn't know quite how to address it, but philosophy isn't my strong suit so I'm quite lost. 
1uzm8k	-60162	1389479931	DnD	[Next/5.0E] Charging, and using Sshamath's divination school	I had a quick question regarding how the Charger feat works with multiple attacks in Next; does the +5 damage apply to all attacks I make as part of a Charge action, or just the first one? Additionally, if I as a fighter use my Action Surge, do I thereby gain +5 damage to those additional attacks I gained from it? Also, a quick question about how to run my players in Sshamath - as those who have extensively played FR know, Sshamath is a drow city that is a magocratic oligarchy, in contrast to the traditional matriarchal theocracy of most Drow cities. I want to involve the College of Divination in it, but how exactly can power struggles take place if there is a group of people that can Scry out an enemy's secrets or see what you are going to do in the future before they do? I want the college of divination to be like the Intelligentsia of Sshamath, providing valuable information to their comrades and spying on other schools and the Church of Lolth for profit. Now, if that's all that divination did, it'd be cool, but how can I give my players the ability to do something unexpected and catch them by surprise if they can see the future? 
1w3rwb	-60162	1390638963	TrueAtheism	My Criticisms of Presuppositional Apologetics	So I was recently listening to the dogma debate between AronRa and Sye Ten Bruggencate (a prominent presuppositionalist). It appears that the gist of Mr. Bruggencate's position is that one must presume the existence of a deity in order for any reasoning to be performed, in particular the christian god, and that without a belief in god you can't actually know anything. He also asserts that the only way one can escape the circular nature of logic (ie, using your reason in order to justify your reason) is to have some transcendent entity around to (for lack of a better term) magically beam the knowledge into your brain. What follows are my observations, and I would welcome any comments or criticisms of what follows herein1.) **TAG (Transcendental Argument for God) can be used to justify any major religion.** Literally everything Bruggencate or your PSA (presuppositional apologist) can be used, by changing the deity or deities and holy books referenced, to justify the existence of any particular god or goddess you want - in fact, just about anything. One could claim that "The Great Cheesewheel" is the source of all knowledge, and that one must presuppose its existence in order to know anything at all. In this way, TAG is useless in order to prove the existence of god because it can be used to prove EVERYTHING or ANYTHING is god. No reason is provided as to why the Christian god needs to be the deity presumed. It's therefore nothing more than a bald assertion. It is something presumed - hence why it's called presuppositional apologetics I guess. 2.) **In order to presume that the christian god is the deity required for knowledge to exist, it follows that the Bible must be without question true in every aspect, or true in at least the parts that matter to christians.** PSAs therefore also presume the inerrancy of scripture. Since the bible makes numerous claims that are actually contradicted by an enormous amount of evidence to the contrary (garden of eden, a worldwide flood, humanity being descended from only 2 people, the exodus) then the christian god cannot be the the correct one. This renders the initial TAG premise "the presumption of [the Judeo-Christian] God is required in order to know anything" as completely unfounded. If p, then q; since not p, therefore not q. I find it rather telling that Bruggencate refuses to discuss the Bible with nonbelievers, or attempts to avoid it by saying something along the lines of "that's an interesting topic for a different debate/bible study" (You can hear him say this on the Dogma Debate on YouTube). He apparently thinks that since only Christians can do so because they understand where knowledge comes from (in of itself an assertion that needs substantiating, and a fallacy at that - one need not know where a car comes from to use it), but I suspect that he avoids topics on biblical inaccuracy because it calls his entire premise into question. Even were he not a biblical inerrantist, the bible is clearly not a history textbook and many of the claims that it has made either cannot be confirmed or are patently false, rendering his 1st premise (ie, God must be presumed in order to know anything) false. 3.) **PSA is an un-parsimonious false analogy.** PSAs will state that since reason is the point of origin for an atheist or traditional apologist's worldview, and I guess are presupposing it to be reliable, then they can presuppose the validity of scripture. Whereas the atheist or traditional apologist is only using the tools of rational analysis, the PSA has imported the idea that the Christian God is real, has created a specific product (The Bible), and then interacts with humans in a specific way, and presumably uses that in conjunction with rational analysis. The former needs only the tools of rational analysis, but the latter brings in an entire belief system which must be also justified. Given no other contributing knowledge (ie, proof that the PSA-imported belief system is correct in its entirety), Occam's Razor forces us to discard PSA until corroborating evidence can be provided. PSAs compare apples to oranges when they are asserting that God is the starting point for rational analysis. 4.) **PSA asserts un-falsifiable divine revelation as justification for their beliefs and downplays the importance of reason, when in fact reason is active at every level of their cognitive process.** This point is somewhat related to point 1, in that TAG's unfalsifiability allows a believer of any religion to use it. Bruggencate has said that he knows he is divinely inspired because "God reveals things such that we can be certain." This is not a testable claim at all. I have no way to test whether or not he truly has heard god's word - how do I know if he's telling the truth, lying, or simply deluded? AronRa provided an example in Newton, who claimed divine inspiration for his anti-trinitarian beliefs. Bruggencate was unable to provide a reason for why he should be believed above Newton, and his evasion is telling. Furthermore, he is attempting to use reason in order to justify his revelation from god, so a PSA cannot simply state that revelation trumps reason if reason is being used to justify it in the first place! Bruggencate would rather obnoxiously ask "well how do you know that?" in response to any question instead of giving an actual answer, but he doesn't seem to realize that it can be turned against him - if a PSA claims divine revelation, just keep asking them how they know that. It's essentially the same thing that they keep asking an atheist or traditional apologist "how do you know that your reason is good if you use reason to validate reason?", only in their case what an atheist or traditional apologist asserts is empirical whereas divine revelation isn't. 5.) **PSAs must use non-biblical justifications in order to justify why their particular interpretation of the Bible is the correct one**. Because their acceptance of the Bible is foundational, they can't refer to it to when attempting to justify it or else they resort to question-begging. If they give a non-bible-based reason for why to accept a certain element of their bible (or the bible they chose to follow) is true, then they've admitted that there is a non-foundational basis on which their beliefs can be justified. Essentially, they either have to give up the premise that the Bible is the word of God or resort to circularity. A PSA will undoubtedly refer to divine revelation though as the source for their knowledge - but that revelation is un-falsifiable, and their acceptance of revelation is a product of their acceptance of scripture, and so they've essentially resorted to question-begging again. 6.) **PSAs falsely states that you must need to know the source of logic in order to use it properly.** This is patently ridiculous - I don't need to know how or where a car was made in order to operate it. The same thing goes with logic. I'm typing this on a computer right now - I don't know how on Earth it works, or where the heck it was made, but I can use it, and that's all that matters. I welcome your comments and criticisms - what do you think about these? What are the potential problems and pitfalls? What points are good, and which points should be shored up/extrapolated further? Ultimately, I've found Mr Bruggencate to be enormously arrogant (listening to his remarks on the dogma debate are quite annoying, although I also didn't like AronRa or the others remarks on occasion, as they seemed a little rude at times).

1yke7p	-60162	1393015556	DnD	Advice on roleplaying chaotic neutral and true neutral characters	So I'm having difficulty explaining how exactly chaotic neutral or true neutral characters behave. Specifically, I've had problems dealing with a player who plays chaotic neutral as "I'm an utterly selfish person, fuck you, fuck this, I'm not helping you, I'm going to try as hard as I can to make this game difficult but get away with it because that's how I roleplay this character". I want to be able to coerce him to follow certain plot guidelines via roleplaying without him having to be forced to do something by DM fiat or have the party drag him kicking and shrieking along for the ride. This player is most definitely NOT a trouble player at all - his builds have always been well-balanced, and he has roleplayed previous characters in a very mature, sensible manner, and he has utmost respect for me as a DM (and I him). If I could better understand how this troublesome alignment system works, then I could perhaps better get his character to behave in a manner that is both less obnoxious and more believable (and also less senselessly sociopathic). My best example I guess of a Chaotic Neutral character would be Jarlaxle Baenre from RA Salvatore's books. He definitely thrives on chaos, on going against the grain, and being somewhat of an obnoxious cheeky bastard to the females running Menzoberranzan's power structure. He loves luxury and the finer things in life, but won't hesitate to manipulate innocents (though this is usually done in a non-lethal or non-hostile way) to get what he wants. However, he's not unnecessarily destructive, nor does he seem to derive a whole lot of pleasure from violence for its own sake. He also seems to derive pleasure from things that aren't related simply to violence or lust or greed - he goes galivanting about the surface because he loves freedom and adventure, and his gift of Idalia's flute to Entreri is selfless. He wants Entreri to cease being close-hearted, and to open himself up from his icy demeanor. He wants his friend (and he truly is his friend) to live his life to the fullest. True Neutral, I honestly can't think of any examples off the top of my head. So what do you guys think? What are your tips/interpretations on Chaotic Neutral PCs????
1zha4g	-60162	1393890461	SagaEdition	Dark Side Points and PCs	I need a better way of dealing with DSPs in my game. My players will just gather up DSPs, until they are one away from being NPC'd, and then just spend a force point or engage in heroic acts to stave off the advance of the evil Force-cooties. I have made using the Dark Side tempting for Force users (can use ANY force power if they spend a force point and accept that DSP, in addition to getting an extra dice roll for modifying rolls), but there just doesn't seem to be a penalty for having a tainted character whose like 3 or 4 DSPs away from hitting their wisdom score. I would like to play with tainted Jedi, and have a character who struggles with their internal demons, but it seems like there's no way to reflect this mechanically, and I've already got players who abuse the system as it stands. What have you guys done to make the Dark Side seem tempting but dangerous??? 
203jgb	-60162	1394499478	SagaEdition	Matukai talent and Pin/Crush	So I have a player who is rolling an Adept, and noticed that the Wan-Shen Mastery feat allows users to initiate pins with the Wan-Shen. He is also going to take Crush down the line, so he can deal damage once he pins somebody with his wan-Shen. My question is this: will the crush damage be coming from his unarmed attack, or from the Wan-Shen itself? He can pin characters one square away because the polearm has reach. It doesn't make much sense for you to deal unarmed damage with five feet of space between you and the unfortunate pleb you've gored with your force-enhanced glaive
207i9m	-60162	1394602969	StarWarsEU	Jedi Action vs Inaction in the Yuuzhan Vong War	So I'm planning on making a Saga edition campaign for some friends of mine, but I need to know why Skywalker wanted to keep the Jedi out of the war initially. I haven't been able to find a compelling reason, or at least one that is coherent and makes sense. I really wanna incorporate this into the campaign, as it is a potential RP gold mine for my players, especially if they are Jedi. Durron's argument is rather well-stated and coherent: "Vong are a threat, we have the Force, let's smash them into pieces to save the galaxy from the genocidal threat they pose". Luke Skywalker's, on the other hand.....not so much. What exactly did Skywalker hold to? And I also must ask - for those of you who read the NJO books, as I did awhile back - what was your OWN personal opinion on what should've been done, and why? Love this subreddit guys! You all are the reason I come here :)
22cq04	-60162	1396802178	prochoice	Some counter-arguments that I heard the other day	Hello r/prochoice! The other day, a friend and I were discussing abortion, and he is very much against it. He raised some interesting and rather good points (to me) about abortion that I would like to know your opinion on. He was very much prepared for it, and I not so much. I'd like to see how reasonable his arguments stand to you guys1.) I argued that if you cannot be forced to donate an organ to your child, then you shouldn't be forced to support a pregnancy. The point of my argument here is that you cannot be forced to violate your bodily integrity to save someone's life. He somewhat sidestepped the issue, and said that it comes down to the situation - in a pregnancy, you had a choice to have sex and therefore should deal with the consequences. He admits that consent to sex isn't consent to pregnancy, but one must consent to the possibility of pregnancy. When it comes to a child who is sick and needs an organ, then that wasn't a choice anybody made - nobody walked into a situation in which they might have to replace an organ. Essentially, he's saying that if you have made a choice to engage in an action that may have disagreeable consequences, then you should have to deal with those consequences, much in the same way that if you choose to drive you will have to deal with the consequences in case you crash. What do you all think? How would you address this argument? I'm of the opinion that it simply doesn't matter whether it was a "choice" or not - nobody can save their life by violating my bodily integrity against my will. Choice has nothing to do with it (I feel like my friend was somewhat straw-manning me here, and answering a question and rebutting a point I neither made nor held, but regardless I feel like his choice argument is interesting and kind of compelling). 2.) He says that just because you cannot support a pregnancy financially doesn't mean that you should "execute the child" (his words, not mine). Why is terminating a pregnancy permissible when it comes to talking about financial burdens, but you cannot kill a child that's already here? Why can we not kill the retarded or physically crippled once they are with us, but it's okay when they are inside the womb? My friend argues that simply because life would be extraordinarily difficult, and that the child would be a financial burden, doesn't mean that you should terminate the pregnancy. He would consider adoption to be a much better option. Why not simply adopt?3.) My own question here, one that I've been wondering for awhile now: where do you all stand on the "person-hood" of a fetus? I cannot logically find a way to not say that it's a person; a human already here completely lacking any cerebral abilities, totally dependent on the care of others, would still technically be considered a person, wouldn't it? It doesn't matter on how advanced or far along a pregnancy is, it seems - if you can't draw that line with people who are already born, then how or why can we do it when they're unborn fetuses?I thank you all for taking the time out of your day to answer my questions here :) It really helps. I'm just trying to hold as few unreasonable positions as possible, and I completely recognize that I could be wrong and want to fix that. 
247vf7	-60162	1398718559	SagaEdition	Using Kota's Militia during a post Order 66 campaign	Hello there everyone! So my group is involved in Kota's Militia in a campaign I'm running, and I thought I would give you guys some insight into how I am working and running it for campaigns. For starters, at least initially, Kota's Militia isn't packing a whole lot of firepower, and I have this reflected in their fleet composition: 1 Nebulon-B escort frigate, 1 Rebel MK-assault frigate, 2 or 3 Corellian Corvettes/Gunships, and maybe 4 or 5 GR-75 Rebel Transports. So, what does this kind of fleet composition tell us about their tactics? Well, for starters, they aren't going to be engaging in slug-fests with Imperial fleets. A single star destroyer will be more than a match for most of their ships, with the exception of the assault and escort frigates, so this forces them to engage in hit and run tactics. Players will necessarily then be involved in trying to find lightly protected imperial bases or transports, as the more heavily armored ones are simply too large and well-defended to take out. This can force the militia into an awkward position; the light targets don't carry too much war material, and so the fleet as a whole is only just barely scraping by with what they can capture. They potentially risk losing it all if they go for the heavy, juicy targets, which means that the players will need to rely on skillful roleplaying and subterfuge to capture imperial warships, technology, and supplies. Since Kota's Militia is cash-strapped and fuel-lacking, they are constantly looking for new sources of income and supplies, be they from the pirates and Hutts or dissident noble families and senators. The Militia should therefore straddle a rather uncomfortable line between dealing with pirates or corrupt senators, and using those ill-gotten gains for good. Perhaps the weapons the group would buy were paid for by unfair taxation? Should Kota's Militia, and by extension the players, support corrupt organizations so they can fight the ultimate corrupt organization, the Empire? Since Kota's Militia resides in a somewhat grey area, feel free to explore that in your campaigns. For the Militia ground forces, I chose to have the troops reflect their overall strategy. The troops are divided into 3 classes: the Saboteur, Soldier, and Assault Trooper, all based on and inspired by TFU game. Here they are: Kota’s Militia SaboteurMedium Human Nonheroic 8/Saboteur 3Init. +6; Perception +5; HP 38; Threshold 14; Speed: 6 squaresRef 19, Fort 14, Will 18Melee: Bayonet +9 (1d8+2)Ranged: Rail Detonator Gun +10 (3d8+1, 1-square splash)Abilities: Str 12, Dex 15, Con 13, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 10Talents: Skilled Demolitionist, Shaped Explosion Feats: Armor Proficiency (Light), Weapon Proficiency (Rifles, Pistols, Simple), Skill Focus (Mechanics), 	Skill Training (Deception), Skill Focus (Mechanics), Weapon Focus (Rifles), Combat Reflexes Skills: Deception +10, Mechanics +15, Use Computer +10 Equipment: Blast Helmet and Vest, Rail Detonator Gun, Bayonet, 3 land mines, Comlink, 150 creditsKota’s Militia SoldierMedium Human Nonheroic 8Init. +11; Perception +5; HP 22; Threshold 13; Speed: 6 squaresRef 18, Fort 11, Will 11Melee: Bayonet +7 (1d8+2)Ranged: Blaster Rifle +11 (3d8)Abillities: Str 12, Dex 16, Con 13, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 10Feats: Armor Proficiency (Light), Weapon Proficiency (Pistols, Rifles, Simple), Weapon Focus (Rifles),	Point Blank Shot, Skill Focus (Stealth)Skills: Initiative +11, Stealth +16Equipment: Armored Flight Suit, Blaster Rifle, Bayonet, Comlink, 150 creditsKota’s Militia Assault TrooperMedium Human Nonheroic 8Init. +2; Perception +10; HP 30; Threshold 14; Speed: 4 squaresRef 20, Fort 14, Will 10Melee: Stun Baton +8 (2d6+2 stun) Ranged: Light Repeating Blaster Rifle +8 (3d8, 2x2 area [braced]) or Burst Fire +8 (5d8 [braced])	Light Repeating Blaster Rifle +5 (3d8, 2x2 area) or Burst Fire +5 (5d8) 	Frag Grenade +8 (4d6, 2x2 area burst) Abilities: Str 14, Dex  15, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 10, Cha 8Feats: Armor Proficiency (Light, Medium), Weapon Proficiency (Simple, Rifles), Point Blank Shot, Burst 	Fire, Weapon Focus (Rifles)Skills: Endurance +11, Mechanics +10, Perception +10Equipment: Battle Armor, Light Repeating Blaster Rifle with portable power generator, 2 Frag Grenades, Comlink, 	150 creditsSaboteurs set and shape charges such that as many enemies as possible are caught in the blast, with survivors being funneled towards any of his or her allies. Soldiers will take cover and lay ambushes, and either draw enemies towards blast zones or pick off the ones that survived them. The Assault Trooper sets him/herself up in an area somewhat hidden, and are either used as a distraction (so that Soldiers can sneak around for ambushes) or to bring overwhelming firepower on problem enemies. Overall, Kota’s Militia prefers set ambushes and lightning-quick skirmishes to open, set-piece battles. Combat encounters with them (or against them) are intended to be brutal, swift, and literally explosive. A typical squad is: 5 soldiers, 2 assault troopers, and 1 saboteur. Their preferred tactics will encourage players to RP situations so that they can maximize damage and minimize casualties; for example, perhaps they can draw out some suspicious officers to a dinner party, then mercilessly and brutally annihilate them with plasma and shrapnel. For those groups that LOVE combat (as mine does), the tactics that Kota's Militia use can serve as inspiration for how to run them - short, sweet, and brutal, with the little time it takes to run them leaving plenty of time for RP and still being very satisfying. The surprise tactics can level (quite literally) the playing field, allowing your group of players to take on foes easily 3 or 4 times their number. If anyone has an questions or comments, let me know! I'm always interested in improving games, even my own!

I dimly recall in a QnA session Mike Mearls mentioning that the fighter would get some sort of "Mageknight" option that would fill in that gish niche (hehehe), but I thought those of you playing Next would like to see my adaptation on it. I felt like, since the attack progressions are all the same for the classes, it'd be easier to take a wizard and give him certain proficiencies than to take a fighter and give him spellcasting. However, I'm kind of at a loss as to how to run things from here - I'm not very familiar with how swordmages operated in 4th edition.

You are also proficient with the Longsword, Shortsword, Rapier, Scimitar, and Greatsword5th: Extra Attack - you gain an additional attack per round Hasty Casting - 1/encounter you may cast a spell as a swift action; this spell does not provoke opportunity attacks.

Because force sensitives are at least even dimly in tune with the Force, they can sense how much it has been warped by malice and despair, and it effects their ability to draw upon the Force accordingly.

I've decided that the group will be going after a crazy dwarf-king who has been driven mad by grief, avarice, and his Ring of Power. How would you all craft it, knowing that 5th's got such an emphasis on small numbers? Here's what I have so far: Ring of Power: +1 attack, AC; +10 HP; +1 to spell attacks and DC's; may be used as an arcane or divine implement*within the presence of any Nazgûl, the wearer immediately loses all of these benefits; additionally, the wearer gets a -2 to all Will and Fortitude throws while within a Nazgûl's presence. The wearer may prevent the loss of abilities with a DC 13 Wisdom check; the -2 penalty still applies to this check, however. *While worn, the ring inflames the wearer's avarice, jealousy, and lust for power. 
2elfz9	-60162	1409024201	DnD	Silvan Elves vs. Tribal Humans? What's the difference?	I'm making a campaign setting and need help determining what differences might exist between silvan elves and tribal humans - the humans I have in mind will be Native American-esque, very much in tune with their natural environment, but I'm finding it hard to distinguish them from silvan elves. The silvan elves I've got are going to be forest nomads with a modicum of iron-smithing ability (for arrows and blades, solely). The humans, conversely, will be primarily stone-age tech (with some ability to smelt gold and silver) with some savage gods. However, when I place it this way, there is little to distinguish the silvan elves from the high elves, who are going to be much more sedentary and advanced civilization. I really want each one to stand out on its own, but it seems like when I try to make silvan elves dissimilar to one group, it ends up driving them into the other camp. What have you all done in your own homebrew campaigns to differentiate the two? How have you all played the differing groups? 
2hksqb	-60162	1411777796	SagaEdition	Saga's wonky math and appropriate CL encounters	So my players have reached level 17. Up to this point, things were going pretty good. I had a solid collection of NPCs to fall back on should things roll to combat, but during our last encounter I found them lacking. The player's defenses and attack bonuses keep progressing, but I cannot make challenging NPCs for them without coming up with ridiculously hard min-maxed NPCs to counter them, which is both intensive and time-consuming. Simple nonheroics won't do it anymore; I've basically resorted to just using PC classes for them in order to keep things rolling, but with the exception of Force Using BBEG or their equivalents, that kind of effort and detail feels kind of overly intensive. I want stormtroopers to be a legitimate threat even at higher levels. How have you all kept combat challenging and interesting at higher levels???
2ii6k0	-60162	1412640774	DnD	Warlocks: do they have too few spell slots?	So I've been thinking about making a warlock character in 5th edition, but I've hit a bind - they have an extremely limited capability to cast spells. For those early levels, you are only generally casting 2 per combat, which I find very very limiting. Once those are discharged, then you basically have to fall back onto eldritch blast. It is especially annoying since they recharge on a short rest, which the book defines as a 1 hour rest without strenuous activity - idk about you guys, but in my group downtime in dungeons doesn't normally happen like that. Usually you are slogging your way from one combat to the other, or from one puzzle to the next. Am I perhaps reading the rules wrong? I think it would be much more fair if warlocks used their spell slots in the following manner: for each spell level, you have 2 spell slots. Because of the warlock's pact magic, those spells are maximized to the warlock's highest available spell slot level. An example 5th level warlock would have a get up as follows: 1st (2/short rest): 1 2 32nd (2/short rest): a b c3rd (2/short rest): x y zDoes this seem overpowered to you guys?

2kb83o	-60162	1414267378	totalwar	Divide and Conquer submod questions	Hello all! I've been playing the MOS submod for TATW recently, and after having played it for awhile I have some criticisms of it that. Specifically, I'd like to note if DaC addresses them, as if they do I'd like to make the change. I'd also like to know where I can find information on DaC units, other than just installing the DaC game itself. Bear in mind, I have very much enjoyed the MOS submod!1.) Elven units take too long to train and are too expensive. Yes, I realize that they are going to be "better" than their less longer-lived and practiced humanoid kin, but it is incredibly obnoxious to have to train even the base units over 2 turns. Their upkeep costs are also annoyingly expensive, though i could overlook that if initial recruitment was cheaper (or vice versa). This criticism extends to the dwarves as well, but to a lesser extent. How long does it take elven and dwarven factions to recruit their base units? Their advanced units? How expensive are they in comparison to other factions' units? 2.) It takes a ridiculously long time to travel anywhere in MOS. The lack of roads means that your troops are often left hiking in wilderness, and this slows expansion to a crawl. Correspondingly, your foes are left enough time to recoup their losses (especially if they are an evil faction). It makes blitzing (and being blitzed) next to impossible, and as either the dwarves or elves, it can take you 5 turns to get anywhere, which is annoying since it already took you 6+ turns to train a decently sized army (assuming its a higher tier city with high-tier buildings granting you access to multiple units, as the unit refresh times are huge and the number you can initially recruit are small). Does DaC allow for your troops to move greater distances?3.) The cultural requirement for troops is a bit annoying as well. While I understand and agree with the need to have a cultural requirement, without a priest/shaman unit to assist in spreading your culture it can take a very long time to convert a population over to your culture, and thus train more units. Are there priest agents in this game? Do the buildings compensate for their absence by having a high conversion rate? This sort of keys in to my next problem with unit recruitment, which is: 4.) It takes FOREVER for you to recruit units once you have a minimum cultural level met. Once I had the minimum 33% elven culture met (having already had the requisite barracks/archery range buildings in place) it takes a further 10-12 turns for the FIRST UNIT to show up as available for recruitment! I know, they want to make the elven and dwarven units stand out as highly skilled and tough in battle, versus the hordes of orc and goblin units that the other evil factions train. But those good factions are already suffering from slow recruitment times, high upkeep costs, and cultural requirements. The unit refreshment time for those factions is also very very slow. At the lowest tier buildings, you can only recruit one archer or axemen unit before waiting another gazillion turns to get another one. What are the unit refreshment rates like in this game? 
2lmufm	-60162	1415408648	ShingekiNoKyojin	Where can I get a scouting legion cape?	Not sure if this is the correct subreddit, but I don't really know of any others. I'm looking to get a Scouting Legion cape for a friend for christmas, and I was wondering if anyone knew of a high-quality vendor, or has bought one that is of high quality? 
2lzf4b	-60162	1415727412	DnD	The Deities and Demigods of Menevroth	I've decided to post the pantheon I'm using in my campaign here (The world of Menevroth), so that others can take a gander at it. It's not totally complete yet, I've still gotta do Moradin and work out some totem spirits for the wood elves, but this gives you the general idea.   Yazdanus (LG) – God of the soul, righteousness, fire, and lightGod of the spirit and light, Yazdanus is the equal and opposite brother to Tiamat. Yazdanus is worshipped by humans everywhere, and is an immensely popular deity. Anyone from the mightiest of kings to the humblest of farmers will invoke the Fire of Fires, and even amongst the non-human races his faith has garnered a great deal of respect. As he is a god of light and the soul, he (or at least his clergy) doesn’t permit any sort of iconography or image of him to be made, and his cathedrals often work around this simplicity by having soaring vaulted ceilings and stained glass windows, and an altar upon which a huge brazier burns. Yazdanus espouses to his followers a dogma of good thoughts, good speech, and good deeds, and wants them to act with moderation and justice. According to Yazdanite mythology, all other beings were created from the mixing of his light with Tiamat’s darkness; some of his most extreme followers have taken this to mean that Yazdanus is the only true god, as he alone was not befouled by Tiamat’s wickedness, though this view is not shared by the majority of even his own clergy. To these extremists, other deities or spirits are seen as false gods and nothing more than an idolatrous deception of Tiamat. Arcane magic is similarly frowned upon, and his worshippers everywhere are forbidden from its practice. Among his faith, the two most notable organizations are the Blazing Brand and Scarlet Hand. The Blazing Brand is an organization of paladins and clerics devoted to fighting the undead, notable for its zealous monotheism and desire to end the practice of arcane magic everywhere. The Scarlet Hand is an order of monks, who through fasting and meditation hope to kindle the Light of Yazdanus within themselves. His clerics may choose from the Light or Life domains. Tiamat (CE) – Goddess of primordial chaos, wealth, power, darkness, and wickedness Goddess of darkness and chaos, called the Mother of Monsters or Queen of Perdition, Tiamat is the equal and opposite sister to Yazdanus. Open worship of her is all-but forbidden by most civilized societies, though Orcs, Gnolls, and Dragons will worship her in some form or another. Among the civilized races, though, power-hungry warriors and bandits, corrupted spellcasters, merchants, and barbarians make up her devotees. Shrines to Tiamat are usually in long-forgotten caves, secret rooms or underground chambers, or deep in dangerous woodlands. They also commonly have an altar, upon which they sacrifice before an idol of her (usually a beast or serpent of some sort). Tiamat exhorts her followers to seek power and wealth by any means necessary, and to break the chains that they feel are holding them back. No methods are forbidden by her, and the ends always justify the means. Tiamat’s clergy commonly attempt to terrify mortals into placating her out of fear, and will attempt to murder the clergy of Yazdanus whenever they can. Her secret cult sites generally amass a great deal of wealth, and are often the location of grotesque and horrifying blood sacrifices, who are often cursed to become its foul sentinels in death. Interestingly, for a deity devoted to the pursuit of power, greed, and selfishness, she does not forbid her followers from worshipping other spirits or gods. Since Tiamat wants her followers to do whatever they can to achieve greatness, she therefore actively encourages her faithful to venerate or honor other beings if it means they can get ahead – a practice that some Yazdanists see as proof that all other gods are merely her deceptive creations. Clerics of Tiamat may choose the Trickery domain.  Ashera (CN) – Goddess of lust, love, revelry, beauty, and fertility Ashera is a wild yet mysterious goddess, whose festivals are notorious for their unbridled hedonism and whose neophytes must progress through a secretive series of initiations in order to gain higher station within the faith. The Tsagaach regard her as their ancestor, and so hold her in highest regard. Her orgiastic faith has not spread farther than Lashtar, where it is especially common amongst the rural folk. Temples to Ashera are usually located nearest to a city’s wine-presser (or house of prostitution), though festivals to her are normally celebrated away from larger towns and urban centers deep within forests or high up in the mountains. Ashera teaches that a free spirit and love are the very foundation of life, and that they simultaneously create, sustain, and destroy it. Her adherents hope that through the liberation of their spirit, an ecstatic and transcendent union with her can be achieved. To this end, her rituals and festivals are riotous events, full of potent wines and frenzied dancing. Ashera’s autumn and spring festivals are celebrated commonly among the Lashtari and Tsagaach, though secret rituals exist at other times of the year in which it is said select members of the cult, chosen by its leaders, receive commune with the goddess and receive her esoteric wisdom.    Tiwâz (CN) – God of war Menevroth’s foremost god of armed conflict and violence, Tiwâz is a mighty deity worshipped under many names or titles. Warriors, mercenaries, and kings are foremost in paying homage to him, and when battle is joined, his voice can be heard in the chorus of battle cries. He commands an immense deal of respect, and his clergy can often be found in the retinues of great hosts as field medics or company leaders. Though his temples are rare, the few that exist are mighty citadels scattered about in the wilderness. Tiwâz teaches his followers (who refer to themselves as “The Company”) that all warfare is deception, and that fortune favors the bold. His worshippers are to be fearless in battle, honorable in their conduct with enemy warriors and non-combatants, and above all to seek out ways to outmaneuver more powerful foes through trickery – the greater the disparity, the more glorious the victory! His church is notable for its sponsorship of adventuring companies, and his fortress-like monasteries are often very gracious hosts to adventurers and mercenaries. Should two disciples of Tiwâz meet on the battlefield, neither will refrain from trying to kill the other; dying by the hand of a brother of the faith is among the highest honor one can achieve. Clerics of Tiwâz may choose from the War or Trickery domains.  A’tar (LN) – Goddess of justice, oaths, and vengeance A’tar the Merciless is a stern and reserved goddess, terrible in her wrath but fair in her judgments. She hears all who swear oaths or bargains, and is regularly invoked by court officials or other such lawmakers. Those who desire revenge against people who’ve wronged them will also invoke her name, hoping that she will grant them the opportunity to see justice done. A’tar is especially popular among the Nar, who as a culture place a great deal of emphasis on loyalty and the bonds between individuals. Those who do not fulfill their oaths, or who seek to end them by foul means, earn her enmity, and as her title suggests she is not very forgiving. A’tar’s clergy frequently become involved in administrative or law-enforcement roles in larger settlements, and it is not unusual for guardhouses or prisons to have a small shrine to her. While she expects mortals to follow their laws meticulously (including hers; her cult rituals are notorious for their intricacy and drawn-out nature), her dogma is simple: be honest in your words, open in your dealings, follow the law, and avoid duplicitousness wherever you can. Clerics of A’tar may choose from the Death domain. Serena (CN) – Goddess of craftsmanship, discovery, inspiration, storms  Whenever craftsmen apply their work, mages research their spells, and scholars record the great deeds of their day, the goddess Serena is invoked. The Lady of Knowledge is often given a shrine in many libraries, and her chapels often function as a city’s archives or as places of prophecy. Her church is spread throughout Menevroth, though the emphasis it takes differs somewhat on where it is; in Lashtar, where arcane magic is prohibited, Serenite conclaves do not operate as repositories of arcane knowledge, instead focusing on prophecy and bookkeeping. Serena commands her faithful to work hard, to seek to surpass themselves and others, and to collect and disseminate knowledge however they can. Her favor often takes on the form of a frenzied delirium, in which all other elements of the world die away; the sudden and all-consuming nature of her feverish revelations has led to her associations with storms, and getting in the way of a Serenite’s obsession is correspondingly a good way to get pulverized. Her adherents can indeed be like leaves in a divine wind, buffeted about from one quest or vision to another with hardly a break in between. Clerics of Serena can choose from the Knowledge and Tempest domains.       Sabazios (CG) – God of fate, oracles and divination, the moon and stars, travelers and navigators, tradeFollowers of the god Sabazios are often merchants, fisherman, diviners, adventurers, or mercenaries. All who wander under the sky and seek solace at night may count the Guardian of Caravans as their protector. Sabazios’ temples are frequently in a prominent place such as a mountain or on a hill, with an oculus or some similar opening allowing the light of a full moon to fall upon the altar. Sabazios exhorts his worshippers to be hospitable to travelers, to be honest in trade, and to seek new horizons. Wisdom garnered by age and experience should be shared with all, and his clerics often act as doctors to the sick, hoping to ease their suffering and develop as a person from it. Priests and priestesses newly initiated into the faith must wander for an indefinite period of time, before returning to a temple to look after the laity.  For a few of these holy vagabonds however, the need to settle down is never felt, and so they spread the message of Sabazios throughout the world as they protect traveling merchants or offer healing to the needy. In the Lashtar city of Agoras is the largest temple to him anywhere, and it functions as an immensely popular (and profitable) oracle. Clerics of Sabazios may choose either the Knowledge or Life domains. The Four Archfey – Cernunnos, Yavanna, Oghma, and The Morrigan represent spring and the hunt, summer and storms, autumn and learning, and winter and warfare. The Four are typically served by warlocks, who swear an oath to a particular Archfey, so clerics are somewhat of a rarity. The High elves are a less reverent people than others, and so clerics among them are less common than they would among other peoples. The Archfey are truly powerful and terrifying beings worthy of great respect and fear, but the exile of the High Elves from the Otherworld has altered their relationship to The Four greatly. Whereas before their relationship was as one from a vassal to a lord, the high elves’ exile and fervent desire to return has now transformed it into a quasi-religious one. This altering of the power-dynamic has meant that the numbers of clerics are slowly rising, and they find themselves at odds with the nation’s warlocks and other arcane casters, who are traditionally used to being in positions of power and influence. These clerics are eager to prove their worth, however, and are more than willing to act as ambassadors or mercenaries if it means that they will prove their demigods’ power on Menevroth…and perhaps, earn a way back into the Otherworld while they’re at it. Clerics of the Four Archfey may choose from the Nature, Tempest, Knowledge, or War domains, but are granted spells collectively from The FourThe Three Virtues (NG) – Charity, Honor, TraditionThe Three Virtues is a philosophy which underpins the many cultures and societies of Turam, and is seen as embodied within the ruling family of Turam. In this way, it can be seen as a state-supported cult, though reverence for the three virtues is much older than the kingship of Turam and could likely continue just as well without it. Respect for this philosophy is the thread that binds together the many religious traditions and cults among the Turami; for example, a tribe may venerate or worship a lion spirit, and see within it the three virtues – the sharing of a kill (charity), the way in which males fight one another or protect their cubs (honor), and teaching their young to hunt (tradition). However, the association of a god or goddess with the three virtues may not necessarily be present. Some Turami do indeed venerate the philosophy on its own, a testament to its flexibility and ability to remain relevant. When worshipped as its own distinct entity, the Three Virtues are anthropomorphized into 3 beings: one with a jar overflowing with gold and wheat, another with a torch and shield, and the last with a book and staff. Clerics who choose to make the Three Virtues an important part of their faith, or the sole object of it, may choose from the Life, Light, or Knowledge domains.

2pfyiw	-60162	1418709244	SagaEdition	Vibroblades and Strength bonuses?	Hey there, just a quick question. I have a player who wishes to use the Blaster and Blade II talent from the Master Privateer class. He is wondering if there are any advanced melee weapons (specifically, vibroblades) which can be used to double their strength bonus. The problem is that vibroblades and vibrorapiers are small weapons, and so they don't get their strength bonus doubled when used two-handed, which seems to be necessary if you want to maximize Blaster and Blade II. We looked into vibroswords, but they are large weapons and so must be used two-handed. How have you guys ruled this? Is there errata about it that I'm missing? 
2s6qc3	-60162	1421085973	AskHistorians	How were chariots used effectively in ancient warfare? Why did they start to decline in importance as an element of warfare in the Classical period?	Hello there, first time poster here. How were chariots supposed to be used effectively in ancient times, such as in ancient Egypt, Babylon, Canaan, etc.? It seems like such a huge target for skirmishers to shoot and spearmen to take a whack at. Additionally, horses generally don't charge at walls, and it seems like they'd be even less inclined to pull a heavily laden cart towards a screaming morass of armed men. Such a large item, pulled by two horses and with a lot of moving parts, also seems like it would make chariot-archery a supremely difficult enterprise.

2tnock	-60162	1422224654	DnD	Werewolves, armor, and transformation rules	So I was reading through my 5e Monster Manual and I'm a bit confused as to what being a werewolf entails for players, other than the obvious turning into a bloodthirsty rage-machine at least once a month. Do players who transform while wearing armor break out of their armor and render it useless? The +1 to AC from natural armor is nice, but at higher levels I foresee the damage immunities as being useless because many enemies will have magic weapons (I'm specifically thinking devils, fey, etc.). The loss to AC is therefore a bit of a detriment as one gains levels. This might seem to be a somewhat of a "duh" question, but as a werewolf retains their medium size, I can foresee a player arguing from a RAW standpoint that they should be allowed to retain their armor bonus to AC.I'm also confused as to how transformations themselves are to work, specifically where it concerns how a player forces themselves to transform. If a player becomes cursed with lycanthropy in 3.5, they would have to make some kind of will save every time they were damaged to prevent transformations, and they could also make a will save to force themselves to transform. However, neither of these rules exist in RAW, so I'm curious to know how other players are handling it. I'm thinking DC Wis save = damage dealt. This will generally prevent them from transforming when they are dealt small amounts of damage, though large amounts of damage pose a more serious threat. I'd then require some kind of Wis Save = 8+# transformations made that day to retain their sanity and only attack their foes.  I've also decided to provide players who transform with a +2 bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution so long as they are in their wolf or hybrid form. This doesn't seem to mechanically game-breaking (it's only ever a bonus that's 1 higher than you will already have). This is much, much better than the static Str of 15 you get if you don't have higher than that strength already.Have you all used werewolves yet in 5e, or in some previous editions? How did you handle lycanthropy, and how did your players deal with it? 
2vualo	-60162	1423885896	swrpg	Need help with non-combat related encounters	Hello there everyone, I have gotten myself into a bit of a bind. I have been working on my campaign, and noticed that I have lots and lots of potential combat encounters in place while my group explores Felucia. My group generally tries to avoid combat (despite being stupefyingly good at it) though, and when they do engage in combat prefer to do it on their own terms. I'm entirely okay with this, as we've had some absolutely great non-combat related stuff before. However, I've sort of worked myself into a corner here, and I would really like for my party's stint on Felucia to not be one huge orgy of violence after another. They'll need a break. Can you all help me think up some ideas? My party consists of a protocol droid, a space pirate, and a Jawa. 
2ydzzh	-60162	1425859822	TrueAtheism	Argument from Personal Experience?	Hello there everyone, I have a quick question here about the argument from personal experience, especially where it concerns the feeling of love (or any other mental state really) and the feeling of god(s). Now, a person might argue that a person's feeling love is grounds to believe that love exists. Does it not seem reasonable then to assert that a person's feeling of the divine is therefore grounds for believing that the divine exists? In essence, it's "You feel love, and so believe love is real; I feel God, and so believe God is real." I've perhaps detected a flaw in the argument here, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on it before I spill the beans. I don't want to subconsciously shape any responses to this argument into running along only 1 response; ideally, I'd like to see if there are multiple things wrong with this line of argumentation, if at all.So then, do you find this argument reasonable? If not, what flaws can you find in it?Cheers for those of you who take the time to answer my question :) This sub does a pretty good job about keeping things a little more dispassionate than our parent sub.
2yzhly	-60162	1426303865	DnD	What do devil-worshiping cults believe?	Hello all, I'm trying to construct a devil-worshiping cult for my homebrew, and I'm trying to figure out just what they are supposed to believe. Essentially, it boils down to problems of alignment and how to fit that into their beliefs. Devils are commonly described as Lawful Evil. From what I've been able to glean, lawful evil people commonly believe that laws exist to elevate the strong and cunning to positions of power over others, and that one's place in the social hierarchy should depend on one's personal ability. However, evil people are looking out for number 1 and are usually willing to do whatever it takes to get ahead, and that includes killing or double-crossing close allies if they think it'll help them. However, how does ANY of that appeal to your common person in a city with generally stable government? A total willingness to crush rivals seems at odds (at least for lay-people) to the strong respect for authority and bargaining that devils are known for. The stereotypical devil-cult in our views is one of sin and debauchery, usually portrayed as "the traditional mores of society are holding you and everyone else back, etc." - yet this doesn't seem to jive with the portrayal of devils in DnD as agents of the ultimate infernal dictatorship. Dictatorships are known for punishing crimes (be they crimes against the state, or crimes against other people) in a very harsh manner, yet the stereotypical "free yourself from society's chains" and "do what you can to get ahead" don't seem like they fit well into that sort of political paradigm. Those two ideas seem to fit in more with the Chaotic Evil alignment than with Lawful Evil. Perhaps I am overthinking how it works? I'm willing to simplify it somewhat down to those 2 aforementioned stereotypes, in which case my only real concern is "how and why do a bunch of grade-A backstabbing assholes work together AT ALL?" Thank you for any replies and help you may provide :) You guys are the reason this is my favorite sub!
30c85c	-60162	1427344080	EDH	Viability of burn in EDH? Trying to use Keranos	Hello all. I'm considering revamping my Niv-Mizzet to become Keranos. I'd like the change in play-style, and Keranos seems to be less obviously threatening to other players at the table. I'm still going to be using the standard degenerate combos available to UR (Kiki-Jiki+ Pestermite, etc.), but I'd rather not play stax builds I've seen with him with the whole table, especially since I've already got a Daretti built.I would like to stack it with burn. Is that a useful way to go? In your experience, would your average 2 or 3 damage burn spell be relevant in a game of EDH? For what it's worth, my playgroup sees a lot of Green. I don't play nearly enough now to know exactly, and I thought the community here as a whole might know more. Burn spells and scry spells would work well with Guttersnipe, Talrand, Psych Crawler, and Sphinx-bone wand as alternate win-cons. 
37lru8	-60162	1432827158	DnD	A question abou sorcerer metamagic and Concentration spells	Hi there everyone. I have a potential player who is interested in playing a sorcerer that wants to twincast a lot of his spells. Unfortunately, a lot of the really nifty spells that would be fun to twincast (like Witch Bolt or Enhance Ability) require concentration, and you can only have concentration going for one spell at a time. Now, being able to maintain concentration on more than one spell seems like a powerful boost that would really give the Sorcerer an advantage over the far more versatile wizard, but is it TOO much of an advantage? Have any of you tested this concept before, and if so, what were your results or conclusions?Thank you for any help you can provide!

I'm trying to make the devils seem more Efreet-like for an Arabian-nights themed 5e homebrew campaign, but I'm a little confused as to how I should go about it. I'm concerned that by changing things to the devils, I will alter their Challenge Level excessively. A lot of the changes will simply be cosmetic (they can fly, etc), and some of them I don't need to change at all - Barbed Devil and Bone Devil among them. A lot of the devil's "roles" will be preserved (Barbed devils are guards, Chain devils torturers, etc.), but what role exactly will something like the Efreet from the MM have??? It's such a unique and flavorful monster that it seems a waste to just ignore it or not use it somehow. What say you all?

After my players' current escapades end, I want them to go to Teth and visit the B'omarr Monastery there.

They are ultimately trying to put together a privateering crew, with one member being a deserter, another a mechanic, and the last a droid working for a senator. What would bring such a disparate and self-interested group to a peaceful monastery like Teth's??? What reason would the monks, or somebody else inside, have to murder someone for that matter?

3dciqb	-60162	1436936526	SagaEdition	Re-doing the Lightsaber Form talents - homebrew!	Hello there everyone. I have for awhile thought that the Lightsaber Form talents (Ataru, Soresu, Djem So, etc.) are rather lackluster, in that they don't adequately reflect the advantages and disadvantages of the style being used. I have re-tooled the talents, so that they now feel more robust and accurate when considering Legends canon. Activating each of these styles is a swift action, which I feel reflects the need to get into the proper mindset or ready one's stance/attack sequence. A player can end using any of these styles as a free action on their turn. My playgroup uses the Advantage/Disadvantage system from DnD 5e because it simplifies a lot of math, but wherever "disadvantage" occurs here it can be replaced by a simple -5 penalty for those of you who prefer to use RAW. "Advantage" where it occurs should actually identical between between 5e and Saga Edition, so it needs little changing, if at all. I have tried to keep the talents as close to their RAW form as I could, though I have added prerequisites where I felt they were necessary. **Form I/Shii-Cho**: you gain +1 Reflex for every attack made against you since the end of your last turn (autofire attacks count, grenades etc. do not). You also gain a +2 bonus to disarm attempts. (Prerequisites – Block, Deflect)**Form II/Makashi**: when wielding a lightsaber one-handed, your deflection bonus from Lightsaber Defense  against melee attacks increases by +2, and you gain +1 attack against enemies engaging you in melee combat. However, you have disadvantage on all Use the Force checks to use the Deflect talent. (Prerequisite – Block, Lightsaber Defense)**Form III/Soresu**: you have advantage on all Block and Deflect checks, but you take a -2 penalty on all attacks. (Prerequisite – Block, Deflect)**Form IV/Ataru**: you may apply your dexterity modifier to damage, and may double it if using the lightsaber 2-handed. After 3 rounds, and every round thereafter, make a DC 15 Endurance check; if you fail, you move -1 step down the Condition Track. The DC increases by 2 each round. (Prerequisite – proficient in Acrobatics skill, Acrobatic Strike, Martial Arts I)**Form V/Djem So**: if you are hit by a melee attack, you may spend a force point to make an immediate attack roll against the target. However, using this style means that one halves their movement speed. (Prerequisite – Block, Mighty Swing)**Form V/Shien**: you gain a +5 bonus on all Redirect Shot attack rolls. However, you have -2 Reflex against those engaging you in melee. (Prerequisite – Deflect, Redirect Shot)**Form VI/Niman**: you gain +1 Ref and +1 Will while wielding your lightsaber. You may substitute an extra attack from the Double Attack or Triple Attack feat for a Use the Force check to activate a Force power with the [telekinetic] descriptor. Use of the the Force power Move Object will not draw attacks of opportunity. **Form VII/Juyo**: at the beginning of an encounter when you activate this style, spend a Force Point; you gain advantage on your first lightsaber attack against a single chosen target each round until the end of the encounter, as well as +1 Reflex and +1 Fortitude. However, you must also at the beginning of combat make a Wisdom saving throw with DC = 10 + your dark side score. If you fail, you draw upon the dark side and increase your dark side score by 1. You have disadvantage on this roll if you have used a Force power with the [Dark Side] descriptor. Additionally, all Force Powers targeting you receive a +2 bonus. (Prerequisites – Weapon Focus (lightsabers), Weapon Specialization (lightsabers), B.A.B. +10)**Form VII/Vaapad**: you score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 while wielding a lightsaber and using the Juyo style. Additionally, you eliminate the bonus enemies receive when targeting you with Force powers, and also receive a +2 bonus to defenses when targeted by Force powers with the [Dark Side] descriptor. (Prerequisites – Juyo, Weapon Focus (lightsabers), Weapon Specialization (lightsabers), B.A.B. +12)**Jar'Kai**: you double your bonus from Lightsaber Defense and can activate Lightsaber Defense as a free action so long as you are wielding two lightsabers. However, you take a -5 penalty on all Use the Force checks to activate a power with the [Telekinetic] descriptor. (Prerequisites – Dual Weapon Fighting I, Lightsaber Defense, Niman)I'm interested to see what you guys think of it, and I hope that I've balanced it out well enough. Shii-Cho may take a bit more work, though it's weak against single targets (according to Legends) and I feel the very minimal Reflex bump that you would get from it reflects that. My greatest concern is where it concerns how many styles a player could potentially use at once. In-universe, a master swordsman could mix and match styles as the situation warranted, and the feats are supposed to represent this training to a certain extent. Not using one of the talents would also certainly reflect your average Jedi falling back upon a combination of routines or katas that fit the situation better than a specific style's approach, with feats showing this and providing additional flavor. However, what's to stop someone from integrating Juyo's frenzy into their Ataru acrobatics? What stops a Jedi from mixing Makashi's precision with Jar'Kai? Lore-wise it doesn't make too much sense, but I worry very much about the mechanical aspects of it in-game. Non-Jedi melee builds are viable and can indeed be deadly threats against them (regardless of whether or not it makes sense lore-wise), but Force powers like Dark Rage and Battle Strike give them a dangerous edge, and I'm wary of tipping that balance too far in favor of Jedi and Sith.

19sa34	-60174	1362590876	html5	Why use HTML5 when so many people are still on browsers that don't support it?	I'm about to enter the job market and I'm brushing up on various Java, Javascript, JQuery and HTML skills.  I've read about HTML5 and it sounds great, but I'm not convinced that the world is ready for it yet.  Am I wrong?  If I develop a public web app that is dependent on HTML5 features, what percentage of the folks in the U.S. will be able to use it on their laptop or desktop with their current browsers?  If I develop an app for a Federal agency, what are the chances they will he using modern browsers/versions (slim)? Do you expect to convince folks to upgrade their browser when they hit your site? It just seems like I might be better off waiting a year or two to really get into HTML5.  I could use up plenty of my time learning jquery and other things without bothering with HTML5 yet.   Please let me know your thoughts.  Maybe Android and iOS browsers are the only solid market for HTML5 right now? Thanks in advance for any advice you can give me.
19soq5	-60174	1362601984	jquery	When developing an HTML5 app, what would be the main use of jQuery? 	I'm trying to get my head around the potential overlap vs. the complementary qualities of the two.  I see that HTML5 has document.querySelector() to grab DOM elements which is one of the main purposes of jQuery.  HTML5 is packed with new features that were harder or impossible with HTML4.  Does jQuery become less important with HTML5?  I'm sure it still has a great body of useful API and plugins, but is it more of a nice-to-have now?  Please help me understand how the two things fit together and how an app might be structured to take advantage of both HTML5 and jQuery.
19x9g5	-60174	1362766075	java	Is the Spring Framework still relevant? 	It seems like a lot of the buz in Java / J EE world right now involves rich javascript applications in the browser connecting to Java applications on the server rather than the old servlet oriented MVC approach.  There are a lot of RESTful services talking JSON to the browser.  It also seems that the official J EE standard now incorporates some of the injection and other things that Spring gave us.  So, is Spring still relevant for new development?  I'm brushing up skills to re-enter the job market.  I have experience with Java / J EE including most recently JSF and Portlets.  Rather than refreshing my skills with JSF and Portlets, I want to take this opportunity to get into something new that will be highly marketable for the coming years.  I'm thinking J EE 6, with emphasis on JQuery, HTML5, RESTful Services, JSON, and Hibernate.  But what about Spring?  I've never used Spring or Hibernate (or JQuery or HTML5 or RESTful services).  Is Spring still relevant?

In the Washington DC area where i live, good senior developers usually make around $80 to $100 per hour as contractors.

I'm talking about a site that just allows you to enter in your income, your budgetary goals, etc and it helps you with your planning.

That's it.  Is it ok if it uses http and not https?  It uses oAuth for folks what want to use their facebook login etc.  It has a captcha.  It has hashed password storage for accounts that are not using oAuth.  The site is hosted on AWS so it has the build in security of their linux instances and DynamoDB etc.  It has a single app ID access to the database.  It has Servlet filter technology to check authorization for all user requests that could read or modify data.   Would this hold up as a normal, acceptable level of security for a commercial client that the site is built for?

I can see why monasteries are able to function in that sort of Zen "mindset".  But what about someone who needs to stay intensely involved in a career such as a corporate job or cut-throat entrepreneurial or professional environment?  Have some of you worked through the reconciliation of these things and have some ideas to share?  Yes, i know "before enlightenment, carry water and chop wood, after enlightenment carry water and chop wood".  But surely you can understand my point that some of the four noble truths or the eight fold path may take awhile for a beginning Zen practitioner to work out.  For example, you can be sure that putting a competitor out of business might entail hurting a "sentient being".  And there are a lot of professions where "harsh speech" comes with the territory (think of lawyers and cops).  Generally, feeling at peace with the ups and downs of a professional or business job could make it hard to stay on top of your game.  You almost need to suffer from the stress and emotion.  And how can you live in each moment without dwelling on the past and future when you are the CEO of a technology company?  Please bare with me as I'm just getting into learning about Zen.  Your feedback is appreciated.

1t17j9	-60174	1387226924	DebateReligion	To not scrutinize the bible and relentlessly ask the hard questions is disrespectful of Jesus.	Come on people.  Billions of people have unquestioningly taken the bible at face value like detached, disinterested, sheep-like beings.  The bible was written thousands of years ago by primitive desert people who never met anyone who met anyone who met Jesus. These people believed in demons and witchcraft.  They thought the world was flat.  They thought women were subordinate.  To not ask the hard questions on the bible is disrespectful of Jesus in my humble opinion.  For the core of Jesus' positive teachings that tell us to love our neighbors and help poor and do unto others as we'd have them do unto us - all that can be reinforced by what you feel in you heart.  But most of the rest of the bible should be fervently scrutinized and debated.  People are afraid to question the bible because of man-made fear.  The bible was written by men (and designed to make people afraid to question it). If Jesus was God do you think he would want you to blindly accept everything that was written about him? Did he say that the bible was all legit? No ... he was long gone when the bible was written by MEN.  If you really believe in judgement day and the likes, I think you should be more afraid of just blindly following the word of MEN from the bible than anything else.

The kit will be for home studio and maybe small bar /cafe gigs. I like the idea of something that doesn't take up a lot of space in the tiny studio i have at home and that is also easy to pack up and move to and from a friend's house or a small cafe/bar gig. Does such a thing exist that also has a high quality sound?

In the initial setup i opted for everything from my old MacBook Pro to be transferred from time capsule to the new MacBook.  Since it went over night and still had 80 hours left ... i went ahead and stopped it.  The way i did that was to just force power off.  My question is:  Did everything in that transfer get un-done so i don't have to worry about cleaning anything up from that partial transfer?  After booting up again i was taken through the normal setup and opted out of transferring anything from time capsule etc.  I'll just manually move some key data over instead of doing a complete transfer of old system to new.

26lsz9	-60174	1401199105	Brooklyn	Visiting Brooklyn to try and sell the wife on moving to there. Where should we stay and where should we walk around?	We currently live in Arlington, Virginia just outside of D.C.  We have two small children.  If we move to Brooklyn we might spend $1.5M to $2M on a townhouse, but initially we would probably just rent a house or appartment for a year or two.  We're visiting Brooklyn for two or three nights in July and would like to stay in a high-end hotel or bed-and-breakfeast and enjoy a mini-vacation without the kiddos.  I've heard that Park Slope may be a good place to start because there are a lot of young families and a great large park (my wife and kids love parks).  So our criteria are:  safety, good schools, good parks, lots of young families, nice dining and shopping, art and culture, etc.  Nice access to the subway would be a plus too.  Thanks in advance for any suggestions you have.

My wife also has sexual side effects from her Prozac.  I suffer from ruminative thinking which the Lexapro doesn't seem to be helping with.  We've heard good things about Viibryd and it seems logical that the sort of dual action of the drug could be very beneficial for both us us.  I would love to hear some feedback from others who have made such a switch.

I am impressed with the momentum and the advancements of JavaScript with things like HTML5 and AngularJS.

I'll still try to hold on to the Java / JEE skills too, but i'll probably be mostly focussed on my new discipline.  Just curious as to what some of you think about such a move and whether you have some lessons-learned / success stories / interesting stories about such a transition.

2boykt	-60174	1406297796	java	Is JavaScript / HTML5 development going to surpass Java / JEE as an enterprise platform for development?	Does it behoove Java Developers to re-focus some of their skill development to JavaScript and frameworks like AngularJS and to plan to gradually move on from Java?  It seems like JavaScript / HTML5 is where the momentum is.  Even the J EE spec seems to be embracing this with Java EE 7 introducing API for WebSockets and JSON and other HTML5 / JavaScript technologies.  I know there will be a great supply of Java jobs for many years to come, but do you get a sense that JavaScript / HTML5 is emerging as a big part of the future where a strings like JSF and Swing are going to phase out?  Not to mention node.js seems to be taking off too for server side development ...

2dzoxi	-60174	1408463080	java	I have questions about Java / Java EE development with NoSQL databases.	1.)Are java developers finding that NoSQL database experience is required more and more and that it may surpass SQL database experience in the job market?2.)Does Java EE 7 (JPA etc) accomodate NoSQL databases or is it pretty much still geared towards SQL databases?  I know you can create your own classes within a Java EE module to to connect to NoSQL etc ... but its not really part of the standard right?  Do NoSQL databases fit into the Java EE model of having the app server managing the connection pool and the dependency injection etc?3.)Does the available tooling that Java developers use have good support for NoSQL?  I love how I can use NetBeans to automatically generate entity classes for an existing SQL database.  But I can't do that with something like MongoDB can i?  So is tooling still generally more geared towards SQL databases?4.)Is the Spring framework more accommodating for NoSQL databases than Java EE 7?

2jsv33	-60174	1413825612	javascript	Writing code to test code doesn't make sense to me.	I've been playing with some javascript testing tools like Jasmine and I just don't get it.  Why would you add more custom code to your project in order to test your code?  Its just more code to manage.  Every time my app code changes, i have to work on my test code again.  Adding test code to your project means more code to manage and the amount of code overall increases which surely means more bugs.  I think that wherever possible, testing end-to-end by actually using your app UI is going to be more efficient.  I've been spending all morning trying to debug an issue with a Jasmine test.  And that's an issue i know of.  I wonder if people end up with false-positive and false-negative test results due to bugs in their test code that they don't know of or understand.  Please help me see the light.

2jx7xf	-60174	1413922890	webdev	Why do you choose to be a Web developer instead of some other type of developer?	Why aren't you a backend developer or an android developer or an objective-c / cocoa developer?  Is it based on personal preference or is it based on your idea of marketability or did you just sort of fall into web development because of certain jobs you had?  If you chose Web development as a preference, could you share some of the reasons why?  I have experience as a Java developer including desktop (Java Swing years ago) and web (JSP, JSF, Portliest, HTML etc) as well as some backend.  I am currently learning JavaScript/HTML5 and AngularJS because i see a lot of momentum with those things and i like the cross-platform idea.  But sometimes i wonder if i should get out of the highly fragmented, confusing and convoluted Web platform (and the browser / server complexities) and go with something more controlled and sandboxed like iOS or Android (i know, Android is fragmented too ... but its not the same).  I'm just interested in your own thought process.  Do you actually love the Web platform and why?

2l9c6c	-60174	1415108075	java	Should i do a masters in IT? I have a lot of experience as a Java Developer ...	My undergraduate degree was in Biochemistry (class of 1997), but I taught myself Java programming in 1999 and now have over 14 years of experience as a developer.  Some of those years were spent doing very little coding (i own a successful consulting company with a lot of employees doing enterprise app dev for the Federal government and some large corporations).  Eventually I will go back to just being a full-time developer because that's what I enjoy.  I am interested in possibly doing a masters degree in IT with a software engineer track.  I think i would enjoy being back in school, and the degree would give me a sense of accomplishment and perhaps fill a void since I have a career in a field in which i have no formal schooling.  But is it too late?  Can such a masters degree really teach me anything i don't know? Can it boost my marketability as a developer? I'm concerned that academia may lag behind industry by too much.  Lately i've been teaching myself HTML5, AngularJS, Java EE 7 and Agile methodology.  I doubt the technologies in most masters programs are as modern as those things.  But does it matter?  Would it be a fulfilling and worthwhile endeavor anyway?  What do you think would be the pros and cons for me doing a masters degree at this point?  In particular, i am looking at this program at my alma mater, Virginia Tech:  http://www.vtmit.vt.edu

Its the same thing as servlets which we have been using since the stone age.	edit: I understand that REST is about an architectural pattern, and not an specific implementation like servlets. My point is just that apps in the 2001 timeframe that were using servlets to serve results using http methods were basically RESTful services. REST is an architectural pattern that describes something we've always done. It seems like it gets a lot of hype as a replacement for SOAP etc, but like many things in IT ... its just recycling of old technologies or patterns with new branding. In a way, RESTFul services with jax-rs etc is really just a reversion back to the same thing offered by servlets. For most people, and for all intents and purposes, REST basically means web services that are not SOAP (i.e. web services like we used to do them before the XML revolution). I think that a lot of what people are really enjoying with "REST" is that it tends to be associated with JSON which is a lot nicer to work with than XML (but one can enjoy the benefits of JSON without ever even knowing what REST is).

I don't have time right now for both!  I've got some experience with core java and a little bit of older Java EE versions, but i haven't worked with Spring or with recent versions of Java EE.  I know that Java EE 7 is thought to be a really nice framework and it includes technologies from open-source influences like Spring and that some folks are moving away from Spring and over to Java EE now.  If I do go with Java EE 7, which app server should i learn with?  Glassfish?  Or is there a more production ready server like Wildly perhaps that would be a more marketable skill?

I have to say that these practices of relaxation and mental pacification have been transformative for me.  I can now drink moderately and socially and I am a much happier person.  I just thought I would share in case others are looking for ideas.  Yoga and meditation are really therapeutic and can be enough for some people to to reform themselves.  Of course I know there are some people who should never drink again, but there are some people who just need to be reformed and healed before trying to drink moderately.  I still practice Yoga and meditation and I find that i have healthy, wholesome relief from the feelings and conditioning that used to drive me to medicate with alcohol etc.

For an example, my friend and I recently bought Dominion, and he is insistent on buying all the expansions (We already have prosperity), whereas I want to buy new games (just ordered TTR, Love Letter and The Resistance).

I realized that many of our games are light to mid/light, and i'm looking to try something a little heavier. Current games in the collection are:    * Catan + every expansion (Easily turns from gateway to pretty advanced with some expansions)  * Catan:... Ancient Egypt, Star Trek, Merchants of Europe, America: Trails to Rails, and Of the Stone Age  * 7 Wonders (although we haven't played yet)  * Boss Monster (Haven't played that either)  * ZOMBIES!!! + Jailbreak expansion  * Citadels  * Dominion + Prosperity (loving it)  * Small World Underground  edit: forgot to add, I have Love Letter, Ticket to Ride and The Resistance coming in the mail
31xadb	-60188	1428529694	boardgames	Organizing my first game night	I'm organizing a game night with some friends for Friday (I wanted Saturday, I don't know why they are saying Friday). If everything works out we will have 6 players. We are all 15-17 years old, two of us are very "fluent" in board games, two are mediocre, and two are absolute beginners (Played a game of ZOMBIES!!! with one of them). I'm looking for suggestions on what to play and in what order. Right now I'm thinking start with **The Resistance**, then **Ticket to ride** (Does that take 6?), then **7 Wonders**, **Citadels**, and maybe base **Catan** with the 5-6 player expansion. If we have time, I might want to add **Elder Sign**. What do you guys think?    Games in the collection:  **The Resistance  Citadels  Boss Monster  Dominion** + **Prosperity  7 Wonders  Catan** + Every Standalone and expansion, and the 5-6 base  **Risk** + **LotR Risk  Small World: Underground  ZOMBIES!!!** + **Jailbreak** expansion  **Munchkin** + every expansion  **Elder Sign**  **Ticket to Ride  Love Letter L5R edition**  Maybe **Star Realms**, I got it from humble, not sure when it's coming    I might be missing one or two that are at my friend's house.Edit: Group of six is now two groups of four on two days

33jr6f	-60188	1429754651	TheChurchOfRogers	Looking for help to have a neighborly "break up" with my ex-best friend	Hello neighbors, I hope you are all very well. Recently I've been going through a "break up" with a very close friend, and I've realized I haven't been acting very neighborly. For context, I am in grade 10, 15 years old and so is my previous friend. We cut it off together, we had a fight and I didn't like the way he was acting, and I had been realizing around that time that I didn't really want to be friends with him anyway, as I really don't like him. We haven't really been talking for the past two weeks and I just realized that I have been saying mean things about him to other people. I want to know how to have a more neighborly break up with him. One problem I'm facing is that there used to be three of us, all best friends, and the other friend is still friends with him, and he is my best friend. The ex friend is also friends with a lot of my friends and it makes it hard to maintain relationships with them. Do you have any advice on how to take this situation? Sorry if this is confusing, thanks in advance for your help.

3cr17f	-60188	1436494309	DebateCommunism	Just some ideas from a new marxist, can you critique me?	   So I'm still new to Marxism in general, but I am learning. I thought I would put my ideas of what I think would be ideal here for some critique. These ideas are probably not unique, and might even have a term associated with them but I'll put them here anyway.     I think that the ideal end result should be anarcho-communism, as Marx said: a classless **stateless** society, but I realize this can't happen automatically. Because of this I think we need to have the DotP for enough time after a revolution, or if possible, a democratic revision, that the customs and ideas of a classless society fade. After the counter revolutions have mostly faded we can abolish the DotP and set up complete direct democracy.     Now I also think that for this to work it has to either start in or quickly spread to the people of the United States, as they are the primary reactionary force in the world, and will use their immense military power to destroy the revolution before it even has a chance to finish.

1v5s55	-60229	1389667569	DotA2	Can I Get Advice on My Invoker?	Hi guys. Can someone help me with my Invoker? I have nine games with so far at 44% win rate and 2.48 KD (http://dotabuff.com/players/144400391 full link here).My first two games I stomped both wins and with a combined 9.00 KD. But since then, I've doing bad and I want to know what I'm doing wrong. Skills:I go the 4-1-4 Invoker trying to get double forge spirits. I start with E, then invoke. I get Invoke at 7, Wex at like 8+ (depending on the situation) and try to get Quas and Exort at 4 by like level 11. Then I prioritize Exort, Wex, and Quas in that order getting Invoke always.Items:I start 3 branches, Tango, Circlet, and Salve. I then get boots soon and get them into Arcane. Then I rush Aghan Scepter. Then I get Eul's. Most games end by then, but I like to start for Scythe at that point.My biggest issue is lane control. I try to play very safe and just last hit, but then I get pushed in by enemies like this one Dragon Knight who would push to my tower with his dragon breath. Then he went to go gank/collect runes with his bottle.So, I'm asking if anyone will be kind enough to help me with skill, item, and general play style with Invoker. Thanks :)
1vjao7	-60229	1390068905	DotA2	Is This a Good Invoker Build?	Hello, everyone. I'm asking on your opinions on this Invoker build that I want try out.Skills:Max Exort. From levels 1-7:E, R, Q, E, E, W, EFrom there, max Exort as soon as possible, take Invoke whenever possible, bring Quas up to level 4, max out Wex, max out Quas.Items:Blades + Tango start -&gt;Bracer (into Drums later on) -&gt;Phase Boots -&gt;Eul's Scepter -&gt;Rod of Atos -&gt;Aghanim's Scepter -&gt;Force Staff -&gt;Situational/Luxury (Scythe, Blink, Refreshor)So, what do you think of this build? A few questions I have:- Is Bracer good on Invoker? I want to bulk myself up early game especially because I am not getting a lot of Quas. - Is Rod of Atos good on Invoker? The health is nice, the intelligence offers bonus mana, regen, and damage. The CC active also works well with other Invoker's spells like Sunstrike, Metoer, more attacks from Forge Spirits.- Tango or Salve for start? I thought Tango because it lets you regen more times- Should I get Bottle? I see a few videos with the mids getting Bottle for runes. Thank you for all your help. :)
1wf1lv	-60229	1390954098	DotA2	Does it Still Count as a Loss When You Abandon a Safe-to-Leave Game?	Hello, everyone. I just recently played a game where two of my teammates left around the 20 minute mark. We were already losing by then so I just left the game after it was safe to leave. But, when I checked out my match history right now on Dotabuff, it counts it as a loss. I'm confused, doesn't another person's abandon make it a forgiven loss? Also, I saw that I did not receive any Battle Points after I quit, either.So, I was hoping if someone can give the specifics of Safe to Abandon? Like, is it always a loss, or only if I quit? Would I have gotten Battle Points if I finished the game? Thank you.
1wfc12	-60229	1390959980	DotA2	How Should Each of These Heroes Deal with Terrorblade?	Hi guys. Terrorblade is going to be released in a few days and I was wondering on some general strategies each of my favorite heroes can take to fight Terrorblade. I don't want to get crushed under the Terrorblade FotM.Here are my favorite heroes:Bane- I would try to Enfeeble and Nightmare TB, trying to stall him out until I can get some help (this would be in the later stages of the game, btw).  think Brain Sap would work great against TB ult if saved for post-ult (can restore some of the health lost) and Fiend's Grip to CC TB when he gets low.Invoker- Try to duel with Alacrity and Forge Spirits. Then, burst TB down with a combination of Tornado, Sunstrike, Meteor, and Blast if you can fit all of that in.Enigma- I think Enigma would just try to duel catch TB in a teamfight when possible. Enigma kind of screwed in a 1v1 with TBZeus- Zeus can certainly nuke at all stages of the game, but I don't see any way that Zeus can stop a TB ult. And, at that point, Zeus would be screwed.So, how would you play these heroes against Terrorblade in a mid-late game setting when he starts to become strong? Also, what lane would TB most likely be in and what items would work well against TB? Thank you.

Should I evenly upgrade all of my temples of max each one at a time? 3. How much of my prestige should come from Orders? Right now, I am at 6300 Prestige and the summary page says 400 from temples and 300 from chapels. If these numbers are too low, should I start farming for holy texts instead of sparks when I can?
3hzxxh	-60229	1440270579	Skyforge	Some Quick Questions	Hi guys, I just had a few quick questions.1. Some times in the Divine Observatory certain missions will be highlighted and sticking out from the globe. These missions are usually x2 or x3. But I noticed that even after 40 minutes those bonus missions keep their bonus (but they might change rewards). For example, I looked at Thai's Temple today. At first it was a x2 Green Sparks, then a x2 Adept Gold Coins (forget the name), and finally a x2 Blue Sparks mission in 3 consecutive 40-minute cycles. I am wondering why that happens? 2. I have noticed since the last week that I seem to be getting less x3 bonus missions. Is it just my perception? Is there any way to make x3 missions appear more often for oneself?3. I unlocked the Witch/Warlock today! It's exciting but now I am kind of lost on what to do in the main Ascension Atlas. I have Necro already and now Witch and I am wondering what talents I should get for them until I decide what class to go for next. What are some good talents/nodes to unlock in the main Atlas?4. Whats the best way to get Credits? I am running a little low on money. I found that the backpack awarded from Big Battles gives out Ether Cores and selling those Ether Cores gets a nice lump of money. Is there a better, more efficient way to quickly get Credits?

In the last year - I've ruined relationships and been fired from jobs as I simply manage to go on benders. Been let go of last week from most recent job and am simply sick of this, relationships burnt, money spent and just not being able to stop once I've had one drink.Can anyone suggest some good books to read? Im going to be by myself as hey Im not working anymore so going to give this 100%.I've figured a morning routine -  I'm going to go to the gym and have myself a good amount of movies to entertain myself with. It's the what else do I need to do part? All this sudden amount of time to myself seems daunting. Been considering AA - I don't feel comfortable saying the I'm new bit etc- can I just go into a meeting and say nothing?Any advice much welcomed.

32xtbo	-60276	1429288512	moto360	I just had a mini heart attack	This literally just happened and my heart is still racing. I just left second period and had to walk up the stairs to get to my next class. There were quite a few people so I had to stay to the right side of the stairs. I got a little too close to the railing and felt my watch scratch against the side. The watch and the railing made the worst grinding noise and my heart dropped. I quickly lifted my watch to assess the damage. I feared the worst. I had bought this watch from my own pocket and being a poor high school student, the watch was a large investment for me. I've never damaged a device I've owned, and a scratch or crack would have been horrible. At this point I realized I couldn't wait any longer and lifted my watch to see what I had done.I scratched the paint off the railing with my watch.

2181ow	-60290	1395661513	htc	My HTC One has a very weird issue! Can someone help me out?	Alright, the issue is that my HTC one (a phone I dearly love) refuses to turn on anymore even though it seems it is charging. In India, the country that I live, HTC's service is quite poor. On the way to the service center, unfortunately in an incident the gorilla glass broke.HTC's service center refused to take the phone under warranty quoting that if there is any physical damage to the phone, the warranty is void. I tried explaining them the bigger issue was my phone not turning on but to no avail. Now, I am here on reddit in hope of finding a DIY fix for my phone. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_Nll_01jG0 (I found a video on Youtube which explains the same issue I am facing, all though I don't have access to WD-40 or this magic potion.)

For example, if one replaces Frank's organ with a machine which does the exact same function, does it cause any change in Frank's behaviour/thinking process? Do these cells have any kind of indirect impact on the functionality of Frank's brain, because certain emotional changes impact certain organs, fear causes the heart and the lungs to work harder. Is the corollary possible? Can it be that Frank's overall behaviour keeps changing as and when his doctor replaces his organs with machines? Hope I've explained my thoughts clearly!

1d81w6	-60306	1367082112	StackAdvice	Alternatives to nicotine for anxiety/mood?	I have experienced the anxiolytic effects of nicotine for the past few years and it's not until I quit that my social/general anxiety rears its ugly head and spirals me into a rut. After quitting/relapsing several times it appears that nicotine is almost unmatched in providing the optimal balance of anxiety reduction and stimulation. In the meantime I have resigned myself to smoking until my condition is under control but was wondering if - in the interests of a healthy lifestyle - there any alternatives which can provide similar effects on cognition/mood/memory/verbal fluidity? Or should I be switching to e-cigs + exercise? Snuff? Perhaps a racetam or other high energy noot? What are the implications of the MAOI in cigarettes on mood, as separate from the nicotine itself? I have tried l-theanine (tea and 200mg supplement) and SAM-e but they don't really compare. Any input would be much appreciated.

25a299	-60306	1399816427	StackAdvice	Nootropics to enhance sleep architecture/quality	I'm a Xanax casualty. After a pretty casual and naive three week binge (0.5-1mg per day, often before bed) I have found myself unable to achieve any kind of deep or restorative sleep - despite ten plus hours some nights - which is impacting on the whole gamut of brain function. I dream vividly every night and feel like the whole night is spent in REM. My awakenings are also regular and consistent - almost every 2 hours. This period was almost three months ago and the symptoms have barely improved. I've read about certain compounds that can enhance the deeper N3 and N4 stages of sleep: Lyrica, Gabapentin? I'd even consider short term temazepam if it might provide some relief. I'm interested in getting a sleep study referred through my Dr, so hopefully with some clinical evidence it shouldn't be too hard to broach the whole prescription thing.I might also add that mood enhancement  and anxiety relief is my other real priority with noots, so any that might be involved there too would be win-win. Any advice would be much appreciated.^^Edit: ^^paragraphs
2x3a5g	-60306	1424849842	StackAdvice	Ketamine fixed me. Nootropic alternatives?	Recreational use of NMDA antagonists (namely DXM and, more profoundly, ketamine) have been the only things to completely blow my depression/anhedonia out of the water over the past couple of years. This childlike zest for life is pretty surreal and understandably, I would be interested in any/all compounds which might mimic these effects. Even if these options are novel chemicals still in research, it would be nice to have something to hope for. • I take SSRIs which temper the lows but don't provide much in way of good feels. I would like to taper off them if possible.  • Tianeptine has provided relief in times of low mood• No discernible effect from Uridine stack, memantine, Noopept• I have a batch of Aniracetam on the way which I'm hoping to exploit for it's purported "social lubricant" effectsInterestingly, ketamine use/afterglow allowed me to enjoy cannabis for the first time in years. Usually it comes with soul crushing panic/introspection, however this was not the case. Maybe a possible anecdote pointing towards temporary positive brain changes the Ketamine provided. I'm sick of feeling like shit and sick of scouring /r/nootropics daily looking for the latest research into a magic bullet.What does the future hold for NMDA related antidepressants?

Even though there is a lot of boilerplateinvolved, CursorLoader made queries pretty convenient.Since ContentProviderOperation is Parcelable, I set up a small IntentService which took ContentProviderOperations via Intent and wrote them to the provider on a non-UI thread. Since this was bound by the lifecycle of the IntentService, it was reliable in cases the app went to background - all in around 15 lines of code.Now that RxJava is making a big splash, I'm wondering if anyone has a good pattern / idiom for using RxJava instead of ContentProvider. This would then allow the composing of database operations with other Rx operations. Basic necessities are:* Handle queries like loader - subscription initiates the query but it would onNext a new Cursor if something changed* How to handle transactions. Easy if everything is in one Observable, surrounded by beginTransaction / endTransaction. But what if We made Rx operators like Query, Insert, Update, Delete for chaining. How would a 'segment' of the pipeline be bound by a transaction?* How to make sure writes are reliable and outlive Activity if user puts app in the background. I started implementing a custom Scheduler which was similar to AsyncQueryService in the AOSP Calendar app.I'm hoping those smarter than I have been down this path before and have some ideas to share. I'm not worried about type safety of embedding of SQL directly in Java, or ORMs - thats another problem.Thanks

2q7ii3	-60314	1419366768	androiddev	Anything like "Filthy Rich Clients: Developing Animated and Graphical Effects for Desktop Java Applications" but for Android?	I've been developing for Android a few years now, but definitely feel more at home with the "non-UI" things. I've studied graphics design, usability, information architecture, and UX - so I know how I would like my screen layouts, navigation, and micro-interactions to be - but am poor at knowing how to **poke the Android APIs** to achieve my goals.Lately I've been wanting to create a widget like Windows Phone Home screen with draggable and resizable tiles, but I have absolutely no idea where to start.Most Android books I've seen do an admirable job of covering the supplied Widgets / Layouts for the most part, but somehow I missed the boat on first principles that would let me create these in the first place.Reto does a good job of creating a custom View (compass) in one edition, but I haven't seen much coverage of creating custom:* ViewGroups, Adapter based views, or extending RecyclerView LayoutManagers.* Animations* Drag and Drop to reorder views (there is at least one devbytes on this, but it was over my head)I'm looking for a thorough and systematic treatise on these things that begins from first principles. Kinda like the book mentioned in the title, but for Android. Anyone have suggestions?

Recently, I decided to add analytics to my app. So naturally, I started with Google Analytics v4 (GAV4) now in Play Services. The api is relatively straightforward.I kept seeing references to Tag Manager in the GA docs so I checked that out. Its basically a layer of indirection amongst GA and your app. Theoretically, you add primitive tagmanager  instrumenting code to the app and have Tag Manager translate that to GA calls. It was talked about at I/O 2013 , but this talk seems to focus more on the runtime configurability - not analytics.https://developers.google.com/events/io/2013/sessions/332761592What I'm wondering - is the extra complexity worth it for a sole developer? One use cases mentions marketers being able to tune analytics without having to work with the developer(s) again &amp; redeploy a new version with new instrumenting.It has some other nifty low-hanging fruit like being able to update some parameters of your app after deployment (like backend urls, timeouts), but I haven't found a use for this yet.**tl;dr** : just wondering if GA alone suffices for a single dev, or if GA + tagmanager is useful enough to warrant the extra level of indirection &amp; complexity.

I was hoping for some feedback from the reddit community about this UI design.I have a number of top-level interaction spaces which have master/detail relationships* 1) Devices -&gt; Device Data, Settings, Properties* 2) Dashboards -&gt; Data* 3) Datasets -&gt; Data* 4) Filters* 5) FeedsEach one of these master / detail spaces could be accomplished with SlidingPaneLayout.However, how would a user switch among these 5 spaces? So I thought the natural place to list these would be the NavigationDrawer (I already have several Spinners to fine tune detail like sorting, etc)The end result then is NavigationDrawer lists each space 1-5, and the content area is a SlidingPaneLayout which has master/detail of corresponding space.I coded it up, and low and behold, it actually works - NavigationDrawers cover the content, and content (SlidingPaneLayout) moves as expected.But I can't help but think that while this captures the hierarchy of my UI, its also a but "unusual". Its also very difficult to manage the toolbars in the SlidingPaneLayout master/detail.Has anyone done something similar, where there were a number of top-level master/detail views and you wanted the user to easily switch between them? Some alternatives:* Tabs - each Tab could be the Master for each space (1-4) and selecting an item could drill down into a detail space - but i dont see how to have master/detail on the same screen.* Spinners - i already have a few of these to tune the details data (like sorting, filtering, etc) so I didn't want to add more.

3ep0b5	-60314	1437943109	androiddev	How do you represent your developer account and apps on Goolge+?	I'm thinking about setting up Google+ specifically for my Android development efforts (so I can post news and have discussions with users). I haven't used Google+ until now (and probably won't use it for anything else soon).There are many Google+ concepts I am just learning (Profile, Page, Community, Collection)My goal is to have some landing page for my developer account in general. After that, it gets confusing.. should each app have its own Page, Community, or Collection?Eventually some apps should have private alpha and public beta channels in Play Store if that impacts anything.Just curious how others have mapped Google+ concepts to their own dev accounts and apps. I was leaning towards a g+ Page for my developer account (of kind "Brand"), and one for each app.Thanks

So last year I graduated with a BS degree in math, a minor in finance and a decent GPA, but have since become unhappy with my career options.  Therefore after doing some research I decided to go the actuarial route since I have a good background for it.  Now, I am set to take the first exam in May and I'm confident I will pass.  However, after reading a few posts here I became a little worried about my employability since I have no experience and will only have 1 test under my belt.  So I'm not exactly sure if upon passing exam P I should start applying to companies and training programs or should I take another exam or 2.  What do the actuaries of reddit think?  Any tips or comments at all would be very helpful.  Thanks!TL;DR Graduated last year with a BS in math, minor in finance and a decent GPA. Going to take Exam P in May.  What should I do afterwards?

Thank you all for your comments! They made me feel less like a total jerk for not being cool with the situation.  Also gave me some strength since I usually hate confrontation.  Since she refused to have the "logistics" discussion yesterday/does not want to talk in person, I sent her a brief message stating that I signed a lease with 3, not 4 roommates, my dog doesn't need added stress of more strangers (he's a rescue and shy, still doesn't like her even), and that it was too small here.  Her response was passive aggressive, but she said she'll be moving out. :DHey all, little backstory. I moved into my current apartment about 8months ago. It took forever to find one since I have a dog. Four of us signed the lease (me, M27, M24, and a girl who is no longer with us. About three months ago, M24 decided to sublet his room to a friend while he was traveling, 23F.  She seemed ok, although soon became pushy, would eat all my food, expect me to cook for her, and clean dishes. In short, she's a rude slob, and I was happy to be rid of her when M24 returned.In the meantime, the other girl originally on our lease decided to move in with her boyfriend. Without asking any of us, F23 declared she'd be living with us for good.  Yesterday, she texts me to say that the boyfriend who broke up with her just got back together, and he's coming to live with us. I've met him once and did NOT like him. Equally rude, slob, doesn't have a job, etc.  My dog does not like her nor him.Our apartment is small. It barely fits four of us as it is. But I've been overruled and told we'll "discuss logistics." For me, there's nothing to discuss. 27M is happy because the bf can be his weed smoking and guitar buddy. 24M is never home. My dog and I will be the one constantly dealing with him.Reddit, how in the world do I deal with this?TLDR: My shitty new roommate who isn't even on the lease is demanding her shitty boyfriend come live with us. How do I deal with this diplomatically?
1k5z45	-60337	1376256704	leagueoflegends	Buff to towers = Rise of Morgana?	Do you remember back in season 2 when you would play ranked, Morgana was ban almost every single game? Why? Because her team fight is stupidly strong as most people know because of her ult. Also she was an amazing roam ganker from mid. Why is she not ban anymore? Because in season 3 the meta changed to pushing down towers as fast as possible, and whats the most important tower for map control? mid. So if morgana roams she just loses tower right away and all your teams map control is gone. Morg is still a super strong champ. She just cant do the roam play style she is so good at, but with the upcoming armor buff to turrets, the meta will shift away from pushing down towers asap. Will this be the rise of Morgana once again? Will she be able to roam gank and roll face like she once could? Could she even move back to the permaban list? Thoughts?

1q9rx6	-60337	1384036617	leagueoflegends	Season 3 Ranked System is Broken (Here's why)	Yes i know there have been a million post about how much the ranked system is disliked, but what im doing is just pointing out some facts that show how very flawed the system is. While i will admit that i am a silver 1 player losing hope of getting gold before the season ends, i have thought long and hard about this system that is currently in place. Imo there are 4 large reasons why this system is flawed. While there are some good things to it, the flaws far out weigh the good1.   Ranked has become all about grinding. With the elo system you were either increasing or decreasing in elo, there was no grey area. This is not the case with the current system. I know myself and a few others that i play with have been in promotion after promotion series only to get a dc, troll, or even just lose and have to grind all the way back to 100 points just for another shot at the next division. I like the promotion idea, but it just doesnt work well from say Silver 3 to Silver 2. Maybe just give a promotion series from Silver to Gold etc.2.   Trolls and dcs can completely ruin the experience of ranked. Yes there are always going to be trolls, nothing that anyone can do about it. Again i think this problem mostly occurs in the promotion series. I can not count how many promotion series my friends and I have lost due to a troll or dc, only to get put back at 75 points. Yes even with the elo system there were trolls, but it was one game, you move on and go from there. It doesn't set you back so far that will make you want to stop ranked all together3.   Getting to 97-99 might be the most frustrating thing, especially when your at 80 points getting over 20 points the whole time and only get 19 for the last win. For example, previously with the elo system you would get roughly the same amount of elo gain or loss per game. (Unless winning/losing many in row) With the current system putting you at 97-99 points, (as long as your not in a division 1 of your tier in which case your only gaining 1-2 points) that means that the last win that should be giving you 20 points is only worth 1. It makes that last game incredibly hard, especially knowing if you lose it then your 3 games away your promo series.4.  The hidden MMR system is completely broken. At Silver 1 i have been paired with both Plat 5s and Bronze 4s, neither of which were duoed with anyone. I have both won and lost many games because there were people on my team or the other team that were not suppose to be in the game that they were in. The bronze 3 player that is 2nd pick, picks Zed mid, and gets stomped on over and over again only to wonder why it happened is a huge problem. Same thing with getting matched with a Plat top laner that starts Riven fort pot and wins the game in the first 10 minutes. Somehow the match making needs to be fixed, whether that is a problem with MMR, something needs to be doneAgain, I know there have been a million of these posts. I am just hoping to shed some light on something that me, a mediocre middle of the pack league player, thinks need to be done. Im not saying that i deserve to be Gold or anything like that, these are just some improvments to the ranked system I would love to see in Season 4.TL;DR 4 main problems with the ranked system right now. 1) Too much grinding instead because of the promotion series and how they work, should just have promotion series from silver to gold. 2) Trolls ruining promotion series can set you back multiple games instead of just recking that game. 3) Getting to 97-99 points when your not in division 1 of a tier. Having that last win almost pointless, and if you lose it now your 3 wins out of promotion. 4) Being in Silver 1 and playing with both Bronze 4s and Plat 5s, neither of which are duoed.

My Champion: I call him... BeveziddlemuPassive: Evelyn InvisibilityQ: Blitzcrank pullW: Fiddlesticks FearE: Ezreal Arcane ShiftR: Amumu UltThis is the ultimate support champion. Sit in lane invisible, pull people with you Q, fear them for days with your W. Then in team fights you can either Ezreal arcane shift pull someone, or ezreal arcane sift in then Amumu ult their entire team. Plus, with the invisibility, you would always be safe to ward!!

I was talking to him about Matt Smith, and he said that he thinks Smith is way less weird than either Tennant or Eccleston. This was mind-boggling to me, because I think Smith is absolutely the most naturally awkward and strange. I'm wondering what r/doctorwho thinks?Also, I'm just talking about New Who (this would be a different argument if we were talking about Classic too), and it's not an argument about who is the best or my favorite doctor. Whether or not Smith is my favorite, I still think he's the strangest.

My brother asked for a record player for Christmas, and I think it would be a PERFECT gift. The problem is my family tries to enforce a $50 limit on any one gift, and I can't afford to go much higher than that anyways. After reading through The Vinyl Guide, etc. it seems like my best shot is something off of ebay or craigslist, but I'm not very confident in my ability to spot quality since I don't know anything about players. I also don't think my brother has much experience with players, and am not sure what level his capability/willingness to fix a player up is.  If I know I can get an older one in good working quality, I'd go for that, but I don't know how to ensure it's good.So I'm trying to find a good player to start with, working under the assumption that if he really becomes a huge audiophile, he can get a more expensive/better quality set-up that he can choose for himself later. Any recommendations?**TL:DR** I want to buy my brother a good cheap player to start out with, and am pretty much completely ignorant in this area. HELP!

They had $129.99 bundles with Mario kart and $149.99 bundles with Pokemon ( y I think). The free game should be on top of that.

I think he would love this for Christmas. Good idea? How is the difficulty? He plays skyrim, halo no problem. The demo is really hard, but I heard it doesn't do the game justice. I'm not too concerned with content since skyrim is probably more graphic. Its only $25 on amazon right now. I'm between that and Lego the hobbit. Thanks!!

It's reprehensible. I started, [back last year to back Ubuntu-desktop](https://www.bountysource.com/search?query=ubuntu) using my gains from the FTSE.After more than a dozen bounties placed, clearly I follow up every so often to see how launchpad has evolved in discussion to see whether the bounties are coming to fruition.After a [chat with a senior Ubuntu developer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/2rag1f/ubuntu_gets_major_boost_on_bountysource_more/) I was brought back in-to line by silxx mentioning that the bounties are too low. Then it was made clear to those in the discussion, don't find the bounties appealing from a financial point of view.**Bemused.** after posting onto reddit and setting about letting others know I'm now *spun-out* in terms of the effect, even though I know that the social side has run it's course, and been helpful , in that someone targeting the Ubuntu platform for improvements would search these issues.Not only is there an issue over dollars making a difference in the feature, and [perhaps in the unwanted sense](http://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/not-much-i-know-but-what-does-everybody-tink-about-the-ten-dollar-bountysource/1865), but also when you see the bounties you'll note that it only takes someone like ben kerensa to point out that [the bugs can be changed at the drop-of a hat](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/987060/comments/45) to :confirmed → unconfirmed. .... this has simply given me one sense, that came into effect just after one day after it was posted on G+  ... mind blown.I always keep an open-mind on these things- but the [debate stalls](https://plus.google.com/s/stuart%20langridge%20bountysource) *when* people are approached about financial-incentives for Foss.It just seems people aren't interested. The company, the social-side, the community,  the users. If anything, I've been berated about my vote-with-your-wallet actions and I've become more aware of how simple it is to dial-in to the bountysource phenomenon and put up a possible solution, albeit, it seems,  raking over the coals.

Hi guys, just another question .. wondering if there would be a benefit to funding [Steam O/S](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/valve/issues?tracker_ids=42641) on the linux platform.I really want to see this going forward and have already donated to it, but find the talk has stalled, even from as late back as 2011.I hope you read this and talk to me about which bugs *really* need to be funded.Cheers guys.

I thought of idea while typing Clickey into freenode,Irc, ABOUT doing a Cricket App for Ubuntu for playing on a traditional cricket-field with all of the usual players etc .. then I had the brilliant-idea :#URBAN-style cricket.Sounds good idea to me .. playing in farm yards where the ball can bounce off cow-sheds, or playing in the play-ground where the ball can bounce off the bike-shed and get extra points for hitting these areas. Kinda like a cricket version of [Real Tennis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_tennis) .. where you get points for putting the ball into certain areas - not just over the boundary line.So what areas could be applied ?* Playground - 'round the back of the bike-sheds cricket.* Farmyard cricket - with chickens going past and everything.* Underground cricket - disused London underground station up-cycled into a small cricket area.* Famous places cricket - like the Taj Mahal and playing under the Eiffel Tower etc* Castle cricket - in Scotland there be a dis-used castle with Urban-crickets' name on it.* POW cricket - British prisoners play cricket in Stallag Camp.* Moon cricket - Spacemen play cricket slower and with more precision.The list goes on and on , but I shall stop there. Any comments , and I'll ask where you used to play cricket as a kid.

Last night I pulled up at a Lancashire B&amp;B and it took me the evening to realise the point of Ubuntu TV.The point is to have a reliable package either through a USB hub or something plugged into the side that integrates Ubuntu TV into the hotel market.Of course I may be wrong here, but I think if you have a pleasurable experience in the hotel-sphere using Ubuntu on your tele - then it only propagates into the home environment.Sure enough I spent over 15 minutes looking at the chineses remote control and thinking that Ubuntu TV could do a damn-site better and be able to plug into BBC and local station feeds etc.So how about it - forget trying to get www.hotelwifi.com and think in terms of the next time you pull up to a hotel that you're certain to come across an Ubuntu box just to the left of your bedroom TV - why not ?

So anyways, it was not five weeks ago that I needed to use my sure pay-as-you-go mobile for net traffic at home .. only to realise that Sure, in their wisdom, have started to cap internet usage on their pay-as-you-go sim cards. So much so that I can't use a five pound sim card for longer than two days after that, it says that I have no credit left. Two options: - go to the local community centre or live off coffee-shop wifi (possibly at the hossy or somewhere). It really annoys me that sure mobile have done this . I'll never sign up to a contract, because of anonymity. But I will go and buy coffee more and log on there to do my stuff.The second thing is the **revamp of manxradio.com.** For quite some time you could go to their website and press "right click , save file as" to any broadcast. Now in *their* infinite wisdom you can't because they've clued into some 'witholding, extra window' that won't let you do that. I hate it . I hate it all. But who do you complain to ? And would they listen ? Prob/ly not.My 2 Btc, but as it is here: What's good *just gets fucked up.*

I recall this conversation a couple of years ago and noted that the [catincan-funding](https://www.catincan.com/bounty/taskbar-second-monitor-issue-130-linuxmint-cinnamon-github) website was no longer working from my bookmarks.I was just wondering whether this ever got sorted out ? or if Clem thought this was an issue that could *never be* fixed ?Here's the [github issue](https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/issues/130) with over #230 comments supporting it.

Usually, I log onto [Bad Voltage/community](http://community.badvoltage.org/) and love the interactivity with Greg and other people/users in the community.That all changed when I logged on to see the messages that two out the three new topics of discussion related to banking loans and what seemed a mind-numbing amount of money-babble about whether I could afford a house or not.I already have a house and feel this is regarded as spam.As the 1x47 episode is already a day late and the team seem non-contactable through twitter, I thought that I'd leave this as a reminder to be vigilant against spammers and their links.You never know who's after your computer these days.[Screenshot of forum topics.( 4th and 6th down )](https://web.archive.org/web/20150724182845/http://community.badvoltage.org/)[Screenshot of banking scam one on community.](https://web.archive.org/web/20150724183021/http://community.badvoltage.org/t/with-250k-in-bank-can-i-buy-a-home/10557)[Screenshot of banking scam two on community.](https://web.archive.org/web/20150724183121/http://community.badvoltage.org/t/bad-credit-rating-cash-loans-assistance-not-a-problem-anymore/10555)The screenshots aren't great, but this just shows the basic info. &amp; that this is not good - it is Bad.

3f2aw3	-60344	1438196390	CrazyIdeas	TeleCoin. Allowing televisions to mine cryptocurrency using UbuntuTV watch what they can buy thru adverts on TeleCoin.tv	So let's face it the TV experience is a one way street - your just broadcast to. You sit there and let the hours clock up while you pay the TV license for another monotonous year.Then an advert for a new cryptocurrency that can be "mined" through the graphics card on the Linux compatible TV set while you sit there.The advet is for a new Cryptocurrency called TeleCoin.Suddenly, you realize that the TV set is capable of being a block-chain-type-coin miner, and that you could pay for the TV set and then some. As the TV is based on Ubuntu TV it allows for things like steam, and skype and all the free applications that are available on desktop through the unified codebase of Ubuntu.This sets you going. Maybe I could do social or hangouts, maybe I could do chat-roulette etc. This is now a game changer that is promoted by a block-chain that allows for more and more inovation, as the customer is under the impression that it's an investment, it's better than de-valued bitcoin, and let face it the guy on TV said it was secure and frugal to do this - so people do.TV's suddenly become party-machines and while people catch up on big-brother or east-enders, they're clocking up the mining part of the deal, which makes them buy stuff through the TeleCoin TV station.There's a circle of profitability, that goes global. And everyone with an internet connection starts mining for Telecoin and the market flourishes and TV's become interactive with UbuntuTV becoming the standard means to watch Tele.so what you think of Telecoin ?

Ok Ok, so fair enough I'm in my late thirties, but every time I turn on BBC Radio 1 on my bed-side alarm clock DAB radio ... I think.Is the younger generation missing the lyrics (if you can catch their meaning ?), and what I'd term as better music of the nineties and naughties over the airwaves.Most of the time, I just don't get **that pummelling** of my poor radio gets at the hands of Annie Nightingale's bass boomers and the like. So the question is am I getting too old to listen to Radio 1 and should just stay on [Radio 2](http://lsn-to.radiofeeds.net/BR2) ?And do you agree ?

3gbn0u	-60344	1439098976	fossconfession	I've never used the OpenSource/Free Software 'side' of my GNU/Linux programs.	So here's the thing, at the end of the day - I'm just one guy, but there must be millions like me.I use Ubuntu LTS and have tried, believe me to get in touch with other users to have the discussion about where to get 'into' opensource and coding, but failed every-time.I live in a small community where people don't really care about free-software. I've tried doing the whole free-software-day hosting but, well, it reminded me of the whole 'remote-control' car club, where people said 'look what I've got' and they'd never tell you how they'd got there.So I don't know how to get source, view source and make changes. And I need to know how to ask how to do this ?Equally, is coding just a solitary thing, or do people help each other to do it ? Because I've never had a helper.I hope to be able to-do this with my Ubuntu-style distro, by way of downloading the code through my office windows laptop and transfering to my offline Ubuntu laptop. I think that's the safest.Thanks for the help- perhaps this is my biggest confession.

3gtz02	-60344	1439459273	Ubuntu	Can Anyone recall when Launchpad/Ubuntu had a bounty program back in 2004 ? Which programs ?	I was listening to [Community Q &amp; A on youtube](https://youtu.be/UbiuM9pF5a4?t=52m38s) this week, and Daniel Holbach, reminded me that there was such a system , in Launchpad 2004/5.. it just never really took off.I was just looking at those times and development mechanisms, and wondered if anyone else recalled those times.Perhaps someone could call up a page on web.archive.org or something, as I'd really like to do a paper on the problems that people not used to bounties encounter when another user introduces the idea of money into fixing bugs.Irrelevant if you agree with bounties or free-software with financial incentives (bugs with perks), I'd like to get people together to see exactly what kind of stick you'd have to dangle in front of the coders in order to get them to focus on a particular problem, or not, as the case maybe, and perhaps how that affects the community.Also **if you know of such references** ( to-do with crowdfunding etc ) then **let me know below**. Cheers.Ref: [The bounties of Ubuntu](http://bit.ly/ubuntubounties) (amongst others).

s18m8	-60351	1333999313	AskReddit	I hope this is the place for this question. Anyone detoxed from suboxone or subutex after prolonged usage?	When i was in my late teens i had a problem with Heroin. I used for about 2 and a half years. I had a few attempts on sobriety but always seemed to end right at the same place. I finally tried suboxone one last time to get clean and it worked :) 5 years sober this year! Now the bad part... I have been on suboxone the WHOLE time. Most people would disagree with the amount of time i have been on it, but hey, I never relapsed. Well, now i have a toddler, and i am counting down the days until i am done. (Yes i had her while on suboxone.) I am very nervous, to the point of severe anxiety and depression. I am scared of getting sick. I will never forget the feeling of detoxing from suboxone. I have done it before, i know what it will feel like. I guess my real question is, how am i going to do this? My husband works late until the evening, so I am home with my daughter alone all day. What should i do to prepare? Am i just making up excuses to continue the suboxone use? I talk to my family and husband and no one seems to understand. Anything will help, any advice from my older redditors. I know i am technically still an addict, or atleast thats how i feel chained to this medication. I can no longer afford the thousands i waste on it. I do not have a choice, i know i need to do this...TL/DR- Suboxone user in need of detox advice..

13ubfc	-60351	1353974635	BabyBumps	Just want a little love and advice for a scared mommy...	So found out 2 weeks ago that i was pregnant. Went to OB and told them my last LMP which was sept 29th. It placed me at about 7 almost 8 weeks pregnant. The other night i started a light spotting and was concerned. I waited a few days and it started again, so my husband called the doctor yesterday. They told me to come into the materity ward at the hospital to get checked. When i got my initial ultrasound they found no heartbeat and no fetus. It was very scary. I was then told i needed more testing. I got an "official" U/S as they call it. It came back with the same information. They saw a yolk sac and a spot for the fetus.. but nothing was there. I was dated by the U/S to be 5 weeks. They said after all the findings, my gestation shouldn't be that far off. So i have a 50/50 for a miscarriage. Has any other mommies been this off with there LMP? I know its "too early" now to tell if the pregnancy is no longer thriving.. I just want some form of hope. I go to my OB tomorrow to get more testing.. But still wont know any answers. I was told if there is no heartbeat found in a week to week and a half i will have to get a D&amp;C. Any advice or information would be greatly appreciated! Just have been through a lot of horrible things this year. It would be very upsetting to deal with this.. but i feel like i have to expect the worst now :(

If you want sugar and chocolate It's a GIRl! With my first pregnancy all i wanted was candy.. cereal.. icing.. I literally went to cupcake places.. and bought just the icing and went home and ate it with a spoon! This pregnancy is TOTALLY different! All i want is salty and spicy food. My stomach wont even allow me to drink Soda! I would love to hear that is a sign for a boy! Just a fun post to hear what your stories are! I have a little girl already!

I have tried holding my nose and breathing from my mouth. Nothing helps! As soon as I see the poop and take that first smell D: I can't hold back the throw up. I can't even finish the diaper changing. I have to vomit and come back.. vomit and come back.. and somehow finish until I can get the dirty diaper far far away. My husband works 2 jobs and isn't home ever. So I just don't know what to do.. I can't have this happen anymore. Is there anyone this has happened to? Any ideas to help me? I just don't want to dread these shitty diapers for the rest of my pregnancy :'( Any advice or info will be greatly appreciated.

Everyone says, "well you still get the kills and what not.." But that is NOT what i care about lol. I just want my stats to change. I have such low level scores saved.. I look like a newb kinda.. I have been so much further, but no lie.. EVERY game someone backs out. I feel like this may be the reason I stop playing zombies all together :( At least anything but solo.
19vqnx	-60351	1362703629	BabyBumps	Great news!! And... scary news..	It's a BOY! Fantastic :) I have a 3 and a half year old daughter, so a boy is a fantastic addition! Every thing looks great.. tech measures organs and size.. Says she got everything, just needs to check pictures in the other room and will come back in a bit. Well 15 minutes later a doctor walks in. (local hospital is where i got u/s done) He says the kidneys look a bit abnormal. Abnormal?! What does this mean? He does the u/s and goes over everything again and stops back at the kidneys. Saying they look dialated and its not normal size for a 20 week baby. After he finished the scan he went on and told me is the most common problem in u/s scans and is quite normal for boys. This is all scary up to this point but i can manage.. Until he says its a marker for downs. I have now 2 things to worry about? I have no other signs for any chromosomal abnormalities and also have had the 1st trimester screening done which all came back great. So he gave me the choice of an amnio, the verifi test.. or nothing and wait. I chose to do the verifi test just to rule out downs for good (verifi is 99% accurate)Will be going back April 4th to do an u/s on kidneys.. I guess i just wanted to come and let this out to you ladies.. I don't want to talk about it in person with anyone right now :/ Everyone tells me not to worry.. it'll be fine. But i'd like to know if anyone else has had this happen, or knows anyone? Just like to hear it from women who've dealt with this and not a doctor for once. I already promised myself not to google! So, yea! Rant done.. and blessed to have a daughter and now a son! Thank you for reading &lt;3

1f4yoo	-60365	1369664277	drumbuilding	First test run of painting gloss stripes in drums. Need some advice	So I made my first attempt at doing gloss stripes on a drum finish, using cheap drums as my test subjects. I did two coats of undercoat and two coats of black gloss, allowing adequate drying time. The painters tape I used was normal 3M scotch and I purposely left some wood area bare near the stripe to see if the black paint would leak through, which it didn't.Now for the problem, the undercoat did its job very well and sealed in the black gloss, but it has left behind a residue which forms a border of sorts around the black. [Here is an image of what I am talking about](http://imgur.com/a/o2y17)I have narrowed it down to a few things: The painters tape has left the residue, or just needs to be stuck down better, etc. and I need to invest in a better quality tape, eg. multi-surface. Or the bare wood grain has enabled the undercoat to seep through. Sorry for dragging on but I thought you guys in here might have some experience or suggestions as it would be much appreciated, cheers! TL;DR: Undercoat formed border, do not want.

1wjd2l	-60366	1391062713	redditcasual	Intro Post - CuseFan03	First off, I've got to say I enjoy this sub quite a bit. As a big time casual gamer, I've never really enjoyed the intensity of most gaming subs.I'm 29, been married for a couple years (with a son on the way in May!), and have been in the Navy for almost 12 years. I'm stationed outside of Tokyo and have been living in Japan for a year now. It's definitely different over here, but I have to say it's been awesome so far.I like all sorts of video games, not just CoD. Some of my all time favorites (in no particular order) would be: The Legend of Zelda - Link to the Past (SNES), Super Mario Brothers 3 (NES), Silent Hill 2 (PS1), GTA Vice City (PS2), Final Fantasy 1 (NES), Portal 1 (Xbox 360) and tons more that I may add in as an edit later. I own quite a few gaming consoles as well, from my Atari 2600 and up.I'm really into all sorts of things, and all sorts of people. I'm definitely open-minded and am willing to be friends with anyone that's not a hateful or negative person. Just a random thing - I really loved the book Ready Player One by Ernest Cline? Has any one else read that? I would love to nerd it up chatting about that book. If you haven't read it, I highly suggest you do.My Xbox Gamertag is CuseFan03. Feel free to send me a friend request if you'd like, or if you have any questions or just wanna BS, let me know!

It has Cascade, Field Scout, and Full Auto). I play pretty casually and just on one character so of my 29 strange coins, this would be a decent sized purchase.

2y58ia	-60366	1425657576	DestinyTheGame	[Misc] Big day for this casual!	So as the title says, I play frequently, but casually. I'm in the military and stationed in Japan so due to work/deployment schedules and the crazy time difference from the US, I don't get to raid very often (Vog and CE on normal only, never had a group to run hard with). That being said, I have only earned/bought a few exotics for my troubles. Before today those were only armor and were the Armamentarium (one of two exotic drops I've ever gotten), No Backup Plans (the other drop) and the Glasshouse which I purchased from Xur. Well I've been saving up and skipped out on Xur the last few weeks and was able to buy the Helm of Saint 14 AND Icebreaker today! I know this isn't big news for anyone, and many of you Guardians out there are probably yawning, but I'm so stoked to finally have one of the essential weapons and helms in this game! To make it better, I turned in my Motes and the chest piece I got...Crest of Alpha Lupi! RNG usually laughs at me as it throws nothing but Ascendant materials at me but today I got one over and couldn't be happier! Anyway, just wanted to share my excitement. Hope RNGesus is blessing you all this week, see you out there!TL;DR - Casual player has almost no exotics, gets Icebreaker, Helm of Saint 14 and Crest of Alpha Lupi all in one day. Couldn't be happier.

Where possible, try to provide links to reputable sources to support your predictions.Ok, here goes my attempt:5 years:* 1. The industrialisation of [additive manufacturing](http://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2012/11/additive-manufacturing?fsrc=scn/fb/wl/bl/printajetengine) will result in products being made where they are bought, rather than being shipped from overseas.* 2. [Carbon fibre](http://www.autoblog.com/2012/11/27/manufacturing-advances-bring-carbon-fiber-closer-to-mass-product/) will be used extensively in new vehicles, especially electric cars.* 3. Augmented reality technology (in conjunction with [transparent OLED displays](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTVPVobDrms)) will become more refined and more useful in everyday life - from providing you with [useful information while on foot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnRJaHZH9lo), to helping you [navigate while driving](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F4lj3hh_18Y/T0rWMqCEOkI/AAAAAAAAAsY/dV5v-IsvZus/s1600/HUD+Augmented+Reality+-+Copy.jpg).* 4. Highly efficient, flexible, wall sized, [quantum dot displays](http://nextbigfuture.com/2011/02/full-colour-quantum-dot-displays.html) and [solar cells](http://apl.aip.org/resource/1/applab/v100/i19/p192102_s1?view=fulltext&amp;bypassSSO=1) will enter the market.* 5. [In vitro meat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_meat) will be commercially available but won't be as cheap (or as tasty) as real meat… yet.10 years:* 1. Autonomous electric vehicles will be everywhere - your own personal [transportation pod](http://dornob.com/driverless-self-parking-postmodern-mobile-home-design/), a network of [delivery UAVs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7B3E4OOuGDk), [road trains and trucks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lEam-Hxv4), etc…* 2. [3D bio-printed organs](http://www.euronews.com/2012/11/13/the-computer-printer-at-the-heart-of-the-matter/) made from your own tissue will replace human/animal transplants.* 3. There will be [no Arctic sea ice](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/17/arctic-collapse-sea-ice) during the Northern summer.* 4. You will be able to live as comfortably as you do now but completely off the grid (even in the city) - solar panels and wind turbines on the roof, [battery room](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sddb0Khx0yA) in the basement, super efficient appliances, [nanotech rain and wastewater filtration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology_in_water_treatment).* 5. Work will begin on a large scale [evacuated tube maglev transportation system](http://www.et3.com/).20 years:* 1. Everyone will get around domestically using personal, autonomous, [carbon composite battery](http://www.economist.com/node/15993451) powered aircraft similar to NASA's '[Puffin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhpPhvWvLgk)', that can rapidly recharge using [solar paint](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/04/120425140455.htm) and [supercapacitors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_double-layer_capacitor). And internationally in autonomous [hydrogen jets](http://www.techi.com/2011/09/lockheed-envisions-ultra-long-range-hydrogen-jet/) (made possible by [CNT reinforced storage tanks](http://www.appliednanotech.net/news/120917_Hydrogen_Fuel_Tanks.php))* 2. [Personalised medicine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine) based on your own genome.* 3. [Robotic limbs](http://youtu.be/_qUPnnROxvY) and [exoskeletons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLnOPA7oMxY&amp;feature=youtu.be) will blend seamlessly with the user by direct [neurological connectivity](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/11/mind-controlled-robotic-arm/).* 4. Half our fruit and vegetables will come from local, hydroponic, [vertical urban farms](http://www.thedailygreen.com/cm/thedailygreen/images/YP/evf-vertical-farm-de.jpg).* 5. Global tectonic activity will increase as a result of [uplift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-glacial_rebound) due to glacier melt, and the redistribution of billions of tonnes of meltwater.And during all these time periods, nanotechnology will play an increasingly important role until it is literally in *everything*.

1iy6fs	-60369	1374663835	Futurology	The potential of the coming transportation revolution.	Got a bit bored while sick in bed today, so thought I'd put this together.This scenario could be possible within 10 - 20 years:You are going out for a few drinks with friends, so you step out of your house and onto the street. There are a few cars around, most with people inside, some without.You get out your smartphone, open the 'iCab' app, input your location information &amp; intended destination, how many passengers/luggage, and if you would like to share with other commuters for a discounted rate.After inputing your details, the app gives you an approximate time of arrival based on GPS and traffic data - in this case it's 30 seconds (average of 1 minute in cities, 8 minutes in rural areas). It also shows you on a map, which electric iCab has been selected (using a complex algorithm based on distance, destination, passengers, sharing, charge left, etc).The driverless iCab arrives and automatically 'syncs' with your smartphone when you enter so it can charge your account. You head off, and a short time later arrive at your destination after catching up on some emails.A few hours later...You have a good night but things get out of hand, and you end up drinking until you can't feel feelings anymore, so you decide to leave. You press the 'drunk' button in the iCab app (which is pre-programmed with your preferences), and one immediately pulls up. You slump inside, pass out, and awake to a loud buzzer and simulated voice informing you that you have arrived at your destination.Due to most people (not just drunks) now using this as their primary mode of transport, many people no longer need to own their own car and traffic congestion decreases. The rate of road fatalities also drops drastically since the human element is now removed from the equation. And once it is globally adopted, this technology results in a massive decrease in CO2 emissions. This scenario also makes economic sense for both the public and companies who own these cabs. For example, you could have a petrol car that costs AU $30,000 to buy new, which = yearly costs:* Car Loan Repayment: $7,200* Registration/Tax: $650* Insurance: $1000* Breakdown Cover: $100* Fuel: $3,500* Tyres: $400* Servicing: $600* Parts: $650* Parking/Tolls: $400Total: AU **$14,500/year**Or using an iCab you could pay 10¢-50¢/km (depending if you share or not) x 22,000km/year = **$6,600/year** (average).For a transportation company, each electric iCab could cost $30,000 and travel 350,000km/year = $100,000 average revenue/year (this is assuming [advanced li-ion batteries](http://cleantechnica.com/2013/02/19/next-generation-lithium-ion-battery-designed-should-hit-market-within-2-3-years/) continue to get cheaper, more energy dense, and last longer).Yearly costs:* Car Loan Repayment: $7,200* Registration/Tax: $650* Insurance: $500 (less, due to lower accident risk)* Breakdown Mechanic Fees: $200 (less moving parts means fewer breakdowns)* Recharging: $4,600 (mostly renewable)* Tyres: $10,000* Servicing: $1000* Parts: $500* Tolls: $1000Total: AU **$25,650/year**Total Profit: AU **$74,350/year**With a fleet of 1,000 vehicles = $74,350,000/year profitIf you owned one of these electric driverless cars it would cost you:* Car Loan Repayment: $7,200* Registration/Tax: $650* Insurance: $300 (less due to lower accident risk)* Breakdown Cover: $50 (less moving parts means fewer breakdowns)* Recharging: $200 (mostly renewable)* Tyres: $400* Servicing: $400* Parts: $200* Parking/Tolls: $200Total: AU **$9,600/year**Some extra, random thoughts:The app could also have a function that allows you to set a pickup time and location, for example, if you plan on going for a one way hike and need picking up at the other end in the middle of nowhere.iCabs could also charge more $/km if you have luggage or weigh a lot (relative to height) due to the car needing more battery power per extra kilogram - thus putting a clearer monetary value on the cost of being overweight. This would hopefully encourage people to eat less and exercise more resulting in less of a burden on the healthcare system and the environment due to over consumption.1 iCab would replace 15 regular cars.There would be safety and security measures such as video cameras and emergency buttons, etc...If anyone actually reads this then feel free to let me know if I got anything wrong (I'm sure there's plenty!). Does all this seem realistic? Can you see any issues that might occur? In what other directions could you see this revolution in transportation going?

1mhsdj	-60369	1379329421	Futurology	In order for large scale automated delivery drone networks to exist, will it be nesseccary for homes/businesses to have a landing pad?	It wouldn't have to be a very big landing pad, maybe 1 metre square. It could be registered and its exact GPS coordinates recorded (kind of like an address), so people would know where to send things. The landing pads could be mounted on roofs so no one would be near the spinning blades of the drone when it lands. The drone could autonomously set the package down, then fly away. Then you could either go and get it from the pad or an elevator would lower it down into the home/office.This system could start out on a small scale between a couple of locations (like the early stages of the telegraph or Internet), and then expand if it works.Could you see something like this working?I know Matternet is working on this but I'm not sure if they have proposed a GPS landing pad system that would open this technology up to everyone?

This works great on the whole however some of the clients VPN connections disconnect every now and again. Not every client disconnects at the same time so i know its not the internet connection going down. Some clients stay connected for the whole day while others will disconnect several times in a day. The disconnects happen completely at random ie a client can be connected for 55 mins before a disconnect and others 18 minutes etc. All client pc's are running windows 7 with the same standard image. I have cheked the event logs on the clients and they all have the following error in the application log: "The user DOMAIN\User dialed a connection named Data Centre which has terminated. The reason code returned on termination is 829."I have looked up error 829 and it relates to: "The modem (or other connecting device) was disconnected due to link failure" Which indicates a network blip. What i cant understand is if it is down to a network blip why arent all 14 clients vpn connections disconnected at the same time? Any help troubleshooting this would be great. Cheers

I can ping the managment ip address no problem and the SAN appears to be working fine apart from this issue. I was able to access unisphere yesterday but today when i tried to browse to the site it will not load and just displays a blank white page. I have tried via http and https. (It was set to use https before). When using https i get the usual certificate warning message as i normally would but when i click proceed, that is when i get the blank page) I have followed this link: https://community.emc.com/docs/DOC-17340 and have reset the mananagment IP address but after the configuration utility had finished i still have the same issue and cannot connect to Unisphere. To make matters worse i do not have SSH enabled on the box. I also do not have a d9 micro serial cable to hand to connect that way. Does anybody know a way of getting unisphere up again? Would an out of hours reboot fix this problem? The next chance i will get to reboot it would be the weekend so if anyone has any suggestions i can try before then i would be very greatful. Thanks

I've been subscribed to them for awhile now and I truly believe they're the most legit source for relevant news.I want them to do a story on the rise of e cigarettes and modding.They have millions of subscribers, and really dedicated followers. It would be an AMAZING way to spread the truth about what we actually do.Think about it, they could go interview juice vendors, mod makers, consumers, and vape shops. Also some anti-vapers too (just to get the full story).I might get an avalanche of downvotes for this, but I just wanted to hear what you guys think, and the best way to present this idea to the company. Cuz I'm tired of all the stories on vaping being so negative.

2d6bem	-60380	1407704377	electronic_cigarette	Questions about dual 18650 regulated box mods	Hey so I've been vaping on mechanical mods for about a year now. I usually run dual coil setups at around .15 of an ohm. I also have a custom mech mod with a hybrid top connector, meaning the atty makes direct contact with the battery. This makes the mod hit HARD. Like, crazy hard, and HOT. With that being said, is there a dual 18650 box mod out there that will fulfill my personal vaping preferences?I heard you can vape like 10 hours without swapping your battery's! Is this true?And finally, what is the best box mod on the market right now?

1at27l	-60389	1363970470	Planetside	Results of Lancer testing	So I spent an hour or two just now testing the lancer and its various properties, and this is what I got;Rough estimate of the base damage per projectile appears to be in the neighborhood of 250-300 or so, probably 250. Thats the damage you get from a 1-charge blast or a hipfire or popshot.Charging it increases the damage dramatically. 2 charges increases it to 750 or so, and 3 charges increases it to 1500. So each level of charge adds a damage multiplier equal to its level, +1 +2 +3 or 1, 3, 6 times normal damage.Its very accurate, but it does seem to have some wander; higher charged shots seem to have slightly less accuracy, and its not entirely clear if you can "partially miss"; higher charged shots have 3 visible projectiles around the bolt, and it seems like sometimes only 1-2 of them hit if you very narrowly graze the target, but I could not see a loss of damage to it. It may just be graphical. it does have some kick if you spam shots, however. The kick and wander should only be an issue if you're aiming at a vehicle at extreme range. None of this accuracy stuff applies if you're hipfiring instead of doing ADS, for what its worth. It basically has no accuracy if you're hipfiring, it's only good for point blank in that case.A fully charged shot will do about 750 explosive damage to a player; you CAN snipe people with it, but only if they're already half dead or missing their shields, and don't have flak. In general, it will have no use in that vein, save for killing maxes (which it is pretty okay at; a fully charged shot does about 60% of a MAX's health).Finally, the projectile velocity is VERY high, so you can actually snipe fighters on the wing with it with a little skill, and almost certainly nail anything on the ground no matter what. It does, however, leave a giant glowing line directly to your location for anyone viewing from in front or the side- just like a sniper tracer, but much much moreso.Edit: thanks to qazzq, we have some velocity info:Projectile velocity is 500m/s, and it has a 1 sec duration, so it has a strict maximum range of 500 meters. So consider its optimal role is basically going to be fully charged tank sniping at moderate to long range: a small crew with these firing fully charged shots into the rear of a tank from 200-300m is going to be scary and have basically no warning.So TLDR:1 charge 250 damage2 charge 750 damage3 charge 1500 damagefully charged shots most efficient, fully charged shot and 3 popshots gives you the highest DPS for a clip (2250 damage, a bit more than a decimator). Never use a 2-charge shot unless you'll 100% fail to hit by waiting for 3. Popshots will generally be only useful for finishing people off who are burning, or Flashes.For relative damage to targets, think of a regular homing missile's dumbfire damage. Its the same.

1scbek	-60410	1386452097	changemyview	I believe depression is self-inflicted, you can pull yourself up by your bootstraps and need to do exactly that. CMV.	Inspired by [this comic](http://www.akimbocomics.com/comic/2010-10-04-Eat_Shit_And_Die_164.jpg), which is exactly the **wrong** way to deal with depression, I'd like to posit a few statements about depression and ideally you can educate me and change my view.**1. Depression is self-inflicted**People who suffer from depression are usually not billionaires, bon vivants and socially esteemed high achievers, but those who made bad decisions in the past. They maybe didn't follow through with their education, they maybe didn't find out what motivates them in life, they maybe abused drugs and/or alcohol, they maybe put all their effort in getting meaningless sex. Now they're an empty shell and don't know why.You might point me to some celebrity exceptions, those who seem to have it all, but still suffer depression to the point where they even commit suicide. But do they really have it all? Some abuse drugs, some can't form a personal relationship, some become arrogant assholes.You can change my view on this by giving me statistics that prove that sober, highly connected, social, educated people are at the same risk to become depressed as drug/alcohol abusing, shut-in, antisocial, uneducated people.**2. Depressed people can pull themselves up by their bootstraps**Following contention 1, depressed people can find out why they are depressed and do something about it. They can find their passion in life, they can become healthier, more educated, gain social skills, etc. If you're depressed because you don't have a significant other, work towards that goal. If you loathe your minimum-wage job, get higher education or start your own business. If you are disgusted by your appearance, work out and eat healthily.The comic at the start simply addresses depression as if the people around the protagonist don't acknowledge or understand it. In my opinion, when someone tells you that they're depressed, you shouldn't tell them to snap out of it, but rather ask: "What are you doing about it?"Change my view.

Maybe I didn't understand because of my limited English abilities, I even rewatched the scene, but I can't wrap my head around it: Max, the mother's then-boyfriend, was running late to her birthday party. She gets a phone-call, confirms that it's her and is visibly devastated after the information that she just got.She gets home, finds a nicely wrapped birthday gift and some tissues around it. In later scenes, she talked about him dying.At first I though she was making it up because she doesn't want to commit to a new relationship and Max just broke up with her. This would also explain why there's a gift at home, but he didn't show up. Yet later, she still stuck to her story about him dying, so he might actually have.But how? Was it mentioned in a previous episode? Did he die on the way from home to her party? Then why was the present still at home? What clues am I missing? Or wasn't it mentioned at all and intentionally left up for speculation?

3b35y3	-60410	1435249195	PurplePillDebate	"Sexual strategy is amoral"	I can get behind many RP concepts, but this phrase irks me whenever I encounter it: "Sexual strategy is amoral." Not because it isn't true, but because of the context when it's used.**General example:** A man does something horrible in order to gain sexual gratification from a woman. Someone points out how horrible the thing is that the man did. Retort: "Sexual strategy is amoral."**Concrete example:** A man pretends to be in an exclusive relationship with a woman. He is actually dating 10 women at the same time, pretending to be exclusive with each of them. Someone points out that this is a horrible thing to do. Retort: "Sexual strategy is amoral."A comparison that's often made is that guns are amoral. Now let me draw a parallel:A person walks into a school and kills dozens of people. Someone points out how horrible that is. Will we hear the retort that guns are amoral? No. Why not? Because that is not the point. It is true that guns are amoral, but their use is not. You can use a gun to protect yourself and others, or you can use it to inflict a great deal of harm. The same is true with sexual strategy.I have no problem with men being privy to concepts of the sexual market place, what turns women on or how even how to bed many consenting women. However, **the application of sexual strategy is NOT amoral.**If we define morality as the degree of human flourishing, as human well-being, there are certain actions and behaviors that can be regarded as deeply immoral. Killing people? Mostly immoral. Assaulting people? Mostly immoral. Betraying people? Mostly immoral.[1] Now the same holds true for sexual strategy. A woman claiming on the pill while she's not in order to get pregnant? Mostly immoral. A woman lying about her partner count? Mostly immoral. A woman cheating in a committed, exclusive relationship? Mostly immoral. A man raping a woman? Mostly immoral. A man claiming to be single while he's not? Mostly immoral. A man cheating in a committed, exclusive relationship? Mostly immoral.**tl;dr: The use of guns can be immoral while guns itself are not, business practices can be immoral while businesses are not, and the application of sexual strategy can be immoral while sexual strategy is not. The phrase "sexual strategy is amoral" is missing the point at best and a diversion tactic at worst.**Let me end with a quote from TRP, which prompted me to open this discussion. The context is the concrete example from above, with a man pretending to be in an exclusive relationship with 10 different women. /u/lifelongbeta points out the how horrible that is and gets this reply:&gt; Sexual strategy is amoral. Plenty of women manipulate guys to their advantage. Yes, many of us don't like it, but do we fault them for it? No. It's in their nature to be machiavellian.&gt; &gt; We are not being hypocritical. In fact, if you read the lessons learned section, you will observe that no one put a gun to these women's head forcing them to date John. They chose to do so. Men and women today need to be cognizant of players and lying whores.&gt; &gt; [Source to thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3b2cpu/man_dates_ten_attractive_women_gets_caught_shrugs/)  [Direct source to comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3b2cpu/man_dates_ten_attractive_women_gets_caught_shrugs/csi7zul)No, no one put a gun to these women's head forcing them to date John. But he breached contract. He claimed to be exclusive but wasn't. I will not defend the morality of a "lying whore", so why are you defending the morality of a lying player? ^[1] ^Exceptions ^include ^"in ^self ^defense" ^and ^the ^likes. ^We ^can ^almost ^always ^find ^a ^small ^number ^of ^exceptions ^in ^the ^assessment ^of ^the ^morality ^of ^any ^situation, ^a ^popular ^example ^would ^be ^denying ^to ^hide ^Jews ^during ^the ^holocaust ^when ^the ^Nazis ^are ^knocking ^on ^your ^door ^searching ^for ^them. ^That ^doesn't ^make ^lying ^right ^in ^99% ^of ^all ^other ^situations.

Just so I can get the 4-1-1 on the latest PLL theories.
2zxo0n	-60420	1427054604	PrettyLittleLiars	5x23 and 5x24 Hints!	Hey! So if I remember Marlene tweeted about how the last 2 (or 3 i think...) episodes have a lot of clues involving Uber A's identity and I was just wondering if anyone has gotten the chance to study both episodes 5x23 and 5x24 and have anything that could lead to A's identity.
2zzfb8	-60420	1427088369	PrettyLittleLiars	Thinking About How Long PLL Has Been Airing...	Ok, so this is has more to do with the series in general than the episode that is going to air in less than 48 hours (about i think?). So PLL aired in 2010 and in 2010 I was just about to enter middle school. It was especially hard for me because I had just moved away and I had to make new friends.5 years later and I am a sophomore in highschool. Thinking about it PLL has been in a huge part of my life, huge as in most of my life where I actually develop a voice for myself. Just thinking about that blows my mind and then I remembered there are also 2 more seasons to come, which means it would have been with me all throughout high school. I cannot believe how PLL has affected my life and how much it has shaped me as a person. Anyone want to share any way that PLL has shaped them?
302h1z	-60420	1427151555	PrettyLittleLiars	Question about the doll house...	Ok! So I get that the Liars get kidnapped and all and are drugged or something and pass out and end up in this lifesize doll house. The only thing I don't get is how does A kidnap Hanna? I get it's easy to get the other 3 Liars because they are being transported to a jail after the trial, but Hanna is already in jail, how does A just break into jail and kidnap Hanna? That seriously makes no sense to me.
303aez	-60420	1427165714	TokyoGhoul	Help With the Anime!	Ok, so I understand the rootA has been going in a different direction than the manga. I want to watch the season finale that I believe is going to air Thursday. I can't catch up to rootA (yes sounds absurd, but school!) in the little time that I have so I was wondering if someone could tell me all the changes they made to the storyline? I already read the whole manga so I'm not worried about spoilers but I really want to watch the finale of rootA so can someone please fill me in?

3dp4yq	-60420	1437187462	stevenuniverse	Little Idea About The Gems...	Ok. So I was just thinking about the gems. I remember reading something about how Jasper was the basis for Amethyst and Kindergarden. And then how Pearl is kind of a less advanced version of Peridot. Both being used for work and "office" tasks. And then I was thinking about how Lapis uses water and wondered if there were any other gems like her. Then "Keystone Motel" happened and it showed how Ruby used heat and Sapphire used ice. I barely know where I'm going with this, I just was thinking about how possibly there are classifications to gems. So there are 3, maybe 4. Amethyst and Japser fall into a warrior classification. Peridot and Pearl fall into mor of an... Just secretary-ish thing going on. Especially with both Pearl and Peridot being able to connect to the space ships. And then Ruby, Sapphire and Lapis can control elements. I'm not sure what kind of classification they would fall under but they are similar. Just thought I'd put it out there, I don't expect anyone to really respond or anything... But thanks for reading if you did! :D

When looking at the %DV, I see that almost everything on there is over 200%, and the recommended dose is two pills. Is it bad to cut that down to one pill a day? It's still 100%+ DV and, you know, lets it last twice as long.

Any idea what endgame will be like in that regard?

I'm thinking of ones that look like [this](http://www.theshootersbox.com/store/images/flashlights/coast_led_flashlight_TT1012.jpg), with all of the LEDs behind large glass lenses, and no reflecting mirror.So, why is this done?

And if there are a few planets like Earth out there, there might also be life."

15pygr	-60432	1356955436	Warhammer40k	First (mini)game batrep, advice welcome	By mini game I mean a decked-out Grey Knight Strike Squad played by my wife, and my Grey Knight Terminator squad, both about 320 points.**Wife Squad*** GK Justicar, MC Nemesis Force Stave, MC Storm Bolter* Storm Bolter and Nemesis Force Daemonhammer* 2 Psycannons* 6x Storm Bolter and Nemesis Force Halberd* Psybolt Ammo**My Squad*** Justicar terminator, Storm Bolter, Nemesis Force Halberd* 7x Terminator, Storm Bolter, Nemesis Force Halberd**Turn 1**She won initiative, so I recommended she move to about 24" of my termies. She did so, and she placed them accurately. For her shooting phase, most of the storm bolters hit and she utilized her Justicar's MC, but none of them got past my awesome save. In hindsight, I totally forgot about the psyammo, though I'm not sure it would have made much difference. Her Psycannoneers turned to me, both hit, both wounded, and I rolled snakeyes, damn, removed two termies. I lost 25% of my unit, and I barely passed my morale check. She was out of range of assault, so my turn.I moved my guys up, then decided to take a few potshots at her. I rolled poorly on everything, and none of my 6 shots made it past her armor. Out of range of assault.**Turn 2**I recommended she didn't move toward my guys, so she shot again. This time her storm bolters were a bit more effective, taking out one of my men, while her psycannoneers didn't make their shots count. Again, forgot about the psyammo.I moved, and decided to move through the shooting phase, and got a nice 6. Close enough now, I rolled my 2d6 charge, and got a 4 (ouch), but it was enough! Brushing off her poor Overwatch I charged! Getting my 15 dice ready, I roll quite poorly and I only get two wounds, which she saves one. Finally, my first kill, right? Nemesis force warding stave time! She saves that one too. I manage to shrug off her Halberd attacks, but the Daemonhammer crushes my last remaining front-line termy. Seeing as she won the assault, I make a morale check, and of course lose. I fall back, we roll against each other. She beats my roll by 1, and takes the remainder of my squad in a sweeping advance.**Results**10 decked out GKSS didn't lose a man while taking out 8 Terminators. Did I make any grievous errors? Is this just a fate of dice, or does that seem right to you?
15vk8f	-60432	1357195739	flashlight	Why are there no high-end 9v flashlights?	There are a bunch of cheap snap-on ones, but nothing built to last it seems. I thought LEDs liked high voltage. Edit: It seems that google is my friend. Evidently, once again, current is significant. [This thread](http://www.candlepowerforums.com/vb/showthread.php?347255-Why-are-9-volt-battery-flashlights-the-only-ones-that-keep-an-LED-on-for-years) says that even 50 mA is too high for our friend the 9v. They only hold about as much energy as a  AA anyway.

It sounds awesome - I think what makes most people wary of BattleTech is the speed of things. Lance-on-Lance combat can take easily 1-2 hours in my experience, while in the same amount of time some Warhammer guys have wiped out entire companies. Quick Strike seems like what I'd like, but I haven't had a chance to play it yet.

My hands were cold, so I grabbed a pair of (currently freezing) hand warmers from my car survival kit. Shook em up and threw em in my gloves. Ten minutes later, I swear they were colder than when I began, my fingers were tingling and starting to hurt. Then I read the package: [Little Hotties can take up to 20 minutes to reach maximum heat.](https://www.littlehottieswarmers.com/product/hand-warmers). They were finally warm about 15 minutes after I started using them, albiet just barely. I think I may try a different brand of hand warmers, and I know to prep them (aka, not throw several ounces of subzero pouch in my gloves). Now I have a priority: Test everything in my survival kit.

1d5zc4	-60432	1366997589	flashlight	Review of 3 AAA lights: Streamlight Microstream, LED Lenser P3 AFS P, Pelican 1910	I like 1xAAA lights, and have quite a few. Unfortunately, I dislike twist switches, so this limits my selection quite a bit. Fortunately there are still clicky lights, and here is a short review of the three I own.**LED Lenser P3 AFS P**Pros: Brightest of the three, best color of the three as well, focusable beam (something many LED lights lack), clip has a flat spot on the body underneath - makes clipping it easier.Cons: The beam focus mechanism (sliding the head back and forth) is way way too loose - it just flops around. Clip was nearly impossible to put on - I had to use pliers to widen them a bit. Worst of all: The switch is insanely easy to turn on - I ran many batteries nearly dead while it was on in my pocket.Rating: 3/5**Streamlight Microsteam**Pros: It pushes light out the front.Cons: Dimmest of the three, worst color, the clip scraches the body unless you pry it out, the switch is nearly impossible to depress with just your thumb - my thumb pops unless my hand is at just the right angle, very little bezel - the lens was scratched after just two carries.Rating: 1/5**Pelican 1910**Pros: Very solid construction, button is just right as far as resistance goes, good light and color, only clip so far to be screwed on with the cap.Cons: Similar short bezel but not scratched so far, clip is a little hard to attach to my pocket though I could probably just bend it out.Rating: 5/5, highly recommendedNote: None of these had intensity control, but for a 1xAAA, I'm happy with max brightness. Also, most of these were pretty inexpensive.Product Links: * http://www.ledlenser.com/flashlight/keychain-size/p3_afs_p* http://www.streamlight.com/product/product.aspx?pid=144#tabs* http://www.pelican.com/lights_detail_specs.php?recordID=1910

It has four medium lasers. _Wowwwww_.I feel as if I'm missing out on a good portion of the game by writing them all off, so what's my cognitive dissonance?Edit: Just would like to compile all your excellent advice:* Higher speed = Higher to-hit* Superior numbers due to lower BV/C-bill cost* Instead of combat roles - Recon, spotting, EW* Expendable * More maneuverable - force your opponents apart, get at least one unit into a rear arc* Cost per assault 'Mech, weapons per cost* Forcing initiative - using superior speed to make your opponent react to youThis has been eye opening, thanks everyone. Need to look at light designs again. I think part of my problem is I'm more of an engineer than a tactician - I can design flaws away; I can't do that to multi-unit combat. :)

I'm looking for a script or single exe that I could put next to a folder, then either run it or drop a folder on top of it, and it would make Everyone the owner and only user with full control.  I know how to do it, but when I type up a tutorial with all the steps and contingencies and OS versions it's 20-30 steps.EDIT:So icacls shouldn't be used to take ownership. takeown can't specify users accounts, just current user. That being said, seems like this works okay:    Take Ownership.bat    ::%1 is Copied folder    if "%~1"=="" (      set target="Users"    ) else (      set target=%1    )    echo %target%    takeown /r /f %target%    icacls %target% /grant Everyone:(F) /t /c /l /qI'd still prefer to have Everyone be the owner.

Honestly I overdo assaults, so I wanted to try my hand at a heavy.For an IS 4/6 standard engine, endo internals, mostly full armor, the ideal weight is 75 tons. Locked the chassis and tried making some variants.I discovered that you can basically take any IS 'Mech from 65-85 tons and cram it in there. The only one I really couldn't do was a JagerMech, because of the lack of armor on the original chassis and the fixed heat sinks on mine.Let me present to you: The MERC-O Mercenarius    Mercenarius MERC-O        Mass: 75 tons    Tech Base: Inner Sphere    Chassis Config: Biped Omnimech    Rules Level: Tournament Legal    Era: Clan Invasion    Tech Rating/Era Availability: E/X-X-E-A    Production Year: 3052    Cost: 7,327,031 C-Bills    Battle Value: 1,006        Chassis: Unknown Endo-Steel    Power Plant: Unknown 300 Fusion Engine    Walking Speed: 43.2 km/h    Maximum Speed: 64.8 km/h    Jump Jets: Unknown        Jump Capacity: 0 meters    Armor: Unknown Standard Armor    Armament:        30.0 tons of pod space.

123yl4	-60445	1351227588	TwoXChromosomes	I'm a male cheerleader.	I'm not really a cheerleader but I came here tonight to give a cheer to all of you ladies who have been putting up with so much crap at the hands of some of the more ignorant members of my gender. I am a follower of Twox through my wife who is a regular part of your community. As this election campaign progresses, women are coming under greater attack from what I truly feel could devolve into an American Taliban. As the husband of an accomplished woman and a father of another, I fear for the future of women. If recent events haven't provided sufficient evidence that we are in a culture war that has the goal of taking us back, not decades but centuries, then you have been asleep in a cave. I see a greater threat to our way of life than could be presented by any foreign enemy. We have crossed the line that separates fringe lunatics from a dangerous political and social movement. We all need to be fearful. I ask you to call on your husbands, boyfriends, SOs, fathers and brothers to vote for women's rights and freedom, to send a message. There is no greater or more important issue today. Not the economy. Not Iran. Nothing!If you are a Democrat, voting for the kinder, gentler philosophy of President Obama will not be difficult. If you are a Republican, it might be more difficult but it is necessary. I was a life long Republican until ten years ago when I saw the party being taken over by radicals intent on a social revolution where they push their religious and social beliefs down our throats. If you are a Republican you need to send your party a message that if they don't moderate, they will lose everything. You do this by voting against them in Presidential and Congressional elections. What is happening is no small deal. You, as a woman, stand to lose more than the right to control your body. Just as moderate Republicans were afraid to stand up to the Conservative fringe in the past, they will continue to stand back and let the social revolution happen in exchange for not being challenged in the next primary. Don't let this get out of hand. Now is the time to stand up for your rights and the rights of all women and girls.I'm sorry so many of my gender just don't get it. Your job is to make us understand, to get us to take this assault on your rights seriously, and to get your men to support you in this election. Get us to the polls and tell us how to vote and why it is so important to you.I get it. I hope that you do, too! Vote for women's continued rights, freedoms and opportunities. Take a friend to the polls.

(Comments follow)	Historic fabric refers to more than the building's materials and includes such things as lighting that show visitors what it was like in the earlier era and the view scape. If the ghost is associated with the house's history and I do something that drives the ghost out, would a historic preservationist consider me to be damaging that historic fabric!

I swear, WTVY channel 4 in Dothan, AL must have a serious brony on staff because time after time they've done news stories on the phenomenon.  Here's a few examples:http://www.wtvy.com/home/headlines/Seeds-of-Success-Brony-Fundraiser-Reaches-Another-Goal-185248242.htmlhttp://www.wtvy.com/home/headlines/--Another-Brony-Charity-Livestream-Brings-Interviews-and-Thousands-for-Causes-188790511.htmlhttp://www.wtvy.com/news/headlines/Online-Brony-Herd-Census-Reveals-Facts-Stats-About-Adult-My-Little-Pony-Fans-199802371.htmlhttp://www.wtvy.com/news/odd/headlines/Bronies-New-Documentary-Looks-at-My-Little-Ponys-Unexpected-Adult-Fans-187701961.htmlhttp://www.wtvy.com/news/headlines/Meet-the-Bronies-209486431.htmlhttp://www.wtvy.com/news/odd/headlines/Enterprise-Brony-Shares-Fan-Art-of-My-Little-Pony-209640761.htmlA piece on bronies would make a great filler for a slow news day, or with the right angle an uplifting story for the end of a newscast.  But this local news station has so many, I have to wonder what's up?  Does anyone know?  Do they have a brony for senior news editor?  Is the producer a pegasister?  Anybody have any idea what's the rap here?(Edit: fixed typo and tried to space out the links better.)

1oxksk	-60467	1382392361	mylittlepony	My furlough spree was not pretty, but it's what let me hang out with some bronies	During the recent U.S. goverment shutdown, I was furloughed for nearly 3 weeks.  During this time, I was finally able to attend my college's Brony club meeting.  This is what I found.Some of the folks were weird, some of the folks were cooler than buck, and most of the folks fell in the middle (like average people.)  The leadership was chill.  They were calm, professional leaders who loved the show.  The club had been asked to put together a campus "Spook-alley" for halloween for kids, and it went without saying: with no pony stuff.  While organizing it and taking ideas from the members, lots of times the weird folk threw out pony-related ideas like pinkamina, but each time they were shut down gently but firmly.  I would have been tempted to tolerate it for fear of hurting feelings, but the club leader handled it great.We watched an episode, "A Bird in the Hoof", and the comments that were spoken during it were intelligent and improved the experience.  This was infinitely better than what I feared: loud, obnoxious comments.We had a readers theator with one of the IDF comics.  While I haven't been at all impressed by the comics, the reading was fun.  I volunteered for Sweetie Belle, and even achieved a couple voice cracks at times.  I was pleased some others caught on.In the end, I was impressed by the experience.  I like the show first and foremost, and this meeting actually enhanced my love of the show and characters instead of being, like much of the fandom is to me, a side thing that detracts or stands aside from my love of the show.  It wasn't weird, it wasn't costumed, it wasn't awkward, it was chill, professional, clean, and positive.Thank you, good Bronies.  Thank you.tl;dr -- I met up with a college brony club.  Not only did it not suck, it was a very positive experience.

Hi, I've always been told I have a good reading voice, but I'd like to put that to the test.  I read children's books aloud to young kids and even took part in a competition once.

29pgmp	-60467	1404354675	mylittledota	I will not be satisfied until Rarity delivers me my items.	Ok, the post title is something I said to myself soon after Dota 2 was released into semi-open beta.  But it's gotten to the point where Pony models imported over the default courier should be doable.  Dota Cinema does this fairly regularly--importing (somehow) custom models that they and their folks have made.In this thread, I will document my findings of how viable this is and what it would take.  Please contribute if you know anything.

2nowcp	-60472	1417203304	crossfit	I have sort of plantar fasciitis...	I've always had a tight posterior chain, especially my calves, and anytime we do agility drills or jumprope to warm up (anything where I'm flexing and jumping off with the balls of my feet), my plantar fascia aches.  Feels like a muscle cramp almost.  So If I get in early enough I can stretch and roll everything out and it's usually ok.    Other than crossfit it never hurts... so doesn't quite sound like traditional plantar fasciitis to me.Enter oly shoes.  I just got some some Fastlift 335's and they've made a nice difference in my front squats and snatch.  But did a metcon with thruster and burpees last week - my feet ached so much I had to stop and change shoes.  I also got uncomfortable doing Grace in them.  Anyone else fight this?  More stretching?  More lacross ball?  I probably should see a podiatrist, but aren't they just going to prescribe inserts?

Her family lives down by American Fork and she wants to be closer to family (we have a 2 year old), and it'd be great to get more house for our money. What's the general vibe of SLC?  I know things have been changing rapidly over the last few years.  How's the school system?  Are there cool restaurants opening up or are they chains?  Do you still have to buy your scotch at a state-run liquor store?  How would a liberal atheist fit into the community (FYI the in-laws are all right-wing and Mormon, but we get along swimmingly).  Fun cultural things to do?  If anyone has lived in Los Angeles and could compare that'd be even better.  Biggest question, even though we both work in niche industries, what's the overall economic situation there?Thanks! 
2p09df	-60472	1418329973	serialpodcast	I knew a sociopath	Latest podcast got me thinking....thought I'd share how easy it is to be fooled: My buddy, call him E, has an older brother D.  He must be about 43 years old.  Anyhow we had never met D for years.... E always mentioned he had caused problems with the family and pissed everyone off so they sort of shunned him.   At some point the parents forgave D.  D was out of work, had nowhere to live, and moved back in with his parents.   We all finally got to meet him.  D was actually quite a nice guy.  Seemed he had turned himself around.  He would hang out with us on a Friday night, be part of boardgames, and would even babysit E's son.  He was intelligent and funny.  Everyone thought he was back in the family for good.  Great!Turns out he's a pathological liar.  Here's a sample of the things that slowly began happening.  He had a job for a brief time, but was fired.  Of course he would leave the house everyday to "go to his job."  Until his brother E called one day to talk to him and found out he had been fired.  D got involved with a girl who he convinced he was a pro baseball player for a MLB team.  She had minimum wage job that he convinced her to quit and then then got her a "job" doing personal assistant type things for his father who was a lawyer.  Naturally D was her only point of contact with the law firm.  He promised her she'd be paid well "next week."   Then the parents were going on an extended european vacation.  D told this girl his parents had died in a tragic plane crash and he'd need her to help him have the estate sale.  She got suspicious and called the law firm.  The brother E got wind of the plan and, of course, D was immediately shunned from the family.   He hasn't been heard from since.  It's been a couple years. Just goes to show some people can totally fool you.  I has zero inkling this guy was a sociopath.

But sometimes I outrun them.  And sometimes I outlift them.  And sometimes I finish first in the WOD and get to cheer them, chuffed with my victory. But I'm always a little sore, my knees ache, my back aches, I'm not getting nearly enough sleep with a 5am class, a kid, and a shitty commute. I desperately need a rest day after 3-in-a-row. Somedays I just have an empty gas tank and the WOD demoralizes me. But thanks CF.  I was the opposite of fit 2 years ago.

2z72wv	-60472	1426476853	Thetruthishere	Black cloaks of Boston	I've got 2 mildly interesting stories from about 17 years ago, though I've pretty much discounted them entirely in my old age. I went to Boston University and studied filmmaking.  At some point during (I think) my sophomore year I had gone out on the Esplanade to record ambient sounds at night.  The Esplanade is a park that lines the Charles River - winding sidewalks, trees, grass, open space. I had a Nagra tapedeck, a few different mics, windsocks, the works.  It was pretty late as I recall, no one else was out, and I wandered around getting wind sounds, river sounds, etc....   I finished a recording and stood up to decide where to walk next.  Down the path I started making out human shapes.  5 or 6 of them, maybe a few hundred feet apart, standing off to the sides of the sidewalk, not moving.  They looked dressed in complete black, with hoods.  I froze and watched.  They didn't budge.  Walked 20 feet and stopped to watch again from another angle.  Nothing.  Walked a long distance and watched again.  And even though I was in bustling city on a very public park, I got very frightened.   I beelined it back to school.Notes: it was obviously night, and my memory is faded, but it must have not been *that* dark as I was wandering around without a flashlight.  It was a public park and must have had lights scattered about - plus the ambient light of the city.Next year was living off campus. We had been drinking a *lot* of Aftershock.  My roommates pissed me off and I barged out of the apartment to get away.  Wandered down the street to a small park that was on a hill: http://goo.gl/5NnCFP  I laid down on the rock that you see dead center.  Stared up at the stars for a bit which was very frustrating as I was seeing double. Perhaps passed out for a few.  Something stirred me and I sat up.  Down at the bottom of the hill there were maybe 10-15 people.  All just standing there. All dressed in complete black and what looked liked hoods.  Again I just froze and watched.  They weren't doing anything except standing there like statues.  I started getting serious Rosemary's Baby vibes and noped out of there - going over the backside of the rock and slinking out as quick as possible. Notes: was hammered. Perception poor.  Probably some fraternity scavenger hunt.... in the middle of the night.... without flash lights
320pfr	-60472	1428599952	crossfit	Chronic lower back tweaker	All my adult life I've had a problem with tweaking my lower back.  Lifting something wrong, playing with my kid, getting drunk in a bar and (well, don't remember how it happened.)   Naturally in my 2 years of crossfit I've tweaked my back lifting poorly.   And while I've almost eliminated my lifting problems, I tweaked the hell out of my lower back doing box jumps yesterday.   We did deadlift as strength training.  I was at about 60% 1RM.  Everything went great.  WOD had a "high" box jump.  So I warmed up to 36" and then did 4 at that height for practice.    Sure enough, 1st jump I must've got overzealous, and PING.   I have a feeling the deadlifts pre-loaded me for failure?  Anyone else deal with this?  I think I'm going to reduce crossfit classes for a month and start yoga.  Never done it.   I've been seeing a PT who comes to our gym and she says I have a very tight posterior chain.  Hamstrings are like bowstrings.  I've got excercises to help, but I think I need more.

Several camera angles followed, never showing the actual road collapsing, just dirt skidding down. I suspect the producers ordered that some dirt get dulled down the hill and they dug out the road. It's nothing new that this show is becoming scripted, just an observation i had on the topic. Still a fan.

2emjhv	-60474	1409060721	ottawa	A couple questions from first-time home-buyer in Ottawa.	Hey gorgeous people, my wife and I are soon moving into out first home after 6 years of renting. I've notified cable and hydro of the move, so that is fine. But our rental unit was water-included and electric everything, so gas and water/sewer is new to me. I've registered an account at ottawa.ca and nothing in the water/sewer section tells me how to begin getting a water bill. Are water bills automatically and continuously mailed to the address, indifferent to who is actually residing there?Also, looks like Enbridge is the gas monopoly in Ottawa, that's the way to go is it?

2g80de	-60474	1410546246	Cartalk	Mazda 3 - broke bearings or something else...	I have an '05 Mazda 3, 2.3L hatch.   So I was accelerating up an on ramp in wet conditions and got some wheelspin . There was a wide cracking running across the ramp and both spinning wheels but it simultaneously with a big jolt. No immediate noise, but in the days since, whirring noise getting louder.  I'm pretty certain it's both bearings, I've had a few replacements with different cars and am familiar with the sound. Noise doesn't go away on left or right turns, but changes slightly. Is there something else that could have been stressed and broken after an event like I described? Also, I know there's alot of labour involved with the pressing of bearings. Is it cheaper to get the hub/bearing assemblies online (rockauto - $50 each) and bringing those to garage to avoid this labour? My quote after tax is $615.

2ifzyj	-60474	1412600743	photography	I was contacted by a company, asking what I would charge them to use my image on 1000 decorative cushions.	They sell the cushions for 15-20 pounds. Even if I ask for 5%, that equates to CAD$1345.00 on the low end, which seems too good to be true. I don't want to piss 'em off with my first reply. I'll also find out if they pay right away, or they pay on a per-cushion-sold basis, but what would you suggest? Anyone with this type of experience?edit: [this pic](https://500px.com/photo/21696781/snow-day-by-michael-higgins?from=user_library)

This is a follow up to my [original post on the subject](http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/2ifzyj/i_was_contacted_by_a_company_asking_what_i_would/?sort=confidence) TL;DR Company asked to use my photo to print 1000 cushions. I offered it for £530,they countered £300,I went back with £350 and omitted the exclsivity.Ok, we settled on that. Then they said in the latest email that they would maybe like to make 5000 cushions, BUT they want my cost to remain £350. so, they talk me down to £350, followed by hey, now we want to make 5x the profit using your photo, but don't want to pay for it. Now what? My photo is what will sell the cushion! This can't be common practice for licensing agreements.

3cqzor	-60474	1436493550	WeddingPhotography	Getting started with presets.	I don't use presets, maybe only because I'm not familiar with them.I know what they do, I know they can be downloaded, or that the can be user-created. But do they have the same end result on an overexposed photo and then an underexposed photo? Are they *that* smart, or does a set have to be pre-edited to similar levels, followed by preset application? I'll experiment on my own of course, I'm just looking for some starting knowledge while I'm away from my computer.
3e40dr	-60474	1437508703	Lightroom	Crop with the "L" key.	I learn and forget so many keyboard shortcuts, but in Lightroom 5  always use the L key when cropping. One tap darkens all of the panels, a second tap blacks out everything except the photo. The crop overlay (shortcut "R" key) can then be moved around by mouse or arrow keys, and resized, with zero peripheral distraction, for the perfect composition. The third tap brings everything back into view. Hopefully this is an undiscovered trick for some of you.

The peril that the SEALs find themselves in is so contagious.

3i9k05	-60474	1440458872	catcare	Dinner for two	Hi. My wife and adopted another cat because our current 10 month old, Bandit, is in obvious need of a wrestling partner. We found a perfect match at the humane society; also a male, same size, same age, same appetite for rough-house type play. We named him Smokey... Smokey and the Bandit :) Aside from the movie reference, his fur color lends itself to the name also. Anyways, they are currently in the separation phase, with Smokey spending most of the time in the alone room, with brief swaps here and there. We are wondering what to expect after this phase, when they are both living throughout the house... What happens at feeding time? We've read alot of dos and donts, but what are some of your personal feeding experiences? Thanks!
