I ordered a dab rig, which they failed to ship the nail with. When I called them and told them, they kept me waiting three days, then sent me a glass nail. The rig needed an 18mm ceramic nail, so it didn't fit. I then called them again, and after a week of waiting, they promised they would send me the nail and free compensation. I just today after two weeks recieved the nail, and to no surprise, no free compensation at all. Don't waste your time, ents.TL;DR: The Smoke Cartel failed to ship me a nail multiple times

I need to smoke it everyday to even feel normal. When I wake up in the morning, the first thing on my mind is smoking weed. In my years and years of smoking, I've tried so many times to take a break, and only gotten as far as two days. So although some people, particularly overzealous novice pot smoikers, want to say marijuana isn't at all addicting, clearly in some cases it can be. What are your thoughts, r/trees?

1f86rd	-20027	1369778264	exmormon	Advice for paying own way through secular college?	I'm graduating from high school this year having been a closet exmormon for over a year now. My older sister (a closet exmo as well) is finishing up her schooling at BYU and her experiences there as an exmo have been terrifying, to say the least. Over the application process, I purposefully got myself rejected from BYU so this would not even be an option available to me, as I know that I would have been forced by my TBM BYU alumnus parents.I got accepted to my dream out-of-state school with extremely reasonable tuition compared to pretty much anywhere.After many arguments and calls to the BYU admissions office about how the "school of the lord" could have rejected me, they have allowed me to go to my out-of-state college for a year and they will pay for it. But only for the one year. After that, they claim that it is financially necessary for me to transfer to BYU. (interesting sidenote: my parents are in the top 5% of taxpayers. They are adamant against any loans.)I am very grateful I have this one year paid for so I can have a cushion for transitioning. After this year, however, I will have to be completely financially independent if I want to continue my secular experience, which I do.I need help from someone with knowledge and/or experience here for help with my game plan. Secular education is an absolute priority to me. I want to make this work through any means possible.

However, I'm confused about their sizing, which suggests a 32 band size for an underbust of 30" and they don't carry a 30 labelled bra.

They tabulate all of the major websites' weekly projections and score each one based on how accurate they were after each week's games.

One key point to mention is that with keepers, Rice, Mendenhall, Forte, McCoy and McFadden are already off the board, so I'm potentially giving up the chance for a top QB. I was considering taking Brady with the 1.11 pick since I'm assuming Rodgers and Vick will be gone by then. Again, b/c of keepers. So what do you think FFReddit? Should I bite?

We'll be there for a week before the actual surgery so we want to get as much of a taste/feel for the city as we can before we're hospital bound.* So far the list includes* Skyline Chili* Graeter's Ice Cream* The Zoo* Newport Aquarium* Frisch's Big Boy* LaRosa's Pizza**edit:** Thanks for all the advice! For those that asked, our daughter is 3 years old, so stuff like the art museum and even the Carew Tower might not be big hits. Will definitely check out the butterflies in Eden Park and Montgomery Inn.**edit #2:** Wow! Thanks to everyone for the input. I sat down with my wife and she wants me to tell you guys "Thanks" as well. So summarizing the list, here are the things we've added:* Goetta dog* Montgomery Inn* Eden Park* Jungle Jim's* Cincinnati Museum CenterThanks again for your input!

I know both fapping and porn are addictions for me. I've once gone more than a year without giving in to either temptation and want to get back there. What's helped me in the past is having people that I have to look in the face and give an honest answer to the question, "Did you give in?" Glad to be a part of the community, /NoFap.

I've recently been playing LoW and have been trying to figure out how you'd be able to get more than 5 and have it work well. Has anyone tried this? What changes to the setup have you tried? For example, we'd need to have additional buildings, but which ones?

I know that sounds like a dumb question but our league has a keeper policy that you can keep any player you drafted but you have to use a draft pick two rounds earlier than the round he was picked in the previous year's draft. I picked him up in the 11th round this year so I'd have to use a 9th round last year. I was hoping he'd turn out to be Cam Newton, but fantasy-wise he's the opposite (low fantasy points, still wins games). Thanks for the input.

1hcjav	-20040	1372564527	booksuggestions	Looking for a new series that really draws you in to the main character(s)	I've recently come to realize that I rarely read stand-alone books. I'm almost always drawn to series. I tend to draw towards stories with a few main characters or story lines in the fantasy/sci-fi genre: Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Ender series, Dresden Files, Codex Alera, Sherlock Holmes, etc. Not a huge Game of Thrones or Hunger games fan. I like my main characters to much :) And I can't get into Wheel of Time because that series is just TOO massive. I did just start branching out into other genres with The Lincoln Lawyer series and enjoyed those.

Saying good game isn't about bragging about how well you played or commenting on the quality of the game. It's about showing good sportsmanship and not sulking because you lost. So what if your AD carry fed? So what if you lost because of a certain team member? Saying good game is about thanking the people for playing with you and showing no hard feelings.  Please don't say "bg." There's no point. It doesn't change the game or your team mates. All it accomplishes is making people feel badly./rant**TL;DR:** Saying "bad game" is bad and if you say it, you should feel bad.

1i9c4q	-20042	1373775909	Yogscast	A thank you to the community (I just found this subreddit)	I have been a Yognau(gh)t for quite a while. I started watching Lewis and Simon around 4 years ago. I got started on their Aion preview videos and from there expanded to their Warcraft how to videos. Needless to say I thought they were hilarious (despite the how to videos not being very informative) and continued to watch their videos daily. I've never been a very active member of the community, despite being such a giant fan. However I want to thank all of you for being so supportive of them. I don't know what I'd do with myself if I didn't have new Yogscast content to watch every day, and I'm sure a lot of you feel the same way. There will always be bumpy moments when people will get upset over small things such as the 9/11 joke, (which personally, I thought was funny and not in bad taste) it's unavoidable for entertainers that put out as much content as the Yogscast do. However it's the true fans that make it worth doing, so thank you again for your support.TL;DR - Thanks for being awesome!

I've been playing quite a bit and I realize that many people will say "just playing" is the best way to improve, however I was wondering if there were any communities dedicated to inprovement. When I started playing DotA, there was a reddit community of players of all skill ratings that setup in-house games to help new players improve. The better players would give advice on where to ward, when to rotate, and other meta strats that aren't necessarily intuitive to new players. Does anything like this exist for the csgo community?
2qgkeb	-20042	1419616221	CSGOCoaching	One of the main things I need help with is the meta aspect of the game	I played a lot of css 10 years ago, had over 2000 hours on my main account. However all of that was surfing, wcs, bunny hop and the like and I never really got into the classic 5v5 objective games. That being said I have a pretty good grasp on the mechanical aspects of the game while I'm completely lost when it comes to the meta. I've been playing a lot with a higher tiered friend (he usually floats around double AK where as I'm nova II) and he has explained buying strats to me fairly well (save rounds, ecos, etc.) but there are still some other things I struggle with. How long should I wait to rotate? When 2 people show themselves? When 3 people show themselves? Is it better to wait until you see someone rushing to smoke, or should you smoke preemptively to prevent the rush? Are flashes better for taking sites, or for defending them? These are the kinds of things I've been having a hard time learning.

qlqay	-20051	1331129705	glutenfree	Just Got Blood Labs Back, Looking for Insight	Hello all,For basically all my life I have had terrible, constant heartburn. I went to a GI doctor about 5-6 years ago and had an upper GI scope for suspected Acid Reflux. He said he saw irritation, but no structural reason why I should be having heartburn all the time. I was prescribed Prevacid.Upon taking the prevacid for the first time, I realized that I had no idea what it felt like NOT to have heartburn.Now, 7 years later, I have been constantly taking Prevacid. I never went back to the GI because I went to college/forgot about it and just kept taking the pills.I decided I didn't want to take pills for this anymore (they are a considerable expense) and set out to figure out how to fix this.I tried eating more healthfully, sticking to whole grains and minimally processed foods. While I felt somewhat better, I still felt generally tired (which I have all my life) and the heartburn was ever present when not taking pills.Then I read that many people diagnosed with Acid Reflux actually have a food allergy or intolerance, most commonly dairy or wheat.So I tried eliminating dairy from my diet, with no effect. Next I tried eliminating wheat/gluten. The change was dramatic. I felt better just in general. I realized I had also been experiencing a fair amount of bloating and diarrhea that I had just assumed was normal. After about a month of being gluten free I felt better than I ever had before.My friends and family were skeptical because I have been trying various diets for years in an attempt to deal with these symptoms (Atkins, vegetarian, pescatarian). So they assumed it was just another phase in my diet exploration. They encouraged me to see a doctor to get a real medical opinion, so I did.About 4-5 days before my appointment, I started eating gluten again because I read that if you don't eat gluten, your test might come back negative even if you have celiac. This was terrible, I hated it, A LOT.Now I've gotten my lab results back, and the celiac panel came back negative. I was, however, vitamin D and B12 deficient (they told me to start taking supplements). I've also scheduled an appointment with a GI, which will be in about 3 weeks.Regardless of what happens I know I will never ever go back to gluten, unless it is for some kind of testing purpose. The difference for me is night and day. I don't have to take any type of antacid AT ALL now, this freedom is amazing and I can only imagine how much money I wasted on pills for heartburn over my 24 year life.**tl;dr I had constant heartburn/other gastro symptoms for my whole life and think I may have celiac; labs came back negative**What are your experiences with being diagnosed, and what should I be pushing for them to do or ask the GI when I go? Additionally how possible is it that I got a negative result because I wasn't eating gluten for a long enough period of time?

And then I "concentrate" really hard, and either it takes a few tries to get the thing to happen, or it doesn't really happen at all.I believe this comes from some kind of doubt that what I want to do is possible. Because I am too strongly rooted into realistic physics/expectations, I can't easily break them in dreams.Has anyone else experienced this? Is it possible I wasn't actually experiencing a lucid dream? (it sure felt like it, and some manipulation was possible)

u32g8	-20051	1337881594	Diablo	What I Suspect is the Real Cause of the Account Compromises	 Here are the facts:- Blizzard has said the number of compromised accounts are actually VERY LOW in comparison with total population.- Session ID spoofing is technically impossible.- No cases of authenticator breach have been documented.Despite the wild rumors flying around, there is not one case in which someone who said they had an authenticator BEFORE the compromise has not been proven to be lying.So here's what's really going on:Diablo 3 is the first major game released by blizzard since wow that gold farmers and gold selling companies will have the opportunity to profit from.Account compromises in WoW ramped up slowly over the years as these gold selling companies began to spring up and as WoW gained popularity. Therefore the level, frequency, and timeline of account compromises in WoW was seen as "normal."Without a doubt, gold sellers have been preparing for this launch FOR MONTHS IF NOT YEARS. Collecting all the data they can manage to get their grubby little hands on.When WoW was first released, none of these companies existed in this large of a fashion, nor were blizzard games as highly targeted or profitable for gold sellers as they are now.Gold selling companies likely collected data from:- Fake diablo 3 beta giveaways- Real diablo 3 beta giveaways that required a login to join (whether sold to GS by 3rd party or directly)- Keyloggers (which would have been collecting data for a LONG time before being detected because there were no accounts yet to compromise)- Whatever other trickery they use/phishing emails etc.So here are the GS companies with likely MOUNTAINS of login information.Now what do they do? They wait until everyone has had a chance to amass enough wealth that it is worth harvesting a SMALL portion of the data they have collected. Of course they can't get to anyone with an authenticator, but they can still get to a good number of people.Their only goal (as evidenced by people witnessing compromises) is to amass as much gold as possible in as little time with as little effort so that when the RMAH goes live, they will be ready to take control of the gold selling market.This has happened so "hard and fast" because they have literally been preparing for months. There is no security compromise.That all said, don't let all this fear mongering make you believe that you are helpless and that nothing can be done about it.Get an authenticator.From the blizzard store: http://us.blizzard.com/store/search.xml?q=authenticatorFrom the Play Store (Android): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blizzard.bma&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDMsImNvbS5ibGl6emFyZC5ibWEiXQ..From the apple store: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/battle.net-mobile-authenticator/id306862897?mt=8Change your password regularly, and remember that passwords are not case sensitive in Diablo, so use some numbers and symbols!TL;DR: Gold companies have been planning to take your shit for months; blizzard's security is fine aside from not having case sensitive passwords.

For instance, with shields its very easy to tell which is which tier because of the block value (larger block value, higher tier)But for the others I sometimes have trouble (although I realize you could just look at the armor value)It would be neato to have a cheat sheet with all the icons on it if someone would be willing to compile!

v3p26	-20051	1339780669	Diablo	Gameplay Style: Why I Find Some Parts of D3 Unfun	Yes, shitty affix combos suck, yes there are some other things about the game that are poorly designed/annoying.But this is the real problem I have with the game design:The gameplay style sucks.Now this is coming from someone who plays (and wants to play) about 85% solo for progression.I play a Monk. I'm currently farming Act III and am capable of killing inferno Diablo.Here's my main complaints:- Melee take forever to kill things without insane gear- Ranged can't get hit more than 3 times tops (usually closer to 1)That isn't fun. For anyone.The only way that the game is fun is if you have a well geared/balanced group of friends to play with, and I greatly enjoy that. BUT. I think everyone should be able to solo the game given good gear.My husband plays a DH and he dies so much that it completely kills my desire to ever play a ranged class until survivability soloing is addressed in ranged classes./rant
v83s9	-20051	1340029339	Diablo	I'm Calling it Now.	In 3-4 months, maybe sooner, melee will be overpowered and ranged will be QQing.As a monk who has completed all of inferno with semi-decent gear (only amazing/unique piece is a string of ears with 18%), I can guarantee that a few months from now melee will be facetanking everything without ever dying, and ranged will still be getting one shot by bad combos.People who are having trouble with act 2/3/4 right now just don't have the gear yet. But as more perfectly rolled pieces make their way to melee players, and the upcoming inferno nerf it's only going to get easier for melee.EDIT: Since some have asked:[Time Played](http://imgur.com/slX1h)[Gear + Stats (completely unbuffed)](http://imgur.com/tzyFf)[Build](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/calculator/monk#aigXYk!XYU!acYbca) - Sometimes switching out for Evasion/Hard target depending*Note that 1h mace is only for additional life on hit while dual wielding.*Note from Raykhan about attack speed:"It alternates, each weapon is independent of the other. Each consecutive attack uses the alternate weapon, so each consecutive attack uses the appropriate weapons speed.This is visible in the stat window by simply attacking with it open if you have two weapons of different speeds. You should see your attack speed swapping back and forth between them."Lastly, just for the record, I'm not a jobless college student. I have a 9-5 job working at a desk all day (which allows me to browse this subreddit) and I play evenings and weekends I would say fairly casually. I spend most of my time playing with friends, and worked on progression whenever I felt like I could handle it.
vbuip	-20051	1340201791	Diablo	Change to Illusionist Affix?	I hopped on last night and did some farming post-patch and I was super excited now that I could finally farm actual monsters for loot instead of stupid boss runs.Loaded up Act III, and found myself in Icefall caverns.I was merrily romping through the dungeon when I happened upon a champion Possessed (fat undead guys who explode and flies come out).It was something like Illusionist Knockback Vortex maybe... Plagued.So I run up, and all the fat guy minions and main fat guy do their illusionist thing, no problem, I've got sweeping wind going to take care of them.Then suddenly, all the illusions start exploding, and every single one spawned 3 flies! After all is said and done the real minions are at 1/4 health and the champion has lost about 1/3 of his health just from the explosions of their illusions. Luckily I had my trigger finger on serenity or I would have been toast.Now I don't recall illusions behaving like this in the past with the notable exception of those mobs in A2 that burst open into poison after you kill them.**tl;dr Undead fat guys who have illusionist affix are now (or maybe have always) creating illusions that explode like the normal mobs do also spawning their insides items (eels, flies, imps)**Can anyone confirm how fat explody guy illusions functioned pre-patch?
vbw4g	-20051	1340203687	d3hardcore	A Warning About Illusionist Undead Fat Guys	Every time I encounter something absolutely ridiculous on my Softcore monk, I always think of my hardcore toons and how lucky I was they weren't there.So this time I will take the opportunity to warn you HC redditors.I was in A3 Icefall caves yesterday and encountered a pack (the only affix I remember was Illusionist) of undead exploding fat guys (the kind that explode after you kill them and release some kind of monster from their guts).Ok no biggie, the other affixes were benign.I go in and begin killing, illusions come out, begin to die... and then explode like normal mobs.While this wouldn't be a big deal, it was a champion with 3 minions, so in total there were probably 16-20 illusions all exploding at the same time.In one way, it was helpful because they damaged their real counterparts (to the tune of the minions only having 1/3 hp remaining), but if I had not hit serenity when I did, it would have been disastrous.Each illusion ALSO spawned it's "guts" monsters (in this case 3-4 flies from each corpse) and each illusion dropped gold/sometimes items.So fair warning, illusionist fat guys are dangerous!EDIT: As an update, I made a similar thread in /r/diablo and through discussion it seems to be that it is ONLY this type of fat guy that behaves like this. This type is called Possessed and spawns in icefall caves in act 3. I don't know if they spawn anywhere else.
vbzop	-20051	1340207470	Diablo	Share Your New Favorite Farming Spots!	Now that the farming style has mostly shifted, everyone should share their new farming routes!My personal favorite (for now) is act 2. Typically I set it to Black Soulstone, and go to a few areas where I know elite packs spawn (Alcarnus, Oasis, Ancient Path) and I make sure to clear any dungeons I find as well! They are guaranteed to have 2-3 elite packs if multi-level plus a chest or goblin most of the time.I also tend to run through the Kulle blood caves, as they typically have 3-4 elite packs as well.Once I've worn myself out farming elite packs, I kill Kulle and Belial to mark the end of my run.I can farm A3, but it seems to be much slower than farming A2, with more frequent (but still rare) deaths. Once I get a little more dps, I imagine I will work my way back into farming A3 proper.
vfxmu	-20051	1340383841	Diablo	The State of "Endgame"	Meowtlandish the monk here! I have almost zero desire to play Diablo 3 right now, and that makes me very sad.I want to want to play the game, but it's just so hard when it isn't much fun.I beat diablo pre patch and once more post patch just to be sure I could still do it (it was a bit easier as his damage is decreased).So what do I do now? Play another class? Whats the point? Here are the main things keeping me from continuing on in any significant fashion:- I was farming A3 pre-patch, and now the droprates are just abysmal, no fun to be had here doing several runs to get a few sellable items and gaining gold to do... nothing.- I know I will not find any gear for myself due to the loot structure. Boring!- Maybe I should play hardcore? Well, only if I want to farm goblins all day and still not find any loot for myself ever, and run the risk of losing my character to lag/disconnect.I tried. I really did. I even leveled a Wizard to 60 normally, and leveling was fun because I could absolutely destroy enemies, although the loot still sucked. Then I played about half of act 1 inferno and realized there was nothing to do.So in conclusion, unfun game is unfun. I'm really disappointed in Blizzard for... well most everything. I'm glad I got the time out of the game that I did, but it could have been so much more. Unfortunately, they decided to design the game in a way that would maximize their profits from the RMAH, and it ruined the aspects of the game that should have been fun (killing loads of monsters and getting sweet sweet loot).If you haven't killed Diablo inferno yet, take your time, because I suspect after you do, you won't have much motivation to play anymore.
wfuqv	-20051	1342099567	redditguild	Just Wanted to Introduce Myself (Aquanaut)	Hi everyone!I just joined last night and I wanted to start off by saying I think you are all lovely people. More than I could have ever hoped for and exactly the type of atmosphere I was looking for.I thought it might be appropriate to introduce myself and give a little background history.My name is Courtney, I'm a 24 year old female living in Ohio with my husband, a dog named Buddy and a cat named Boba Catt. I work a 9-5 where I stare at word documents all day, but it is fun and pays the bills. I like zombies and cake, but please, not together.My character's name is Aquanaut, 85 Shaman. I also have on another server (Horde) an 85 Mage, Paladin, Hunter, Druid and Rogue. In my long history with WoW I've played every role.I was a scheduled raider from mid vanilla until Firelands. I took a break just before Dragon Soul came out, and now I've decided to return with much more casual aspirations.I'm a tad bit rustier than an old car left outside all winter, but my reflexes are slowly returning to me.Currently my shaman can heal, enhancement dps or elemental dps/elemental pvp.So feel free to hit me up for groups or BGs, I'm here to have fun! Oh, and I'm always down for achievement hunting or running old content for mounts etc. So if you need people for those, let me know.

Hi all,I've been telling myself that I'll start doing keto for about 3-4 months now, and I just keep failing.I feel like I know what I'm supposed to eat, but at the same time I don't.Every time I start keto, I end up craving something that I shouldn't be eating and then all of a sudden I'm not doing keto anymore. I tend to trick myself into eating things I shouldn't because "I've been doing well" even though I haven't actually lost any weight.What are everyone's strategies for avoiding cravings and how long does it take before those cravings start to lessen?Things I know:- Eat bacon- Eat vegetables (leafy green types are the best)- Fat is your friend- Drink a lot of waterWhat usually trips me up:- Rice (I can't eat gluten so this is my replacement for bread)- Sweets- Not feeling like I have something in the house to eat that is filling enough/ not going shopping for produce often enoughI'm sorry as well, as I'm sure this type of thing has been asked and answered a few times, but I'm really looking for some personalized help here.I know I have the self control to manage this, but I think my educational level is lacking.Thanks in advance!
wp586	-20051	1342528287	glutenfree	What is the one tip you would give to a new to GFer?	I think my tip for her is going to be that while there are gluten free breads, I much prefer just making a sandwich with lettuce for bread, which works with most everything except PB&amp;J.Compilation:- Find substitutes for things you like, but know that they are going to taste different and embrace it.- Udi makes the best gluten-free bread. Period.- Carry some substitutes with you (snacks and such)- Cooking is fun!- Always have a plan- Don't be afraid to ask questions when going out- There are GF substitutes for EVERYTHING- You will get better with time/practice- Watch out for sauces! Especially in Chinese cuisine, soy sauce has wheat in it (although there are gluten free soy sauces)- Find me Gluten free app- You can always find something GF at a restaurant even if they don't have GF menus. Some things are just naturally GF unless someone decides to screw it up- Always ask if beef patties are 100% all beef, sometimes they fill with wheat- Fries can sometimes be coated with flour to enhance crispiness, always worthwhile to ask- You can find most restaurant's menus and nutritional guides online making it easy to plan before you go out- Always read the labels, and beware of [hidden wheatwords](http://celiacdisease.about.com/od/copingwiththediet/a/Gluten-On-Food-Labels.htm) and [sneaky products](http://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/gqx9v/im_new_to_this_any_tips_on_sneaky_products/)!- Find substitutes where you can, but try to find new things to love that are naturally gluten free! Some processed food type "replacements" that are gluten free are still not very healthy for you!- Oats in the field are gluten free, but most of the time they are processed on equipment also used to process wheat. Do not consider oats gluten free unless specifically stated/certified- Get a rice cooker! They are cheap, convenient and rice is your friend. Sushi rice with some salt is one of the best things ever.- Quinoa is delicious and pretty.- When in doubt, don't eat it.- Even if your intolerance is "minor" as in, your symptoms are not terrible if you get glutened, *DON'T CHEAT*. You are ripping up your insides every time you do.- Beware of Gluten Judas (the glutened kiss)

xidb6	-20051	1343835826	atheism	I just watched an episode of Disappeared about Madalyn Murray O'Hair. Why the fuck didn't anyone look for her and her children?	[For those who don't know about her.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madalyn_Murray_O'Hair)Short version: "She filed a lawsuit against the Baltimore City Public School System, in which she asserted that it was unconstitutional for her son William to be required to participate in Bible readings at Baltimore public schools."The lawsuit effectively banned mandatory bible readings. This was in 1960.She then became a sort of atheist celebrity and was very blunt with her opinions. A lot of people (especially those super religious) absolutely hated her.She and her 2 adult children disappeared in August of 1995. It was speculated that they ran off, even though Madalyn's medication was left behind and their dogs were left alone in the house without a caregiver.A missing persons report wasn't even filed until **a year** after they disappeared, and even then cops scoffed at the idea of actually looking for them stating they didn't want to look for people who "didn't want to be found."The case was finally built up thanks to a newspaper reporter (John MacCormack) and a private eye (Tim Young). When the PI went to the police with his report detailing what he believed through his research happened to the O'Hairs, it was ignored by both the local PD and the FBI.The bodies of the O'Hairs were finally recovered in January of 2001, **six years** after their initial disappearance. They were kidnapped by three men, two of which had serious criminal records.David Waters beat someone to death with a fence post at the age of 17, had charges of theft and beat his mother and urinated on her. He also stole $54,000 from American Atheists and got off on probation.Vanity Fair interviewed David Waters after the disappearance of the O'Hairs and he told them they ran off to New Zealand.I just don't understand this, and I would hope that if I were ever kidnapped with my entire family that the people of the world wouldn't hate me so much as to willfully not look for me."An Atheist is a person who has absolute confidence in their fellow men, and in their own ability."  -- Madalyn Murray O'Hair

If you have a weak password, this will not be difficult, and your account will be compromised.================================================**What you can do to secure your account:***-**Change your password to a complex passphrase.** Passphrases are, as they sound, phrases that you use to access your account. While a password is generally one word and some numbers like homework11, a passphrase is an entire sentence. Examples of good complex passphrases:Sometimes I like to poop my pants and Time Travel to 1985.Hackers are generally Soulless Raccoons with 99 problems but your email ain't one.- Notice the capitals and numbers present in each passphrase, as well as punctuation.**Create an email that will be used ONLY for GW2.**- Create a new email that is to be used only as your account email. Change your account email to this email. I highly suggest you do this if you have received a password reset email.Again, if you have received a password reset email, they KNOW that account is registered on GW2.com.Obviously, don't use this email anywhere else, or register for anything with it.If you follow these recommendations, you will have done a great deal to secure your account. A good complex passphrase is MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH harder to crack than a complex password.Hackers will have a severely difficult time compromising your account with a complex passphrase and dedicated email in place. Use of a Keylogger is essentially the only way to pull it off.**tl;dr change your password to a complex passphrase and change your account email to a dedicated email created only to be used for GW2.

11b5sm	-20051	1349965238	WowUI	Looking for a good super minimalist UI	Hi all,My UI is currently a mess, so I'll spare you having to look at it. What I'm looking for is a UI that is completely minimalist where even the action bars can be hidden. I use keybinds/mouseover for all my abilities, so seeing them on an action bar is not necessary.Basically I want to maximize my viewing area. Anyone know of any addon packs that I could start out with as a base for this?

13bk18	-20051	1353102790	glutenfree	Product Alert: Blue Diamond Nut-Thins	I was excited to see that my local grocery is expanding their gluten free section yesterday and found these crackers made with almonds and rice.They are delicious, which makes my next statement all the more sad.Although they say Gluten Free on the box, they are not certified (which I should really start looking for more) and on the back they state:**Processed in a facility that also makes products containing: wheat, pecans and hazelnuts.****Each production run is sampled and tested to confirm gluten levels do not exceed 20 ppm.**Unfortunately, I didn't read this before I ate them, and I had terrible GI symptoms, but I thought I might warn anyone else who might be looking at these on a shelf.Sorry if this information is already known, but I just thought I would share!

Unlike in minecraft, a small layer of water won't do.
1sb3lv	-20051	1386406262	starbound	Suggestion: Adding Depth to Farming	I love farming. And so far, I am really happy about the number of different growable plants etc in this game.**For all of these changes, I would rather see them implemented in a way that all crops are growable in all biomes on all blocks at a decent baseline, and then if you fulfill certain conditions, it improves it. Never detracts. That way farming will remain accessible to people who don't want to mess about with it, but can be more in-depth for those who want a challenge.**That all said, I see great potential to add even more fun stuff to farming! Here are some ideas:- It appears that leaving a planet halts crop growth on the surface. Perhaps the game could, upon your return, check your "time away" and apply it to the growth of the plants you left behind? This would give more incentive to plant on the surface/build bigger farms on the surface. (Thanks to arrabiatto for inspiration here)- Make crop growth vary based on what type of block it is planted on (cactus grows best on dry dirt, carrots grow best in mud, etc)- Fix seed production. Crops don't give extra seeds often enough. (If seed scanning into the 3D printer came back, or growth times were significantly lowered, this would not be an issue)- You can currently till blocks that are submerged in water, and plant on them, but from a limited test it does not seem to affect growth time. It would be fun if it did for some plants (like rice).- Similarly, being adjacent to standing water does not affect growth time. Would be fun if it did.- I have not yet tested if the planet biome affects growth rates, if it doesn't, it might be fun if it did.- Fruit trees!- Craftable hydroponic farms which give increased yields (possibly a hydroponic greenhouse upgrade for the ship?)More advanced ideas that might just be out of the scope of this game:- Crossbreeding to get plants that otherwise don't appear naturally.- Soil conditioning or fertilizers- An NPC who will tend crops for you on your ship (for a price)Fellow farmers, let me know what you think!P.S. Toxic tops aren't even toxic. Unless Florans are magical of course.

So I've been having some issues with crafting via AE (mostly it just stops randomly with no indication as to why or what it is doing via the crafting monitor)After a spot of research, I found this on the AE site:&gt;As of October 26th, I'll not be releasing a final stable version of rv14, because of some annoying crafting related issues that have come to my attention that did not exist in rv13, and I was unable to find them in a reasonable timeframe. If you are interested in playing with the new features and are ok with smacking the network to reboot it every so often, the build can be found http://ae-mod.info/dev/So now I am curious why the pack decided to go with AE build r14 over r13. The issues are pretty crippling (assuming you autocraft a bit), enough so that I have completely reverted back to Logistics Pipes for any critical autocraft operations (pyrotheum is how I fuel my base).I'm terrible at reading changelogs, so I can't tell what amazing feature might have been added going from r13 to r14, aside from spatial IO which is crashy/buggy and disabled anyhow.

And why does it taste so good?* The following movies should never have been made / remade: Clash of the Titans, Total Recall, Any Highlander sequels, Battleship* Most of my life lessons were learned from TV: 'The Electric Company', 'Sesame Street', 'Scooby Doo', 'Lucky Charms' commercials, 'JP Patches' and 'The New Zoo Revue'.* There should have been more music from 'Big Country'.* I flushed a toilet after my Dad detached it from the floor. I still remember the 'I knew you'd do it' look.* I should have danced more. Especially in the kitchen.* I cried a little when 'Wilson' floated away.* How do they get the soft, chewy caramel inside a Caramilk bar?* Dolly Parton jokes are still funny to me.* I've always wanted to race in the Dakar rally. * There should have been more 'Choose Your Own Adventure' books. Especially one that continues after you find 'Ultima'.* The following actor(s) should have received an Academy Award(s): Bill Murray, either for Lost in Translation or Caddyshack, almost the whole cast of the 'Back to the Future' trilogy, Jake Gyllenhaal for 'Donny Darko' or 'Jarhead', Simon Pegg for 'Shawn of the Dead', the guy who played the zombie in 'Porky's 2'.* How many raisins are there in a dollar?* I like mountains. (See the Dolly Parton reference above.)* I'll watch 'Waterworld' and 'The Postman' at any given time.* &lt;rimshot&gt; should have been included in the HTML 5 spec.* I've always wanted to paint a version of the 'Mona Lisa' in the keep on truckin' style. * I wish I could have had a house party like in 'Weird Science', complete with a blue kitchen.* Every time is 'Peanut Butter Jelly Time'!* I wanted to see the Vancouver Canucks win a Stanley Cup. Just once :(So, if the Flying Spaghetti Monster is turning us into sauce for his noodly appendage, at least I've had my say. See you on the other side! Peace.TL;DR: Random bullshit, nicely formatted in a bulleted list.

ors3o	-20064	1327262524	loseit_classic	Need help with motivation/Staying with it	So, I've been changing my lifestyle since the new year. I've been eating at or less than 1500 calories a day, all of it 'healthy' stuff like fruits, veggies, whole grains, etc. I've been exercising at least 3-4x a week. I've  had 2 'cheat' days since I started, both where I had pizza. Last night, at a friend's house, I weighed myself and I was still at 192 lbs. I haven't lost any weight at all since I started. For some reason, This made me incredibly demoralized and I went on to eat fast food and cupcakes D:. I felt like all of what I'd been doing was for naught.Basically- I don't know what I'm doing wrong, or if I've just gained muscle and not lost any weight because of it, or what. I can't really do  the paleo diets or anything since I'm vegetarian, unless you guys have a veggie form of that. So what do you do to stay motivated?

I'm finally starting to feel human again, and I had a question for you guys:When do you think it would be 'safe' to start working out again? I mean, besides the obvious when you feel better :P. I mean more, how can you tell if you are ready to work out and won't just end up hurting yourself more than helping?I hope this makes sense. I'm still kinda loopy from being so tired.

Add chopped walnuts.-Cook those as normal-Cook fake eggs as normal-put some sugar free syrup on and you're good to go!**-Potato taquito with eggs and potatoes and hashbrowns**-whole wheat tortilla-fake eggs-make your own hashbrowns or buy frozen with low fat-cheese (optional.. I like to use soy or rice cheese)-Cook the fake eggs as you would normally-bake the hashbrowns in the oven-warm the tortilla in the same pan as the eggs were cooked in-put the cheese on the tortilla in strips (i only use one slice), then add the eggs and hashbrowns-and then put some salsa on and you're good to go!

re7wf	-20064	1332771951	bipolar	A favorite sonnet of mine	So this sonnet is probably my favorite of Shakespeare's. To me, it says that regardless of your flaws, you are the light of someone's life, and that they love you regardless. That there is someone out there who will treasure you for who you are. And I try and read it when I'm in a depressive phase to remind myself of these things.Sonnet 130        My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;        Coral is far more red than her lips' red;        If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;       If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.       I have seen roses damasked, red and white,       But no such roses see I in her cheeks;        And in some perfumes is there more delight        Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.       I love to hear her speak, yet well I know        That music hath a far more pleasing sound;        I grant I never saw a goddess go;        My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.           And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare      As any she belied with false compare.Anyone have any other poems or songs that help you through a depressive time? Share!

He is already house trained and has no problems there, and is correcting his chewing problem wonderfully. However, he is terrified of his crate. I tried luring him in with chew toys/treats, but he either won't fetch them or will pull out the bedding to get to them. He basically refuses to get into the crate period, and I've no idea what to do with him since he's my first dog. So I have some questions:- Is 1 year to 1 year 6 months too old to try and crate train a dog?- Any crate training tips on how to get him more comfortable going in the crate when he refuses to go in on his own?-Anyone want to guess what breed he is for fun? :D [this is him](http://i50.tinypic.com/mvksnn.jpg)

Day 3: the bruise has spread around the entire area where you fell. However, let's say you hit your shin on your bed frame. The bruise shows up that day, and begins to fade by night time.

And I LOVE having it long, but lately I've been curious about some things..Pics of the hair beast: [front view](http://i.imgur.com/2Jwdy.jpg), [back view](http://i.imgur.com/CY5Gi.jpg) (yeah, i know i need to de-clutter my counter)1) Since my hair dries wavy/straight, would a 'natural perm' be good for curlier hair? I prefer my hair curly but I'm not sure of the route to take for that.2) I've been considering getting some longer bangs for a while ([like this](http://hairstyles-pedia.com/img/arts/2010/Jul/16/3/hair_layeres.jpg), but I'm not sure it would go well with my face etc.3) color. It dries into a darker brown with blonde-ish highlights, but I've been curious about maybe getting some dark red highlights. 4) Last but not least.. how do you take care of your hair. I mean- how often do you deep moisturize it, what products do you use for that, what kind of leave-in conditioner do you use, shampoo, etc. 
waddp	-20064	1341864766	AskReddit	Because the douchiest thread is incredibly depressing, let's talk about nice stuff. What's the nicest thing you've seen someone do for a stranger?	I think the nicest thing I've seen someone do is save a dog and child from a locked car in summer. I'm in Houston, so it gets really, really hot, especially during summer in full sunlight. I was going to a Wal-Mart, and when I got into the parking lot there were cop cars/ambulances/etc. and a man talking to the police. I asked a spectator what was up, and they said the guy talking to the police officer had called them when he saw a child and dog locked in a car in the parking lot, and then proceeded to wait by the car for ~10 min till the police got there to break the kid and pet out. I thought it was incredibly nice of that man, and it made my day.

I'm going to try and post more here, it's just been a stressful time.So, I have a rant. And I'm going to curse, and rave. I hate you. I fucking hate your pathetic excuse for an office, and I hate how incredibly, awesomely incompetent all of you fucks are there. Seriously, you didn't call in a prescription for a bipolar patient YOU KNOW is on a steep decline because you **fucking forgot**? Are you fucking kidding me? No, really, are you joking? Or are you doing this as a way to get off on a power trip on people you consider more pathetic because they have mental disorders and have to go to you for help? Because every time I've gone in I sure as shit feel looked down on. And my fucking psychiatrist was an hour late to my appointment why? OH WAIT you guys never fucking told me why. You just said 'hey, will you see this other lady you didn't even know worked here with a male doctor that you'll be super uncomfortable with since you were brutally assaulted as a kid?" And what was I supposed to say? "No, I'll wait another two hours and make my boyfriend miss his doctor's visit as well". I had to say yes, and then you, you fucking douchecanoe piece of shit forgot my fucking meds. I'm done with your office. I'm just 100% fucking done. I hope you all the best, but I really hope you learn how to treat your patients with respect and actual fucking dignity. And you. You are supposed to be my friend and try and understand what I'm going through. But to say something like "I know bipolar is a neurological thing, but, I really sometimes wonder how you can be unhappy in the situation you're in". WELL, I WONDER TOO BRO. Hold on, let me count my blessings so my bipolar will magically drift away into oblivion, never to bother me again. OH WAIT. That's one of the reasons I hate myself the most: because I know that I do have a wonderful, privileged life full of people who care about me and advantages I know are fucking amazing. And do you think for a second I WANT to throw that shit away because my brain is fucked up? Can you honestly think that I sit here and say to myself "hmm, I have a boyfriend who loves me and a nice place to live... let's fuck it up by being unhappy all the time just because!". No. I've woken up every fucking day for the last week and a half wanting to die. When I wake up, I literally think "Well, fuck, I didn't die in my sleep. That fucking sucks." Today, thank the gods, I woke up thinking that I wanted something sweet, and the thought of suicide was only my second thought. And that's an improvement. I'm sorry you don't see how incredibly pathetic that makes me feel, that having suicidal thoughts as my second waking moment in a day constitutes an actual **good day**. But instead, I'll just let you sit there with your misguided opinion of bipolar, because quite frankly I've been crying enough as is, and I want to die enough as is, and revealing just how fucked up I am inside to someone would take a toll on me I don't really want to pay right now. Like, do you really think I wouldn't change the way I feel in my head if I could? Do you really think I don't see all the shit that is going well for me, and hate myself for fucking it up? Just, damn./endrant

yoxhm	-20064	1345724790	SRSWomen	No, really? Really, shitlord? [TW for harassment]	This is going to be a rant. It may not be all that long, as I'm still getting used to my fake nails and typing is kinda a pain in the ass.Yesterday, I went grocery shopping. I was minding my own fucking business, when a shitlord decides to harass me. Now, first let me explain- down South where I live, you generally smile at strangers or occasionally say hi. I don't know why, you just do. And I'm fine with this, as I like being nice to people and not making their days shitty. So I'm walking to my car, and I smile at some random dude walking by me. And he smiles back, all is good, until he says "Nice rack, b**ch". I had to stop for a sec and think about if he actually just said that. I literally stopped in the middle of the parking lot, and I assume he took that for a good thing because he started approaching me, leering the whole time. Which is when I clearly said "Go fuck yourself" and practically ran to my car.Now, my question is: What the everloving fuck does some random bro think while saying to a woman "nice tits". Not only is that completely unsolicited, it's also just.. I don't know. I don't have words for how incredibly skeezy and disgusting that is. And on top of it, it actually triggered me some. I actually had to fight off a panic attack because of this fucking shitlord just because he felt the need to objectify me in a goddamn Kroger parking lot.And this, ladies, is why I'm an ardent feminist. Because men shouldn't feel like it's their god-given-right to judge my body based on their arbitrary rules. Because I want to feel like I can go outside without being accosted based on my physical attributes. Because I don't think **any woman** point blank should have to be objectified based on her body by some creepy bro.

But I can never seem to just relax and meditate while practicing like I've heard many of you can. My mind simply runs in a million places and I get impatient and anxious and then call it quits after half an hour. And I know this is due, in part, to my ADD. But I also think I've never really been able to just focus on the task at hand by having a transition from everything else time to yoga time.So any tips for beginning practice to focus on simply your body and the poses you're doing? Any poses that might help with this? Or even just tips for meditation I think would help.Thanks in advance!

15i1n2	-20064	1356579730	MakeupAddiction	Help! I need makeup recommendations (specifics in post)	Ok, I know next to nothing about makeup. I only know my eyes sometimes get red and watery from some eye shadows, and not others.With this being said, I received 2 gift cards for christmas: one to neiman marcus and one to dillards. Suffice to say I can buy quite a bit with them.So, my questions are:1) In your experience, what are the "best" (smoothest application, better quality, longer wear, etc) brands from these stores?2) What is the fanciest product you like from there?3) Are there any 'necessities' that I should get? (Keep in mind, I have maybe 2 mascaras, an eyeliner, some lipgloss, and i think one lipstick. and eyeshadow primer.)4) any recommendations for foundation that is light and doesn't cake?[this is an awful pic of me, but you can see my skin tone/face shape/etc](http://i.imgur.com/cE8rp.jpg).

1atnyd	-20064	1363987504	Pets	My cat is having trouble jumping (details inside, yes she's going to the vet on Monday)	She's 1 year ~3 months old, approx. 13-15 lbs. My SO and I noticed yesterday she was having trouble jumping up onto our desks, which is HIGHLY unusual. Throughout today, I've seen her make smaller (~1-1 1/2 ft.) jumps, but nothing more than that. I'm wondering what could have happened, as I haven't seen her fall or anything recently but then I haven't been around her 24/7. I inspected her for cuts, felt her bones  (GENTLY) for breaks, and looked on her gums for possible scrapes. Her temperature is fine and she doesn't seem to be in any pain at all, and still wants to be picked up and petted. It's literally like her back legs have no power to propel her upward. I'm really worried and wondering if I should just take her to an emergency vet sooner, or wait till Monday?Thank you in advance!EDIT: Forgot to add, she can focus fine on objects, like our hands if we wave them or a lazer like playing tag. She can hear things fine, and is responding well to any stimuli we are attempting on her. Her nose is also cold and we like usual. She literally seems completely normal except the jumping. It's really weird, and worrying. =/

1dn0t3	-20064	1367611619	SkincareAddiction	Got my first haul (pic inside) and have some questions..	So, to preface this post, I am a noob at skincare. I don't actually have a 'routine' yet, but I am going to start one ASAP, hopefully with my new purchases + the stuff I already have.1) I have acne prone, mostly oily skin that flakes after I put on proactiv occasionally (which I use for my acne).2) The haul I got today was [this](http://imgur.com/Zufm7Tn): CeraVe foaming facial cleanser, CeraVe moisturizing cream in the tub, and Tree Hut Shea Sugar Body Scrub (for my legs).3) I already have the proactiv line of stuff (the facial scrub, the toner, and the after cream), and I have [this Chantecaille mask](http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/chantecaille-detox-clay-mask-with-rosemary-honey/3102977) that was a Christmas gift that I use once a week. The mask I like- it makes me skin feel firm and supple after wards, and the proactiv has kept my acne at bay since I was a teenager (23 now).So questions:1) What should my 'routine' be? I know you wash your face in the morning, but do you moisturize after washing and before putting on make up (yes, I'm also a make up noob)? With the products I got, how could I balance the proactiv + CeraVe- as in, would I use CeraVe in the morning and proactiv at night, or viceversa? 2) I would simply use the moisturizer over the proactive cream right? Or would the moisturizer replace the proactive cream?3) When taking off make up, do you use a make up wipe ([like this](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/makeup+remover+cleansing+towelettes+-+night+calming.do?sortby=ourPicks)) and then the CeraVe, or one or the other?I'm sorry this post is so horrifically long :( I just have never done anything with my skin before, and really need the advice. Thank you to all who braved the full thing!Help me /r/SkincareAddiction, you're my only hope
1ebvxm	-20064	1368556370	hiking	Training for long term hiking/climbing goals - I want to start but am not sure where/what/how/etc.	Hello /r/hiking, my first post here and I'm looking for some advice or articles please!I've absolutely loved hiking my whole life, but it's really only been a minor hobby. The most I've ever done is Enchanted Rock ouside of Fredericksburg, TX, but I've always wanted to do more. So my SO and I planned a vacation to climb Quandary Peak this coming weekend (yay my first 14er!), which got me thinking: why not take this hobby where I really want to go? I want to climb mountains, and am going to. But first, I must train!That being said, I hope this is the right subreddit for this. Basically: has anyone here started from practically nothing and if yes, what was your sort of schedule? I was going to just jump head on into a climbing gym (because lol living at sea level) and running schedule but figured I'd ask here before I did something stupid and accidently hurt myself.Also: I'm basing my goals [off of this essentially](http://highest-mountains.findthedata.org/#guide), and wanted to get to the 3rd endurance point by this time next year.  I did google this by the way, but all that came up were really advertisements for books and things, so I was hoping I could get some practical advice or anything from you guys here.

1n4tkj	-20064	1380145841	SkincareAddiction	Questions about philosophy products/my regular routine	I've been a member here for a while, and have gotten a basic routine down sort of. However, lately (as in the last couple of weeks) I've noticed my skin being.. weird. It's both more oily and more dry at the same time (t-zone is oily, around my hairline and eyebrows is dry). I have no idea why this is, as I haven't changed anything recently. My routine was this for the last couple of months:A.M.: Wash with ProActiv cleanserPaula's Choice 2% BHA liquid tonerCeraVe moisturizerPeter Thomas Roth Uber-Dry Sunscreen SPF 30I don't usually wear foundation so that's about itP.M.:CeraVe Foaming face wash (the green bottle)I always thought my face was a total oil pit, except when I went to MAC a few weeks ago the SA commented she thought my skin looked dry (!!). So when I went to sephora today, I asked about their skincare stuff, if they had any moisturizers they would recommend, etc. and the SA gave me a samples of Purity Made Simple and Take a Deep Breath by Philosophy. So have any of you guys tried either/both of these, and did you like or hate them? And what else would you recommend for my weird skin? I can provide pics if requested of my "problem" areas.

However, I didn't get a card or anything? Is that normal? What usually happens with VIB? Is it just more sale stuff (like 20% more frequently, etc.)? I tried searching for this but a lot of it was for VIB rouge which I would need to spend *a lot* more to get (so lol give me like a month).Essentially, [I have no idea what I'm doing but I think I like it](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/i-have-no-idea-what-im-doing-dog.jpg)!

The first is when I just woke up, washed my face, and slapped on some moisturizer. Yeah, sorry, but it had to be done. And no other makeup because laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazy.Then the foundation + primer. I used Hourglass Mineral Veil Primer (that shit is also amazing btw) and MUFE HD Foundation in N115. I used a beauty blender I got at CVS for like $2 which did the job fine I guess. I don't have an actual BB to compare it to so you'll have to take my word.AND THEN THE POWDER. OH YESS. I'm not sure the amazingness comes through in the pictures honestly. When I put it on, it's like my pores just sort of blur out. I can't believe I went this long without it. And it isn't just smoke and mirrors or magic, I promise.

Here's a before picture from Sunday: http://imgur.com/kaLgG0dAs you can tell, they're just meh. I haven't filled them in, and they're sort of all over the place. So I decided to go get them done at Ulta which has a Benefit Brow Bar. The lady that did my brows, Taylor, did a wonderful job IMO, and then concealed around them using Benefit's Fake Up. She filled them using Benefit's Gimme Brow, but the best part was, *she didn't pressure me into buying anything*.

1eqxen	-20065	1369113661	Fallout	Question for 360 Users	So I lost my NV Ultimate Edition disc a year ago and since then have upgraded from the 360 to the 360S. As you may have guessed, I lost all my DLC's. My friend, in an effort to help, copied all the dlcs from his hard drive to a flash drive, and I then copied them to my hard drive. However, they don't load in the game. They copy fine from the flash drive but when the game loads after "loading downloadable content" some message about corrupt DLC comes up and they don't load.Here's the weird thing. This method worked for him giving me Broken Steel for FO3 (I had all the others and was missing just that one, I forget why) but it loaded fine for FO3.Any ideas? Thanks!

As far as the story quests go, I'm on the one where you have to steal whatever from the big barge guarded my maryweather security. I chose plan B and have already done the 2 quests to get the submarine and the chopper, and then I guess I must have selected a new quest or something because I now have no way of getting back to the main quest i was on.For mission progress it just says "kill the juror" even though I completed the Franklin mission to kill the four jurors (I did complete it fully, I believe. I finished it by killing the last guy, the one on the motorcycle, and then called Lester.) Even though i'm supposedly done with that quest, the mission pane still simply says "kill the juror" no matter what I do or which character I play. My friends suggested dying and respawning to fail the quest but that doesn't do anything as I already completed it within the time limit. Lester also doesn't answer his phone, none of the 3 characters get a call or anything when i switch around to them.Is my game bugged or did I skip some step or am I forgetting something obvious? Thanks in advance for any help.

Hey guys, I'm not too knowledgable when it comes to building or upgrading computers, but I'm trying to upgrade my mac's RAM from 4GB to 8GB. I know, I know, I'm using a mac. It wasn't my first choice of computer, but I know that upgrading mac ram is thankfully just about the easiest upgrade and the machine is well equipped for it.I have two main questions.**First**) There are 2 ram slots in the bottom of the computer if I'm not mistaken. I know the machine currently has [4 GB 1067 MHz DDR3] but I don't know if that is 1 chip or two. Basically my question is if I'm upgrading from 4 to 8 GB, do I only need to buy one 4GB chip because there's already a 4 down there? Or is it using 2x2. I can always open it up to find this out my self just wondering if that is common knowledge.**Second**) I know that Macs are a bitch to upgrade and are unneccessarily expensive, which is why I'm wondering if you can use any 4GB ram stick in an iMac, or if apple has some weird monopoly and you have to use their shit. If I can use any 4GB stick, does anyone have a recommendation of the one/ones I should buy?Sorry I'm inexperienced with this, but I'm eager to learn and want to be as helpful if possible. Let me know if you need any other information. Thanks!

2a0w2p	-20065	1404708865	techsupport	[WINDOWS 8.1] Quick question about storage across multiple drives?	Hey guys, I just set up my new laptop this week and have a question about storage. The computer has a 120GB SSD that the OS is configured on (leaving ~85gb on the SSD for whatever I chose) and a 7200RPM 1TB HDD for everything else. My question is, since the program files and "program files(x86)" folders are within the OS files on the SSD, and these hold most of the software I install (games, etc), is there anything I can't put on the 1TB HDD?So, because the OS is on one drive, can I not put, say, most of my steam games on the HDD but a select few I want increased performance with on the SSD? I might have explained this poorly, let me know if you have any questions, thanks!

2ahy96	-20065	1405153965	trees	Bad Trips? My story, want to hear others.	A few weeks ago I split and ate the larger half of a 100mg oil peanut butter cup with my buddy. We later concluded that the butter must have melted mostly on my side because he was fine but I was quite the opposite.Things started out as you would expect, awesome. We ate them and then had some food before walking over to my buddy's house to play Titanfall. It's then, about 2 hours after eating them that I begin to feel uncomfortable. I've been rising consistently and have reached a point I'd rather not be at. Everything was amplified, every bird call and lawnmower and cell phone ring. I could hear the neighbors through the walls of my buddy's house and theirs. My tongue felt really heavy in my mouth, and i was very aware of its presence and weight on my teeth. My head was spinning and ringing intensely for about half an hour before my stomach started feeling uncomfortable. After a while I stumbled into the bathroom and spent 2 hours hunched over the toilet throwing up and moaning from the pain. It was more mental than physical, but it was truly a nasty combination of the two i had never experienced. Eventually I passed out on the bathroom floor and woke up 3 hours later when everyone but my buddy and my girlfriend (who had been taking care of me) left. I guess it doesn't qualify as an OD, but I took a dose that was much to high for my tolerance/body (6'2" 142lbs btw, really skinny). I've never heard of this happening to people I smoke with, and the post today from the guy eating an entire batch of edibles prompted me to make this thread.Any similar experiences?

1xbz45	-20078	1391833022	mwo	PSA: Disconnected mechs must be killed for a win now	I've already encountered since the patch, but a match tonight really drove home how important it is to keep it in mind while playing. Here we are at the end of a match and the final outcome:[http://i.imgur.com/lRU3EiR.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/lRU3EiR.jpg)[http://imgur.com/P1eJ5jI](http://imgur.com/P1eJ5jI)So we lost (or tied) because a single disconnected Spider that did zero damage was hiding somewhere among the buildings on River City Night. The reason that time ran out was because it was a really close match - our blue team started on the north side of the river where the raised base used to be and moved to our right (west). At least 2/3 of the enemy team came from the east and started a big assault on our base which pulled us back and started an epic fight inbetween the buildings.The red team started taking a lead, chewing up our mechs with better coordinated fire (and maybe a bit of superior tonnage). I think they had 8 kills to 3 when things started to turn around. With the number of targets reduced we started to take the advantage and pick them off as they bumped into each other searching for targets in the dark. As you can see from the damage this was primarily 2 mechs; GridIroN (the player) in his Ilya had taken up a great sniping position on the upper level where the base used to be. In the dark he was successfully raining down big chunks of damage with his ACs on any mech that came into his line of fire, then fading before they could figure out what they where taking damage from.In my Jenner I was employing a similar strategy, constantly popping out from buildings to make surgical strikes to cut off arms, legs and finally killing blows. When it finally came down to just the 2 of us left I think there where 4 enemy mechs of which one died almost immediately to the focus fire from the two of us. Unable to conceal his position anymore GridIroN was forced to come down and started mixing it up face to face while I tried to support him. Unfortunately he was up against at least 2 assaults and another mech. I think he got the 3rd mech too, adding another kill to his score, but there was just too much attrition from the 2 assaults. I had been whittling down one and finally killed it but it was too late to save him.At this point some better match awareness would have helped - either through miscommunication or me misreading team chat I thought I was up against 2 assaults in my Jenner which had lost the CT armor and taken internal damage. With the enemy ahead and still capping there was a sort of team decision to go for glory. I headed in and ended up in a duel with their victor which still had all yellow armor. He was the enemy teams number 2 killer but evidently he was only good at picking on mechs his own size. At night fighting my black painted Jenner he just couldn't seem to get the shots on target. I think he would have had if he had a seismic module because I was relying a lot on misdirection to ensure he was aiming in the wrong direction each time I popped out for another shot, then got behind another building before he could properly counter attack.So it was a big sense of accomplishment but also a loss because I wasn't staying aware of the tab screen and didn't take into consideration the new disconnect mechanic until it was too late to do anything about it. But I think everyone enjoyed the match - apart from a little chatter from the red team directed at their victor for not getting in hits I don't think anyone was raging over the outcome. There was actually a lot of good sportsmanship over the open chat during the course of the match that you wouldn't find playing games like battlefield.So remember kids - killing disconnected mechs is no longer cheap or a waste of time and ammo. It might save your team the match!

When I say scout I mean those that are fast, a running speed of 9 or better (97 kph). I'm also more interested in types that would have been in reach of common units or militia garrisons, not ultra-rare models or one off prototypes. I've got a good start from my own sources but there are a lot of books I don’t have so I’m looking for help to fill in the blanks or correct any mistakes I’ve made.As far as I understand these appear to be in production or have reasonable numbers of both mechs and replacement parts in this era:Commando  Firestarter  Hermes  Javelin  Jenner  Locust  Mongoose  Stinger  In 3005 the Wolves Dragoons appeared and brought many rare Star League era mechs with them including some that had become extinct:Falcon  Flea  The ComGuards also secretly have SL era mechs, some of which* where shared with House Kurita in return for creating the Free Rasalhague Republic in 3030.Hussar*  Mercury  Thorn*  Finally I've found a few special cases:Ostscout - while many examples of the chassis seem to have survived the succession wars, the original electronics are very rare as they are nearly impossible to repair without access to lostech.Spider - 3025 TR suggests there where only single digit numbers in each of the great houses and these mechs are saved for special assignments, the Wolves Dragoons are the only ones who field them in any great number. 3039 TR suggests the FedCom where able to restart production sometime after 3025.

To prevent them from being taken elseswhere one by one I would need to clear all unoccupied cells of their room markings, keeping the prison at exact capacity. After prisoners are screened in the holding area then the right number of cells could be redesignated in the areas I want them to go.

36sy6u	-20078	1432243987	OutreachHPG	Fix the Clan collapse in CW: Open the Kerensky Cluster and start trials for right to invade.	Clan Smoke Jaguar's invaders have been pushed back to their last Inner Sphere world of Richmond, cut off from the rest of the clans. The Ghost Bears are fighting hard but by the end of the weekend they could be in the same situation. The Wolves and the Falcons are down to less then a dozen IS holdings each and are steadily losing ground. Much of this can be attributed to the unexpected disappearance of most of the invading forces' trueborn warriors. The clans are mostly left with freeborn and solahma units to hold back experienced house and mercenary companies.That is the situation in CW. The clan population is getting pug stomped by organized IS units and will soon be reduced to sitting on those 'capital' worlds with little hope of breaking out. Those who choose to play clan (for roleplay, limited mechs or contract duration) don't have much of a game left.With the shortage of warriors the only solution is to fight the Inner Sphere on a single front, lead by the strongest of the clans. This leadership must be earned through a trial of possession fought by all of the invading clans.To improve this situation I suggest opening up the Kerensky Cluster worlds (already on the map but marked as neutral) to clan vs clan warfare. If all else fails then at least clan players can fight opponents playing at the same disadvantage. If it's possible this war in the clan homeworlds doesn't need to change the planets ownership (avoiding a repeat situation where Smoke Jaguar is reduced to just Huntress). Instead each battle could be treated as a trial and each days overall winner earns the right to lead all of the clans in the following days attack on the Inner Sphere. This means instead of each clan attacking IS worlds seperately (splitting the already small number of clan players) they will be grouped and fight together under the flag of the leading clan in a manner similar to how defense works.If the issues with the clan player base/holdings improve then the situation on the clan homeworlds can 'stabilize' and the clans would resume normal fighting in the IS only.

3cgd9h	-20078	1436293437	OutreachHPG	Solo campaign (repair and rearm)	This is an idea I’ll call “solo campaign”. It’s mostly an attempt to include repair and rearm as well as an approximation of battle value that affects gameplay. It’s not really that well fleshed out so if anyone wants to take some of the core concepts and suggest something better go right ahead.        What do I want to do?    * Bring back repair and reload to players that want that immersion.* Making the cost of builds and lostech relevant.* Add new performance benchmarks beyond damage or K/D* Earn more cbills!    So how does it work?        A solo campaign starts just like a solo queue match. In fact you’ll be playing in the same solo queue matches against a mix of regular and campaign players. The difference doesn’t come until you get the end of the match and see the score screen. You’ll notice you didn’t earn as many cbills as you thought you would because your earnings have been reduced by a ‘campaign multiplier’ that starts at 50% - so you only get paid 50% of your rewards. But there is an upshot because after the payout the campaign multiplier is increased based on your match score – score higher and the multiplier goes up faster.        Exiting the match you you go to a mobile repair base screen instead of the regular mechlab. You see you’re on a campaign in enemy territory and that means you can’t switch to other mechs or get your mech repaired and rearmed for free. But all is not lost because at the beginning of a campaign you get a one time supply of spare parts (measured in cbills for convenience) to take with you.        On the mobile repair screen you have two options: Use some or all of your remaining spare parts to repair/rearm your mech and enter another match with your campaign multiplier intact or choose to retreat which returns you to the regular mechlab where you are repaired and rearmed for free but you lose your multiplier.        Unlike the beta version of R&amp;R you don’t get anything like CT or engine repaired for free, it must come out of your spare parts (no free zombie mechs). You are required to repair a certain minimum of your mech or it will not be considered valid – so you need to repair your engine, head, relevant torso sections and legs and have a certain number of weapons systems functional. If you can’t your only choice is retreat.        Once you are ready you enter your second campaign match with your fully or partially repaired mech. At the end of that match your earnings will be added up with your increased multiplier and then the multiplier will again be increased based on your performance. You can keep playing consecutive matches (earning increasing amounts of cbills) until you either run out of spare parts to meet the minimum repair requirements or you die by cockpit destruction (headshot or out of bounds).         So in nutshell campaign mode is another way of playing in solo queue, but offering higher risks and rewards by forcing you to keep your mech running on limited resources. You want to play well but also keep going for as many matches before having to retreat since this will boost your cbill earnings. A Direwolf may be powerful but the spare parts budget is probably not enough to repair it more then once – a Hunchback 4G might be average but it’s cheap to keep running. This is meant to fit in with the pug nature of the solo queue – you *will* lose some of your matches so you can’t just take the most powerful mech and expect to stay alive indefinitely while increasing your multiplier. There may need to be some control to prevent players from just hiding – maybe a minimum score that rises each match, if you don’t make it then you are recalled (forced retreat) at the end of the mission.

Having now read up on the 'disorder' (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppositional_defiant_disorder#Signs_and_symptoms) and met with the young man who has the diagnosis I am sad to say I cannot differentiate between him and most 12 year old boys in terms of how they behave! It just seems to me that unlike the other students who misbehave this young man is allowed concessions. Sometimes I think young people are too quick to be labelled with 'disorders' and medicated in an attempt to ignore the fact that they are simply kids! Of course there are disorders and I will treat this student with respect following the guidelines given but I struggle to see this as a 'disorder', I really do. Sorry for the ramblings - what do others think?

Hi Reddit,I am offered a job in Taipei with a reasonable salary (in normal circumstances).However, I have some bills to pay back home if I go there for the next two years which would leave me with 700 euros (276175 TWD) after tax, health insurance and accomodation is paid for.My question is: Is this money enough to feed me and my partner and pay for any travelling I will have to do to go to work and any other random expenses that tend to happen (and my utility bills)?Thanks in advance.
1bt15v	-20079	1365271302	shanghai	One of many panic attacks - any regrets about moving to Shanghai?	Hello everybody! My Husband and I are moving to Shanghai in August.  I already have a job (hence the move) and he has made it through to the final interview stages for a job in his field.  He is very relaxed and happy with the decision, I am very nervous about it all.  Without going into my worries (I guess I stress too much at times) I am just curious - does anybody have any regrets about moving to Shanghai?  Thanks for any reassurance/information!

I will be living in the Minhang district but willing to travel to nearby areas.  I am going to get them next month for the first time (in the Netherlands) and will be getting wefts (most likely) so the hair will be reusable.Please don't comment telling me how I will damage my hair, I lost around 80% of it due to a severe illness so trust me, anything is better than that!Thanks everybody :)

When I arrive in Shanghai I must go for the standard medical check required to gain a working visa in China.  I do not mind this at all, however, will my employer get full access to all of my medical results or will it simply state 'fit to work'?

I have received my schedule for the induction period for new employees.  The dress code for the week is the dreaded smart casual (normal dress code for the working week is blouse/skirt/trousers but we have A/C).I emailed the HR department and mentioned that in the Netherlands I would wear smart trousers, top and a blazer but I assumed that wouldn't be good in Shanghai due to heat.  Their response was 'that is perfect' D:  I fear I will melt.  I emailed a colleague who is my 'buddy' and she said she wore similar and embarrassingly sweated buckets the entire time...Any suggestions on what I could wear in the humidity (lots of outdoor activities)!?  I don't want to make a bad impression with dresses not suitable i.e. too casual (not talking revealing) or sweating profusely.Thanks everybody :)

I teach Computer Science at an international school in Shanghai and would love to expose my exam classes to "real world" programming in practice.  My students (15 total) are coding in VB/Python (exam stipulation) and I was really hoping to visit a company here that could introduce them to how it is used in a business environment/real world.I don't have a wishlist for the trip, half a day to a day is great if they can spare that time.If anybody knows of any companies who would be willing to discuss this further with me I would be eternally grateful!Thanks everybody!
10u0nq	-20087	1349207866	AskReddit	Hey reddit, any annoying cop stories you got for me?	So today my friends and I were in the handball courts after school. (NYC Middle School, we're seniors now) It's just 5 of us there getting ready to play handball. Next thing I know I see cops pull up onto the sidewalk. (normally teachers would notice, but they were all inside teaching after school programs.) They came up to us and made us get into a line. They did this with quite a protruding, not nice way. So we follow their orders. They stick their hands into my pocket and sweater's pocket. I'm not even sure about this but I'm positive this is an invasion of privacy, like really who sticks their hands down someones pants, for all I know it would've been awkward if I had a boner. Well they go through their searches in a rude way. really pissed me off. They do the same with my friends afterwards. They all ask questions about us. What really pissed me off was when they stated "oh I know you go to this school" and yet they still ask if we have IDS (unfortunately my middle school doesn't offer student IDs.) Really smart cops, really smart. Well they left afterwards, really annoying though. No warnings no nothing, just a straight forward check. Well great society nowadays. Thanks guys if you read this, just wanted to get it off my mind.

As a Brit, I was never taught about the British Empire (despite spending painfully long amount of time on other less important parts.) And my German friend was never taught about the world wars.

He was also colourblind, and regularly electrocuted himself because of that. My mother used to have to tell him what colours everything was at one point.I'd love some perspective of what others have. I am sure there's a lot of interesting variations on the spectrum.Other than laziness or addiction as they're more obvious.

We've combatted a lot of diseases and some we've managed to overcome, and some hurt us as a populous quite badly.The first part of the question is; how long has it taken us to find vaccines to some of the worse diseases we've discovered?The second is, as HIV has been known for a little over 50 years now, why does it stump us so much? I know 50 years isn't much time but it feels in my humbly layman opinion that we've overcome a lot quickly before. I presume there are some intrecies that we don't fully gripe yet?Same goes for cancer, too?Thank you, generally curious. Was discussing this earlier, but have no real knowledge to base this upon and would love to hear what the right answer is.

21nxv5	-20104	1396091473	AskReddit	Former Homeless of Reddit: What are the items you really want?	Inspired by http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/21ml9a/former_homeless_people_of_reddit_what_unwritten/This seems like an obvious question but I'm sure there are some non-obvious answers.I live in Sweden. The homeless people here fall into 3 categories generally: Pretending to be homeless (seen quite a few lose their crutches and walk into banks), agressive (people following people on the street, or just shouting at every person who walks past) or the unseen. It's become a way of life here for homeless people to say "Hej Hej" to everyone who walks pass to get attention, and I assume no malice in it. Just people trying to get heard.But because I don't know if they are pretending or are addicts, I like to buy something for them. Be it a Sandwhich, or a nice warm throw instead. My question is; What items would you be most grateful for? What would really make a difference?

23i8g3	-20104	1397996864	explainlikeimfive	ELI5: Why do Christians feel so persecuted?	Let me preface this with; keep it civil. This is not meant as a flame, but trying to understand people who are not me, better.I keep seeing Christians say they're persecuted.Christian's count for 33% of the world (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion), all(ish) American presidents claimed to be Christian, it's on America's money, in the USA, UK's courts.in your day to day life; you can bet that if you live in the UK or the States, what you can and cannot do has been strongly affected by someone religious.And as far as I can remember, but my history isn't great - nothing like the Holocaust has happened to Christians.I also don't see any reportings of the Atheist equivalent of Westboro Baptist Church. However, that doesn't mean it doesn't exist or isn't prevalent in some places.I know people are sensitive about their beliefs, whatever they may be. But why do why do so many Christians feel persecuted? As an outsider it seems quite a pro-Christian western world.

I have a debit card and they don't charge any bank fees for any transaction I make. I can't use this card online though, so I started looking into PayPal and saw that I can do an EFT to put funds in my PayPal account. Can someone advise me a bit on this? Will PayPal charge a lot for transactions, also do they have some monthly fee for me having X amount of money on that account?Can I go into credit with PayPal? I really do not want that.Kind Regards

1iokhl	-20137	1374300103	nosleep	The voice's in my head, will they ever stop?	As I sit here laying in bed typing this, the voice's in my head do not stop. They carry into my dreams and remind me that I am forever not alone. The voice's creep in one ear and out the other. They tell me to do things, such horrible things that I should not speak of. I should probably give you some background information. As I am part Native American. Every year on Memorial day my family an I go to a camp ground for a gather, known as a PowWow. Ever since I was little we would drive the few hours to get there and go to our normal spot to set up our tents and take in the nature. When I was about Seven or Eight it was different though. Upon entering the camp ground with my mother and sister I heard a whisper, turning to my mother asking if she had said anything and she replied with a soft, "nope." I shook it off as to believing I had just imagined it or it was just something that was said on the radio, misheard. As a little kid of that age I obviously sprinted out of the car and straight for the playground stopping to grab something to eat before sitting down in the sand, smiling as I gleefully took in the nature and the quietness that I had missed for over a year. As I sitting in the newly made tree house I heard a whisper. It sounded like the muffled voice of a little girl. I once again blew it off as maybe one of the other children on the play ground. Once night fall had set I walked to the camp site as requested by my mother. Upon my return I was amazed to see the campfire going and everyone sitting around making smores. I pulled up a chair and grabbed a stick, pushing the white fluffy goodness onto the end and hovering it over the campfire. In that moment another whisper went through my head but this time it was louder. At this point I was really starting to get freaked out so I told my mother and she played it off as if I was making up and told me once I was done eating to go to bed. I did as requested, and Laying in my tent bundled up in my mountain of blankets I heard the sane whisper of a little girl, and with every whisper it kept getting louder and louder. I couldn't help but let out a loud cry and frantically grab my things and move from my sisters and I's tent to my mothers to sleep with her. I fell asleep feeling safe in her arms. The night was normal after that.At sunrise the next morning I awoke to a loud scream. It was the campers next to us. I unzipped the tent to my horror that there in front of the next tent over from mine was their little girl in a pool or her own blood. As the police arrived my mother, my sister and I had frantically finished packing our things up and started to leave. I once again hear the whisper of a young girl. I could finally make out exactly what she was saying, but at this point she did not sound innocent like a child. She sounded enraged, and with every breath I took I kept hearing over and over, "look at what you made me do, LOOK AT WHAT YOU MADE ME DO!" I crouched down, holding my head in my hands choking back tears in the backseat. I to this day have not set foot on that camp ground in fear that I too shall become victim such as the little girl who was camping next to us. I hear the whispers, telling me to do such things, as to harm people, and myself. When I sleep, the little girl visits me, dressed in animal fur, covered in blood with eyes as black as night. She creeps into my dreams and just whispers to me, telling me things I should do. I have not spoken of what happened that day on the camp ground to anyone other than my mother and sister. I don't speak of the little girl who whispers in my head louder in the odd hours of the night. I have not even thought about telling my husband about such things. Nor does he know that I am part Native American and neither shall my unborn child. I hope for my and my family's sake that I do not birth a girl, for I am scared of what might happen in the odd hours of the night.

1iqwzy	-20137	1374409543	Anxiety	How can i deal with anxiety while in a car? [Help]	I have been diagnosed with Anxiety for over a year now and about two months ago I was diagnosed with 3 forms of ADHD. Last December I was in the car with a friend and it was a bad snow storm and he was trying me home. Well, he was going a little too fast around a corner and we slid into a snow bank, just short of a telephone pole and were stick for about half an hour. I as well took drivers ed last summer, and was fine driving with the instructor. But my mom has Anxiety as well and when she takes me out driving its a mess. So to the fact that I got into a car accident and my mother can't help me get my driving hours, I refuse to go driving because of my anxiety. In result, i just turned 17 and half a car, yet have my licence. My boyfriend also loves to speed on the highway while driving, he is so used to it he cant help it. He knows my anxiety about cars and being in cars and he's trying but sometimes he forgets. I also hate being in the car when its someone other than my Mother or one of my two sisters. And rain seriously freaks me out while in a car unless i'm in the car with my mother. Does anyone, anyone at all know how to help me get over my fears of driving or anything else?

(http://i.imgur.com/laWIvZz.jpg)  I am so excited and cannot wait to be able to read them all. They are all either old and starting to yellow or are in good condition and I know I will take care of them whether or not they are worn out.

However, I think it's for the best, but needs a bit of numerical tweaking to be effective, especially on his ult. That's not what we're here to talk about though. I'm here to talk about the numbers behind old Parrrley and new Parrrley. Ok, put on your math hat, because it's numbers time.First thing! The balance between cooldown and damage. The damage nerf: say you've got it at max level. 120 + your AD, which at level nine should be... 54 + (8 x 3) = 78. 198 damage, unreduced. Before the change, his damage was 150 + your AD which would equal 228 damage, unreduced. 30 damage down.Base damage down: 30Crit damage down: 60IE crit damage down: 75So there's the numbers, again, without taking into reduction from armor or whatever. So you've got a 12% damage reduction. However, you've also got more shots. How many more, though?	16.66667% more shots, provided you hit them right as cooldown hits. Now, this might sound a bit excessive, but really, positioning oneself so that you can instantly cast the ability again is not as hard as it sounds. Still, it can be difficult at times.So, mathematically, his potential damage has gone up to 102.06% of what it was before.Now, taking into account the practical measures of the math, this means that overall, Gangplank will probably end up doing less damage with normal crit builds. However, I propose an alternate solution that I have not tested thoroughly, and would like some feedback on from other people: Sheenplank. Lets calculate the damage done over 100 shots, because normalization is bitchin'. Also, for the sake of argument, let's say you've been maxing your Parrrley at every possible level.1250 gold will get you a Sheen. For 1280 gold you can get 26% crit chance, from gloves and cloak. You could save up a bit more - 1550 - to get another 4% from Avarice Blade, giving you 30% crit from items. R/M here could give you another few percent, but most people don't run crit runes on him. For about the same amount of money, you could get a Sheen, or 26% crit chance. Let's look at some data next.Gangplank's base AD at following levels, or when you would level Parrrley:- Level 1: 54- Level 3: 60- Level 5: 66- Level 7: 72- Level 9: 78Gangplank's base Parrrley damage at each rank:- Rank 1: 20- Rank 2: 45- Rank 3: 70- Rank 4: 95- Rank 5: 120This is all obvious stuff. Together it gives us the following numbers:Base damage for Parrrley, no sheen or crit:- Rank 1: 74- Rank 2: 105- Rank 3: 136- Rank 4: 167- Rank 5: 198100 shots with 26% crit chance:74 shots normal26 shots critFormula: (Parrrley total damage x number of non crits) + ((Parrrley total damage x 2) x number of crits)Effective damage for Parrrley, crit:- Rank 1: 74 - 9324- Rank 2: 105 - 13230- Rank 3: 136 - 17136- Rank 4: 167 - 21042- Rank 5: 198 - 24948100 shots with sheenAll 100 shots proc sheen :PFormula: (Parrrley + base AD) x 100Effective damage for Parrrley, sheen:- Rank 1: 74 - 12800- Rank 2: 105 - 16500- Rank 3: 136 - 20200- Rank 4: 167 - 23900- Rank 5: 198 - 27600So, due in part to the reduced base damage of Parrrley, but the unchanged base AD of Gangplank means that the value of sheen has gone up significantly. Don't get me wrong, I'm not arguing that Sheen trumps crits every time. Once you break about 35 % crit chance, sheen's effective damage is inferior. However, what about Trinity Force and Infinity Edge. here's some more data, in graph form.[Graph that shows the data for Infinity Edge vs Trinity Force damage based on level and rank of Parrrley](http://i.imgur.com/lEG38.png)[Graph that shows the data for Infinity Edge vs Trinity Force damage based on Crit Chance](http://i.imgur.com/lyPYJ.png)GRAPHS!Sheen/Triforce have become even more viable on GP. Not that they weren't before, but they did have trouble competing at times. Now, with the Parrrley base damage nerf, they outclass crit pound-for-pound early on, but when you get enough crit chance, you end up doing more damage with Infinity Edge. This means that either build is equally viable, and it's up to the player to decide what they enjoy. However, given how good GP is at farming, there's no reason to not get them both. Hooray!Am I happy with the changes? I'm kinda neutral, and while I appreciate his damage being more consistent, his early game has certainly taken a hit here. With the damage on his ult being so low early on, it's a negligible threat until 11 at least. Technically, his Parrrley did get buffed from a completely numerical perspective.I do like the use-it-anywhere part of the new Raise Morale, and it's a pretty big buff, but the denying being gone makes me a bit sad. However, I can understand why they did it. The other player couldn't do anything about it, and had no way to stop you from just killing your own cannon minions every time they arrived. It was a bit unbalanced, and Riot doesn't like the idea of denying. Remove Scurvy... is not really changed. Helpful tiny buff at early levels, less later on when it matters less. Wooooooo...The changes are not all that massive, and due to the fact that almost everyone doesn't like it, he'll probably be tweaked a bit in the coming patches.**tl;dr: Sheen/TriForce on him is just as effective as Crit. There's some graphs. He needs some numerical tweaks, especially for his ult.**Edit: tbydal has done some math down the thread about AD to Crit scaling on the two items. Go take a look. We're pretty sure he did it right.

j6z98	-20157	1312313359	gardening	Need some advice on hardy flowers	Hey /r/gardening, I could use some help. I need to figure out what sort of flowers I should plant in a public place that aren't going to just die off when the going gets tough, as it were. Something that doesn't need too much water beyond rainfall and can take a whole lot of sun. Full sun. Almost the whole day. Basically something that can survive almost anything. Any ideas? I know not the first thing about what sorts of flowers are better at not dying if you leave them be.
j737y	-20157	1312320818	twincitiessocial	Planting flowers in the city	Basically the idea here is that I'm planning to do a bit of gardening in south Minneapolis. Primarily, I'm planning on fixing up [this garden-box tub](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38th+and+4th+Street,+Minneapolis,+Minnesota.&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=44.933977,-93.270128&amp;spn=0,0.016512&amp;sll=44.934130,-93.270124&amp;sspn=0.006295,0.006295&amp;layer=c&amp;cbp=13,176.82,,0,21.1&amp;cbll=44.93413,-93.270355&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;panoid=6gvAoAoelMGh3BK9ju5j7w) at the bus stop at E 38th St &amp; 4th Ave S.  I don't know whether it qualifies as "guerrilla" gardening or whatever, but I'll be damned if there aren't some marigolds or something in that box by next Monday.  The basic story goes as follows: I was at the bus stop, saw a man clearing weeds, tilling soil, etc. in that tub, asked him what he was doing. He didn't speak English terribly well, but he told me "Maybe, if I do this, someone will plant flowers here."So I am going to plant flowers there. I'm going to be in town this weekend until the 8th. I don't know exactly when I'll be going out there, probably Sunday the 7th. Not sure. Anyone who knows anything about gardening - guerrilla or otherwise - is welcome to come and make this corner a little less desolate. I was informed that this subreddit might want to know about it, so... yep.Update 1: Looks like things have taken a turn for the worse, folks. [The planter is gone.](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/j7b8s/challenge_completerrorre_kickass_flowerbed_guy/) I don't really know what to say besides [I'm sorry](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/j6rth/kickass_flowerbed_guy/c29mdv4). The planter isn't there any more, but that doesn't mean we can't go planting things in some place that needs it. I just let that guy down, and it feels pretty awful. But nonetheless. We can plant the *hell* out of some flowers. We just need to figure out where and when now.Update 2: I'm going to be moving about and trying to find somewhere to plant something on Sunday the 7th. I'll be around the neighborhood of 38th and Cedar, scouting things out, and then planting stuff that evening.

D&amp;D 3.5, vanilla ruleset, party level ~5.My players had an encounter with a [Rast](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/rast.htm#) last night during a storm. It ended up, as Rasts do, flying out of reach of the melee fighters and paralyzed the caster. Because of the rain, ranged attacks were less reliable than usual so the Ranger and the Fighter were having a bit of trouble just shooting at it. After the Ranger summoned an eagle to go harass this Rast, which immediately resulted in a dead eagle, the Barbarian started looking around for things to throw at this horrible dozen-armed thing that kept paralyzing the Sorcerer. He decided that the Sorcerer's riding dog was the best option. Now, I really had no idea how to call that. It might just be a normal thrown improvised weapon ranged attack, with an appropriate weight for damage, but throwing a dog can't be easy. Should there be a Handle Animal check of some kind? He was trying to throw it 20 feet into the air at this Rast, so would that be a Strength check to even make it that far? Mind you, this was a raging Orc barbarian, so he might've actually been able to make the throw. **tl;dr: Orc barbarian tried to throw a riding dog at a flying creature. What kind of checks would that require?**I really don't know the technical way to handle tossing a 90-lb dog as a weapon. Has anyone else ever run into this sort of problem, or have any proposed solutions to the dog-weapon problem? Any obscure rulebooks have any insight as to using other creatures as improvised weapons that I don't know about?

1qynf2	-20175	1384844766	tifu	TIFU by telling my co-worker she would make a good stripper.	I work at a local Italian place washing dishes and cooking. You know, the family run place that mostly hires younger kids looking for a first job. We had just finished one of 2 total morning shifts each week where we have a buffet. During these shifts, once the last customer leaves, we get to lock the doors and take a roughly 20 minute break and eat what's left of the buffet. There are only 5 of us working these shifts because they are slow; 2 in back(usually guys) and 2 servers ad a host(or hostess) up front. Because there are so few of us we all go on break together and hang out while we eat; so we are all pretty good friends. Anyway, the front workers are done preparing the restaurant for the night shift, and the two of us are finishing up the dishes. As the last server leaves out the back door, the 3 of us talk a little and someone brings up how the way the boss asked if she could pick up an extra shift next week could be misinterpreted to ask if she was a stripper. Now we all have a chuckle at this, and being the type of person to always try to make people laugh, I thought I would follow up with a joke.              I shouldn't have.What was meant to be a funny remark about giving up this job to become a stripper turned out to be "even though I've never pictured it (awkward chuckle here) I bet you would make an amazing stripper." After making this remark and immediately regretting it, she gives me the most "you are weird as fuck' look, I awkwardly fast walk around the corner, she leaves, and the other guy proceeds to give me crap for it the rest of the day. Not exactly sure how I'm going to be able to talk to her now. It might help after I turn 21 in 2 weeks and can get drunk first. Maybe.TL;DR: tried to make my friend laugh, ended up essentially saying I picture her being a stripper.

3c9qdz	-20175	1436159088	tifu	TIFU by making a joke about my boss's dead father without thinking	I work at a local, family-owned Italian restaurant. A small place where I work with the owner (I'll call the owner) and his wife (who I'll call the boss). Around 2 weeks ago, the boss's father passed away and they have had issues with the estate ever since. They left again today for the father's house to try to sort things out(it is about a 3-4 hour drive depending on who's driving), and the owner managed to forget his phone at the restaurant.His phone is the number they gave to the estate attorney when they need to be contacted, as well as the one they use for things like catering, reservations, and private business. Being the most trusted employee, I was placed in charge of watching the phone and updating them on any messages.A few hours ago, the owner's phone received a call. I forgot to turn the phone volume up as I'm used to androids which don't have a specific button to set it to silent, so it didn't ring and I missed the call. The name on the call was "Father", so I thought it would be someone the owner would want to call back; I pulled out my phone and dialed the boss' s number.The boss picks up, and I say "hey boss, I just missed a call from the owner's phone, it was labeled "Father" so I assumed it was the owner's dad and he would want to call him back."She says thanks, asks if everything was going ok with the restaurant, and just as she hangs up I realize what I just said: I joked that she will never get a call from her father again.TL;DR: accidentally told my boss she wasn't going to get any calls from her Father ever again, just a couple weeks after her Father's death and in the middle of dealing with his estate.

[TED Talk: Jane McGonigal, The game that can give you 10 extra years of life](http://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_the_game_that_can_give_you_10_extra_years_of_life.html)I watched a TED talk today (see the above link) about this person who suffered a traumatic brain injury and then created a game to get herself through the aftermath. She talked about [*posttraumatic growth*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_growth); to quote: "It seems that somehow a traumatic event can unlock our ability to lead a life with fewer regrets."So here's my question: *To what extent can bad trips be considered positive experiences?* Has anyone here experienced personal growth in the aftermath of a bad trip? Alternatively, has anyone experienced persistent, posttraumatic stress following a bad trip?

I got the tank when it was about 1/2" - 3/4" and it is now 3" roughly and healthy! Fed seaweed every few days and a good bit of mysis shrimp every day and a serving of pellets. Nice and fat and very happy. I am looking to get $70. Please contact me here and anyone is free to come see the fish. I am moving the tank in about 2 weeks so I hope there is someone in knoxville or in Tennessee that wants her!I will post pictures when I return from Oregon on Monday.

1k3o1b	-20184	1376160676	cancer	I'm so tired.	I punched cancer in the face. Last april I was diagnosed with hodgkin's disease, on my birthday and after some biopsys and what not I started treatment in early may. 4 months of ABVD, followed by 30Gy of irradiation. Best birthdaygift ever.After being too high on life I started way to early with doing stuff again. In Januari ( 3 months after finishing all the physical therapies ) I started working 40 hr/week again and in 4 weeks I burnt out. I went to bed. For four months. In may I started doing physiotherapy and started working out again, four weeks ago I ran 5km in 23 minutes. Quite a milestone. I go to the gym 2/3 times a week now and I'm starting to lose a bit of the fat I munched in the last 6 months. But next to all of this i'm still structurally tired. I can keep up with my friends for 2 - 4 days, and then I need to go to bed for like nearly a week.For people who also had chemo/irradiation: did this tiredess go away? I'm really scared to get stuck with it for the rest of my life. I'm gonna try to start to go back to uni in september so I'm hoping having a bit more rhytm and something to do will help.And more tips/hints? I know, hospital gives me answers to these questions aswell but it's better to hear it from someone who had cancer aswell.

1n90tq	-20184	1380292996	Guitar	I'm lost in amps	Hello,So recently, after finally having 2 guitar I will definitly keep, which are both pretty versatile I started my quest for a new amp. I currently in my bedroom have a Marshall g10cd which has been there for like.. 10 years. I own a Jackson DKMG, a Fender MIM strat, a ibanez electro acoustic and 3 other acoustic guitars.So I thought lets do crazy and buy a vox. Bought a VOX AC15VR. This is one of the hybrid ones. I owned it for two weeks and thank god was able to sell it. It was very harsh, had a lot of high and I really need my mid eq. So I thought lets do crazy again. My buddy is selling his Marshall JCM900 50 watt dual reverb 4500. I currently have it here with a 1960a cab. I thought, man this relatively expensive valve amp.. I must definitly fall in love and buy it!Guess what..I didn't.I mean dont get me wrong. I'm a bit of a princess right now. This amp is pretty damn good. It produces solid loud audio, maybe the mids are a bit weird thats all. But I miss warmth.Then I tried someones Peavey Triple x over the same cab. It's just like the jcm a damn good amp, but also I'm missing warmth in the cleans. The distortion is crazy-good, but again the mids are not well defined enough for my taste.What would be good amps to look for? Maybe a REAL vox? Like a AV15 C1 or something like that? I want it to like some pedal, have good define mids and sound warm. I'm really lost.[edit]Everybody thanks for the ideas and help. I've got some stuff to check out the next few weeks before buying anything :). Gonna try a bunch of amps.
1nebx1	-20184	1380489864	ShittyLifeProTips	When your car starts the engine is cold, rev it up into the red constantly to quickly warm it!	Your car will run more efficient and better when its warm. When you start just keep revving high until its warm!

1vaw74	-20184	1389818569	Terraria	Where to continue?	So I've managed to get 4 NPC's now, tried the skeletron but he totally whooped my ass. I'm currently in a full suit of tungsten, with a nice wizard hat and a pretty baller staff.I dug all the way to the part where its all lava and black and cavey. Should I stay above this layer and find more gold chests and stuff? I also have enough crimtane to make a better axe then the one im using now - the gold axe - but I need the flesh stuff.What should I do to progress? Needing that flesh stuff makes me feel I'm not progressing atm.
1vd0qf	-20184	1389881159	Guitar	What was your favorite bargain?	I think we all have them.. you see something secondhand in a store.. or ebay or what not and you just buy it because it's cheap. And after a few months or years.. you just tend to stick with it. Sort of by accident.My dirty little secret is that I bought a Marshall G15RCD for $40.. like 10 years ago. Production date is 2001, hehe. And I like it, a lot actually. I've been playing it for allmost 10 years. I don't know, theres just something about it.So, confess up my dear gearheads. Whats a piece of gear that you shouldnt have because you know it's kinda bad but you still use it?

Since we live in a at 0 amsl you could potentially get good results. But, what will happen with the gas mileage? They say it will improve, but I can't find any evidence for it. Only chiptuners say it improves, but thats weird to say about your own business.

I still have some graphic artefact issues. Would it still be worth upgrading the ram and putting in a new battery?

1aeijd	-20188	1363426182	trees	I love bonding experiences with my girlfrient!	Tonight me and my girlfrient decided we wanted to go see the new Oz movie after my lacrosse game today. I decided we should vape a big trench before the movie to have extra fun, we were running late so i decided to bring my launch box into the movie with us so we could vape in the theatre. We got popcorn and a soda and it was an amazing experience! The new Oz movie was so good high, i spent the whole time tripping out at the effects, which were amazing, and making connections between the movie and the great gatsby. Not sure why but hey i was high! I highly recommend all of you ents go grab your girlfrients/ boyfrients or just a group of frients and get stoned and watch this movie. Thanks for listening just felt like sharing [7] TL/DR: Brought my vape into the movies with my girlfrient and had an awesome bonding time watching Oz

The camera arrived four days ago, and I've since used it to shoot a two day event (photos) and a band (video w/ shoulder rig and external mic).  I've picked up on most things really quickly.  One small issue I'm having is that the screen doesn't light up unless I press a button or do some function.  With Nikon, my screen would darken when I put my eye to the viewfinder, and light up when I took it away.  I'm assuming this is due to a proximity sensor.  Does my 5D not have this feature?

Norman wanted a second sample of the chocolate cake they were handing out, but he was embarrassed about getting two. Norman decided to walk around the store once more, then surreptitiously pick up a second chocolate cake sample, hoping the sales associate handing out the samples would not notice.Norman picked up cat food for his cat, Norman. Frozen breakfast sandwiches were on sale at a good price as well as sliced turkey. There were also 2015 calendars for the new year. "I can't believe it's almost 2015!" Norman said to himself as he put a calendar into his cart.Norman noticed that the sales associate handing out chocolate cake samples had changed. He surreptitiously picked up a third sample of chocolate cake. Feeling guilty, he noticed that the cake was only $8.99. Norman felt obligated to pick up the cake after getting three samples instead of just one. Norman then went to the checkout, and was slightly irritated by the long line of people. His  bill was $83.25. "I always get too much at Costco!" he exclaimed, and promised himself that next time, he would only buy what he needed.

I think the class should involve learning about what careers are out there, offer opportunities to job shadow people whose jobs you're interested in, and have guest speakers come and talk about what they do. At the end of the semester kids should do short presentations on 2-3 careers that appeal to them with information on the nature of the job, salary, education, etc. Financially and technically there are many things that would need to be worked out, but I think it would be awesome to have had that available in high school.

I have about 4 years of experience volunteering and acting as a leader with underserved communities at a clinic and and some shaky work experience at a nursing home type settings which I left relatively quickly due to abusive work conditions. The nursing job market in my state is competitive and I realize that, and that "bedside" nursing work is not where my heart is; I want to do research and I want to teach. My GPA is 3.6 and I have good references.This fall I am applying to several MPH and PhD programs. I want to know how competitive it is to be admitted into such programs. Thank you! And I apologize if this is not appropriate to this forum. Edit: right now I am getting volunteer teaching experience with kids and at various community outreach healthcare classes I am hoping to get involved with research over the summer and am in communication with a small rural clinic and school which may be open to me working there in the fall once I send out applicationsEdit: I am planning to apply to several UC's and Cal States as well as a few local private schools and a few local faith based schools (keeping things vague to be relatively anonymous)

Hello everyone, [my channel is called ARTexplains](www.youtube.com/ARTexplains). It's a not-so-serious educational show where I use jump cuts, silly illustrations, and whatever else comes to mind to explain something.I am working on improving my audio and video quality and have a new camera for the next episode. What I am concerned with most now, however, is improving the entertainment quality of my show. Are there any laugh out loud moments? Am I a presenting well?Any suggestions at all are appreciated.If you only have time to watch one video, I recommend [The Cheerleader Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULcEx2Yyu0M), [Blowholes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zre_FdcrFUU) or [Body Odor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frXgHSqsVHU) which I believe are my best ones.Thank you for your time!

Hell, we're born not even knowing how to walk, let alone sing or draw.You have to accept that when you start out, the stuff you make won't be very good. Regardless of if you have 'natural talent' or not (we can debate if that's even a significant thing!), the hours that you put in matter far more.Still not sure?

Just look at the difference between [my first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvVObo9yhX0):And [my latest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05C8Qcyshmo):Let's be honest, that first video is not something I'd be eager to display professionally. But it is something I'm proud of! Because I STARTED.I thought about doing it for years. I actually drew those bee sketches and recorded their buzzes (from the first video) an entire YEAR before I filmed the video. They sat in my Settlers of Catan box the whole time, waiting to be used.So finally, I set myself a firm deadline to put up something, anything. And you know what? It was kind of a failure. But it was kind of a success too.All I know is, the step I'm on wouldn't be possible without those shaky first steps.Here it is in the words of a successful internet entrepreneur, Craig Benzine: [START](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PvXmPaD0TQ&amp;index=2&amp;list=FL_WDMGkurmtCRBJkz6WCOyg)And here it is [in the words of a cartoon dog]( http://i.imgur.com/lD0pnu6.png):Don't worry about tripping over your own feet.

3bcalm	-20226	1435440190	makemychoice	Do I continue in the creative direction that I am going in or do I need to compromise?	Hey, thanks for reading.I run a small educational Youtube channel, and there are very few like it. Mine are general 'intrigue' videos with trivia and puns and sources and drawings. I have been making an honest effort for over a year now.It's killing me how I can't find other people who make similar content to mine. There are no good resources for the type of content I make. Either you're a big educational channel or your channel dies quickly, it feels like.In contrast, Youtube is saturated with certain types of videos. Minecraft "Let's Plays", for example. But also "Top Ten" videos, or "Reaction" videos, or "Product Reviews".And it makes me, well, bitter, to see a top ten video thrown together by a youtuber in what seems like thirty minutes getting thousands of views, and my episodes, which I painstakingly research and assemble, are rotting fruit on the ground with barely a yak gnawing at them. (I am, of course biased, you make your own call)I *could* do a lot of those things. Make clickbait videos. Make popular content. But what if I lose my passion and fire as a result? It feels like selling out because it wasn't what I set out to do.Maybe this is just jealousy, I don't know. But maybe I should stop listening to my heart and start listening to the advertising revenue. Because I want to make videos for a living someday, it's what I'm passionate about.Should I make the videos I want, my way, with love, but few viewers?Or should I bite the clickbait bullet and try to be hip with the cool kids so that I can be popular too?The channel is called [ARTexplains](https://www.youtube.com/user/ARTexplains) if you think looking at it will help with decision making.

1mk5r3	-20249	1379403153	Anxiety	[Rant] I feel guilty because my Mum's trying to help	Today I've been having an episode. I usually live in the city for school but I've been down at Mum's for a couple of days. I couldn't get out of bed til 2pm, which was about when Mum woke up since she was on nightshift. She immediately noticed something was up. My anxiety and depression today has no cause, as far as I can tell. Mum also suffers from depression so she knows how it is. Yay, genetic predisposure!She suggested I take the puppy for a walk so I did, we just walked around aimlessly for an hour and a half and exercise is supposed to help but I felt the exact same when I came back. Mum got out a catalogue for a store that's having a sale and offered to take me to go have a look, so I went with her because that's what she wanted. She ended up picking out 10 dresses for me to try on.. I ended up with three dresses, two pairs of jeans, a new jumper. She spent $250 on me and I know it was to help me out of my funk because when we left the store with me smiling and putting on emotions despite inside feeling completely apathetic and otherwise upset she said "Sometimes a change is as good as a holiday". She's trying to help me but it's not working, and now I have three gorgeous dresses that fit me really well and Mum is a couple of hundred dollars poorer and it hasn't helped.I'm sitting here with tears running down my face and I feel so fucking guilty because she normally doesn't notice when my depression is playing up and when she does she tries so hard to help but it's not workiiiiiing :(

1t4wqz	-20257	1387331396	James100DayChallenge	Day 0: The Outline	I have decided I am unhappy with my life.  I am going to spend 100 days and attempt to live the "perfect" life.  The goal is that by the end of the 100 days (which will be a day before my 29th birthday), I will be much closer to the person I want to be then the one I currently am.  I am overweight, lazy, and not headed on the path I expected to be nor want to be.  I can fix this.**The 5 Rules**1.  Lose weight.  My biggest vice is overeating, mainly pizza and fast food washed down with soda.  I will abstain from all of these (pizza, fast-food, soda) for a full 100 days.  There is no reason to eat them, nothing to be gained, so they will be cut completely.  Booze should be cut, but I think it serves an important social function so will limit myself to no more then 3 drinks per 24 hour period. 2. Utilize my time.  I waste *way* too much time online and on TV, often both at the same time.  I will spend less then 60 minutes per day wasted; this includes browsing on-line, games (mainly Civ5 and flash sites), and all TV.  The only exception will be football and baseball games, but I will limit the day before to 30 minutes to compensate.  If I go over 30 minutes, no sports games.3.  Learn.  My brain is atrophying and needs to be kick-started.  I will spend 1-hour per day learning a skill that I would like to have (programming, Spanish, advanced math, etc.).  4. Exercise.  I miss my days of being in ridiculously good shape.  While I never had the ripped abs, or giant arms, I could bench 300lbs and then run 10 miles.  My goal is too spend 1 hour each day on exercise.  this can be running, biking, lifting, stretching, yoga, etc.  5. Reflection.  I will start and end each day with 15-minutes of my own yoga/meditation/stretching hybrid to calm the mind and focus myself.  I will also write an entry here for every single day, no matter how deep and long or short and shallow.  Bring on Day 1!
1t85bs	-20257	1387428874	James100DayChallenge	Day0.1:	Today was terrible from the start.  I missed my alarm, something I have not done in over a year.  The rest of the day only got worse.  I will start with day 1 tomorrow.  No a great sign....
1taenr	-20257	1387499832	James100DayChallenge	Day 1:Wasted Opportunity	**Weight:**270.6**Calories:**4145**Meditation:**Yes**Notes:**Today was an opportunity, as I did not have to work for the first time since early November.  I spent a good deal of the time relaxing, napping, and watching TV.  I ate well all day, but then ruined it by ordering pizza and soda.  Terrible idea.  I was not really hungry, now I am stuffed.  I wasted money I don't have.  I broke rules that I did not really have to.Positives though include not using snooze at all, doing 15-minutes of meditation in the AM, eating well most of the day, and keeping up with emails and calls.  Also, as long as I go to bed soon (before 9:30) I will be primed to do very well tomorrow.  Day 2, here I come!
1tdklh	-20257	1387600492	James100DayChallenge	Day 2: When will I really start?	**Weight:**269.2**Calories:**5769**Meditation:**Yes**Notes:**The mall is killing me.  15 hour days, standing there.  Terrible food, boredom, and inactivity are really going to be the death of me (literally).  Less then a week, but I really do need to sack up and just stop eating bad.  I will not regret it.  Tomorrow will be tough, as I will be even more tired and less prepared to bring my own food, but I CAN DO IT.  No excuses tomorrow.  No soda, no food court food.  That is what makes tomorrow a success.  Just do that.On a positive note, I tackled 3 items that have been on my to-do list for weeks.  None of them were that hard.  Why can I not just act like this normally?  Just do it really is a genius motto.  I know intellectually that I will never say 'I wish I had procrastinated' or 'I wish I had just taken one more day to be a lazy, gluttonous piece of shit'.  So why is it so hard to 'just do it'?
1tggkt	-20257	1387714476	James100DayChallenge	Day 3: Nothing is as hard as it seems	**Weight:**269.0**Calories:**3380**Meditation:**No**Notes:**Almost done with the mall.  I cannot seem to get my shit together at the mall, working ridiculous hours.  However that is no excuse for  eating like shit today when I really did not have to.  Tomorrow will have the exact same goal, but WILL have a different outcome. No soda, no fast food.  Period.  No excuses, no justifications.
1tibvz	-20257	1387774017	James100DayChallenge	Day 4: Stuck in a Twilight Zone episode	**Weight:**268.6**Calories:**5220**Meditation:**NO**Notes:**Same thing day after day.  No change.  I tell myself *'Today will be different, today I will turn it around.  I **know** what it is I need to do to be successful and happier, I just have to execute'*  And then I eat like shit, be extremely lazy and feel awful for the day.  As soon as a tiny glitch occurs in my day *'Well might as well keep on this self-destructive path today and tomorrow will be the real start day'*.  the whole idea of a 100-day challenge was the idea of a definitive start date.The worst part is that I am scared.  These are changes that I have wanted to implement for years now (literally).  How do I break the cycle?  What do I need to do?  I will try again to tomorrow, and I would like to report a successful day.  God help me...
1tkpud	-20257	1387850138	James100DayChallenge	Day 5: Eh...	**Weight:**???**Calories:**????(4000+)**Meditation:**NO**Notes:**So just decided not to go to work until later.  Made up excuses, lied...par for the course really.  Got there, actually did some work, although not really. Cannot wait for this to be over tomorrow.  The mall is absolutely killing me, no question.  Remember this when finding a job, the environment and people and other major components can either help you or slowly kill you.  Find a place that is energetic, risk taking, "embetterment" focused, and you will improve your life while collecting a pay check.  Our you can take anything and die a little each day.  Your choice.
1tn2a7	-20257	1387929479	James100DayChallenge	Day 6: The end of the mall!!!	**Weight:**???**Calories:**????(4000+)**Meditation:**NO**Notes:**Finally left the mall.  No more excuses for anything.  Diet needs to improve ASAP, exercise plan should begin Thursday, productivity should be maximized.  Time to start waking up at 5am and getting a work out in, and then crushing the day.  I cannot wait, I am so excited.  Maybe the mall era was a way to show me how bad and lazy and shitty I could be.

No fancy tricks, just be a man and do it.  I wrote my "Mission Statement" today and I really need to abide by it ASAP.&gt;No excuses.  You know EXACTLY what you need to be doing to be successful, wealthy, happy, sit, and envied.  You know what you should not do and what you should do.    You do the “bad” things because it is easy.  It is easy not to exercise.  It is easy to order pizza.  It is easy to not put yourself out there.  It is easy to be quite and blend in.  It is easy to drift along, not failing but not succeeding either.  It is easy to create lists and diatribes of what you should be doing.  It is harder to commit to getting a workout every day.  It is hard to plan and prepare your own food.  It is hard to ask out the girl, demand a raise, cold call.  It is hard to expect failure and do it.&gt;&gt;You are currently at the comfortable position of not failing.  You are not succeeding, but you are not failing.  You can turn on the TV or open a magazine and see a plethora of stories of people actually failing and you can feel better about yourself, because at least you are not as bad as them.  But guess what?  Once they fail, they realize that they are still alive the next day.  Fear of failure is much worse than the fear of death, because while you cannot escape death, you can lead a boring life and escape any real failure.  &gt;&gt;The reason that you are in this state of limbo, while knowing what it takes to escape it and succeed, is that you want to dip the toe in, so to speak.  One of the defining moments in my life was quarry jumping with Curtis.  I had jumped form the quarry a number of times before, but on one approach I just felt off.  Maybe a missed step or anticipation that I would get to the cliff in an odd mid-stride and be forced to take off early or run right off.  I tried to stop myself in order to do the approach again, but as I was in full stride I wasn’t able to stop until I got right to the edge of the cliff.  Waving my arms and trying to back away, I was staring over the edge to an extremely and potential fatal fall.  Curtis actually got up, not to pull me in, but to shove me over the edge, as that was the only option.  Before he got to me, I realized what was happening, and more importantly what would happen, and launched myself off in the ugliest jump ever.  I landed a literally awkwardly and I think I got a bruise, but nothing serious happened.&gt;&gt;I did not commit 100%.  I was holding back, playing it safe.  If I had just jumped originally, I would have been fine and not have scared everybody near to death.  But that is how you live your life, reserved, with an escape plan so that if things get a little difficult or uncertain, you can bail and go back to safety.  That is how faceless herd animals live.  They do live, but almost at the discretion of the apex predators.  You want to be an apex predator, not a faceless, meaningless, worthless herd animal who’s only achievement in life is raising another herd animal that can be food for the apex carnivores.&gt;&gt;So you know what you have to do.  Do it.  Not “I will try”, or “Tomorrow”, or “One more cheat day”, or “I am too busy”, or “That is too hard, I will wean myself in”.  Do it, 100%, from day 1.  You will be sore, you will be tired, you will feel frazzled at times.  That will pass.  You will build it into a routine that will become a habit that will become a part of your DNA.  You will have no choice but to succeed.  People will view you as lucky, or gifted, or as handed everything, but they will know, deep down where they don’t want to admit to, that they too could have what you have, that they are just too scared to reach for that brass ring.  They will try and chop you down, discredit you, use deceit and lies to hamper you because they cannot compete on an even playing field.  But you will know that even then, they cannot win in the long run, because you can adapt to their attacks faster and easier than they can adapt their attacks.  Start right now, right this very second, you will NEVER regret it.&gt;Rules:&gt;1.	Diet&gt;a.	Record calories every day.&gt;b.	Have a weekly menu&gt;c.	Net 0 or less calories everyday&gt;d.	No soda, fast-food, pizza, junk food&gt;e.	Eat only 3 meals, mostly vegetables&gt;f.	No more than 2 alcoholic drinks per day; only in a social setting&gt;2.	Exercise&gt;a.

But I finished strong.  I was between ordering a pizza (for the 2nd time in a day) and stopping playing games and doing *something*.  I did not order the pizza, but instead got up and started cleaning.  And kept going to cleaning out the fridge, boiling some eggs, preparing for tomorrow's tea and shake, and doing a full to-do list.That is the weird part of where I am now.  I know that I will be happier if I keep doing productive things.  And I know what those productive things are: find a job, build my business, work out, volunteer, go on dates...etc..  However, I feel like such a loser that I do not do them, but then it makes it harder to start later on.  This results in a positive feedback loop where I am lazy and gluttonous, causing me to not want to do the things necessary to not be lazy and gluttonous.  I suppose I need to just act like I am fine and I will come around.  Like the studies showing that smiling can cause happiness (rather then simply be symptom of it), I need to just act like I am confident and ready to crush everything.Everyday I am stuck in this loop is a day too many.  My life is quickly passing by and I really need to start being who I want to be, rather then waiting for him to emerge.

2r2u2n	-20258	1420179799	spirituality	Lost feelings of emotions?	Hey everyone, it seems to me that I have somehow gotten so 'strong' that I have lost my emotions. Over the past 3 years I have completely shifted my life, which is positive in many aspects. I have learnt how to not care what people think (unless what they say is reasonable), and I have also learned to not care about most things in life. That's not to say I'm careless, I only care about things that are worth caring about, and it so happens that most of the dramas in life drain your happiness.From this shift I have gathered an incredibly strong character, which has also negatively affected me. Seeing as I only care about the  things worth caring about, it means that there are only a select number of things that give me immense pleasure. When I feel emotions they are short lasting, if I'm sad it usually only lasts for around 1 hour at max. I am currently building towards living in the moment and I'm trying to find happiness in the small things in life, however it's hard due to my strong character.Does anyone else out there feel like this, or know how to help?Thanks :)
2r3ccc	-20258	1420197296	spirituality	My Spiritual / Supernatural Experiences	I have quite a few experiences that have happened to me over the past few years, and I thought that people would probably be interested in them.2 years ago I was brushing my teeth late at night around 2am or something, and I felt the presence of an entity. It touched me, and seeing as this was the start of my spiritual journey and I had no idea what was going on and therefore was scared. I laid on my bed for about 2 hours and tried going to sleep, however I could see wisps of smoke in my bedroom and when I tried falling asleep it kept telling me not to. This was basically what started my research into spirituality etc.The next year I was in Hawaii on a holiday. I was lying on my bed listening to music, and I was getting intense vibrations. I focused on these vibrations, and suddenly my draw across the other side of the room slid open. It was impossible for it to physically open, as no one else was in the room and I was too far away to affect it. This suggests that somehow from focusing onto the energy of the vibrations, I somehow transferred that energy and it ended up opening a draw across the other side of the room. This is basically self evidence for me (and evidence for you, if you believe me) that you can change the physical realm with your mind.Last year I had another crazy scenario. I was sitting in class listening to music and doing my work as per usual, and everything was normal. I had the album art of the song open on a window on my desktop. All of a sudden I visualised a picture of a girl in front of the album art of the song I was listening to. I knew that this had some sort of significance, and that I would probably meet her in the future. A few months later I was reading an article on Spiritscience, and I realised that you could click on the author's name to go onto their profile. I did this, and with a surprise I realised it was her. I obviously contacted her, and I asked her whether she knew the song that I was playing during the time of the visualisation. She said it sounded familiar, it could've been  the placibo effect, who knows. But that's not the point, I just found some girl who lives across the other side of the planet from a visualition I had while listening to music in class. There is so much more to this world than we know, and that's a crazy example.Oh, and also note that this brings up the question as to whether I have some sort of connection to music. I am really passionate about music and basically listen to it 24/7, so it would make sense if I had a connection with it. I also have auditory processing disorder, which means that my brain mixes up similar-sounding words. For example my brain will mix up "dog" and "log", so I will have to use logic to work out which one fits into the right context. I know that this is kind of irrelevent, but it could be possible that this hearing disability is a side-effect of having a strong connection to music, who knows.Another situation I've had was that I was at my friends house who lives in the hills. We were talking about the supernatural, and how they have had various UFO sightings near their house. Next thing you know, we actually spotted the UFO. It looked like a star, except it was bright red and as we spotted it, it slowly began descending below the horizon. This couldn't have been a flare, as it was hovering for a long time before it slowly began lowering; and it also couldn't have been a plane since we actually saw a plane fly past and compared it towards it. After this, I felt a shiver (you know those ones that go through your body), so I asked if everyone else did. All of us actually ended up having shivers at the exact same time, meaning we had a connection between all of us. This UFO could have been anything I really don't know, I've heard about all these alien beings before like the reptilians and some other race (I forgot the name). It could have been them, however I don't know if any of that is real seeing as there is so much controversy and a lack of evidence around it. The only way we can know for sure, is if you have self-evidence for it.A recent scenario I had was in a dream. I dreamt of a white pendulum shaped as a droplet, and I could feel it in my dream-hand. I knew it had significance, so I googled it to try and find it. I ended up finding it, so I bought it and now I have one :D I've always wanted a pendulum before, and now I have the one which is meant for me. I have barely used it, so yeah I haven't had any more encounters with it.That's all from me, can any of you relate to these? What experiences have you had?

2r79iy	-20258	1420290980	Parkour	[Question] Which soft tissue pathway to use when rolling?	I'm being told to roll inbetween the hip bone and the posterior superior iliac spine. See here for what I mean: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AECpmQKXrdkI'm also being told to roll like this, which avoids basically all bone contact of the lower back: http://parkourpedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/roll6.jpgWhat are the pros and cons of each? From what I know, seeing as the first option has a much narrower pathway, it could be risky in higher impact drops that you might hit them and therefore get seriously injured.Please give me good explanations, I'm learning and I'm still deciding which roll to learn :)
2r9tjm	-20258	1420346339	Parkour	[Question] Rolling through the 'soft tissue pathway'	When I roll through the pathway as shown in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AECpmQKXrdkI still barely semi-hit the edges of the PSIS and my hip bone. Is this a problem, or doesn't it matter since I'm still not directly making contact with these bones? I have a narrow pathway, so it's basically impossible for me to avoid them even if I roll more to the side.Will gaining more muscle/conditioning in this area eventually prevent this?Thanks :)

What are your other interests/hobbies/beliefs apart from spirituality?How old are you, where are you from?What are your main beliefs / what is the reason you study/practice spirituality?Personally I'm 17 years old, and I am from Australia. I do parkour, I enjoy studying business and technology, coding, art, and I am really passionate about music. I am actually in the making of multiple businesses, and one of them I have semi-released. It's called Vibite: http://www.vibite.com/I enjoy studying spirituality because I really enjoy improving myself. I also find it really cool how there is more to this world than the physical realm, and I have had many experiences that are self-evidence for this.

Imagine the experiences you would've had, it would completely change you.Is this actually possible? I want to do it, it'd be awesome. Imagine doing it every night?

I wanted to AP, however I just let the process happen itself. As I did this, I started getting 'voices' and hearing strange sounds such as a loud ringing in my ears. I'm not sure what happened after that, because I'm pretty sure I fell asleep.I already know that this ringing sound is a sign that you are really close to AP, however what are these voices? Was I hallucinating, or can they be a by-product of AP?Thanks :)
2tklzt	-20258	1422149960	LucidDreaming	One of my first lucid dreams	Last night I had a really cool lucid dream, and it's the second time in a very long time. I remember having 1 or 2 ages ago when I was a kid, but that's all.So it was a normal dream, and I decided to do parkour. I tried scaling a wall, however I failed and kicked back off the wall. I ended up flying back a couple of meters, and everyone around me thought that it was unbelievable. This is what made me lucid, so I tried flying around and it worked straight away. It was really realistic, and everything was in full color. I tried APing from the lucid dream, however I failed and it woke me up.

2vbs6g	-20258	1423508061	AstralProjection	I almost projected for the first time ever!	Ok, so I was having a very weird/cool dream. I actually thought that it was real because it was so cool. All I can remember from the dream is this:I always see numbers, and I mean legit like all the time. For example I will see combinations of 77, 44 etc. In the dream I saw a large combination as usual, which I'm pretty sure consisted of 77: 44 or something like that on a clock in the dream. I'm a spiritual person so I treat these numbers as affirmations in my own life.So from this, I asked my spirit guides to literally speak to me because I felt that I needed to hear their words as another affirmation. They instantly spoke, and all I can remember is that what they were saying was in a YouTube video in the dream, it was really weird... But it was still legit at the same time. I remember them telling me to 'love' or something and it felt like they talked to me for a few minutes. I can't remember the rest of what they said. I've never spoken to my spirit guides before, so this is the closest I've gotten to that so far.So from this very strange dream I somehow woke up, I can't remember how though. I heard the extremely loud high pitched sounds and my body was vibrating very high. I think I legitimately 'remote viewed' my room for a second, which could have been the vision from my astral body. I heard a voice from my mum telling me to wake up, so I assumed that it was the morning and that I had to get up for school. I ignored her and tried to AP, however for some reason the effects were gone. Also note that when I woke up, it was 5:05am, and I get up to go to school at 7am, so I must have hallucinated her voice. Also note that I always see combinations of 55 too, and look at the time when I woke up. That's no coincidence.I turned over and did a reality check with my phone, and it's real. I'm typing this Reddit post now so yeah.That was awesome and also pretty weird. I wasn't even trying to project, it just happened! I've been asking my guides to help me project ever since I learnt about AP, so maybe they literally listened to me, talked to me in my dream and helped me AP? Is it even possible for spirits to literally communicate with you in a dream?Tl;drRead it. That was fucking awesome.
2vlo9t	-20258	1423703592	NeoScavenger	Game Ideas	I bought this game over 6 months ago now, and I have to say that it is the most realistic survival game I have ever played. Seriously, the developer has thought of basically everything and made the gameplay as good as possible. There are even the most minor mechanics, such as not being able to put miniature items such as string in a shopping cart, because in real life it would fall through the holes of the steel frame.Anyway, I created this post for myself and others to share their ideas for features to make the game even better than it is now. These are my ideas:- Add multiplayer. I'm not sure if this would work due to the game mechanics, however it's still a possibility. It might just end up turning into a massive PVP arena like DayZ; however if you added mechanics that required teamwork etc. it might turn out differently.- I'm not sure if this is a feature since I haven't survived for long enough to see it if it does exist, however if it isn't already implemented you should add seasons. Not just summer/winter, also have autumn and spring, and change all the textures accordingly. For example in autumn, there will be dead leaves on the ground etc.- I've seen the list for possible future updates, and vehicles are one of them. Vehicles could actually be a good idea, and I don't think that they would be OP if you made fuel very hard to find. You could also make it so that you have to replace different parts of the vehicle too.- I haven't played in a while so I don't know if this has been fixed. Usually when you get shot by a gun, your or the NPC doesn't die or experience realistic injuries. If I was shot in the chest by a .308, it would completely tear my torso and my organs would bleed out. This needs to be fixed if it hasn't already, because it's kind of annoying to find a .308 when a crowbar is more effective.- Actually randomly generate the positions of special hexes. At the moment you can find tiles such as Zom Zoms really easily, because it's always North of the map.I can't think of much else, the developer has basically included almost everything :P

The longest playthrough I've had previously was about 15 days.I died because it hit winter, and all of my clothes happened to break at the same time. I had really good gear, and managed to earn around $4000 total. I tried scavenging to find clothes, however I didn't find anything. I was moving around with constant campfires because I had no other source of warmth. At the last few moments I found a guy, so I tried killing him to get his clothes. He didn't even drop any clothes, so I ended up dieing.That's NEO Scavenger for you!http://imgur.com/gallery/QmTdel8/new
2waxqz	-20258	1424260392	AstralProjection	Is there a such thing as genders in the astral world?	Seeing as gender is defined by your physical qualities, is there even such a thing as gender in the astral world?Do different souls have different characteristics that define them as different genders?If so, does that mean that if I reincarnate I can only go inside a male body because I am currently a male?

2xgkg1	-20258	1425131146	Music	Does anyone know where I can find the original for 'Kaskade - Feeling The Night '?	This song was rereleased in 2013, so I can't even find the original song. The new version is completely different and I don't like it at all.Here's a YouTube link to the song, however I want to buy/download it in HQ: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l2L7FLNX5EThanks :D
2xjnmq	-20258	1425197588	Meditation	If meditation is the absence of thoughts, then how is it possible to meditate on 'something'?	This is something that I've always been confused with.I've seen plenty of situations where people say that they are meditating on something; however doesn't that mean that I'm thinking? I thought that meditation was the absence of thoughts?For example, I might meditate on peace or problems with myself, however how can this be done without thinking?
2yfe1o	-20258	1425894579	AstralProjection	If you can time travel in the astral, doesn't that mean you can travel in the future?	If this is true, that's so fucking awesomeI want to travel in the future and fix problems before they even exist. Imagine viewing your future self walking around in the physical world? That would be so cool
2yo1kl	-20258	1426073410	NeoScavenger	A Game Idea for the Developer	Hey everyone,I actually only just thought of this now, and I think that it would be a really cool game. This game would have similar elements to NeoScavenger, so I thought that I'd post it here for the developer to see.Basically it's a game set in a medieval fantasy world, where you have a group of travellers (or a single traveller) who you have to get from one place to another. The graphics could either be modern and support super-detailed maps like The Elder Scrolls; or they could be similar to Neo Scavengers. The camera angle would also be similar to Heroes of Might and Magic / Sid Meier's Civilization, which would look awesome if the map were to be 3d. Imagine zooming in, and seeing extremely detailed terrain, and mountains surrounding the portrait. The camera could be similar to Diablo 3 too, either way would work.Regarding gameplay, you could add in heaps of quests/side quests that you can do. You could also add in random events etc, which could be text-based like NeoScavenger. While you are travelling you have to set up camp, hunt for food, barter, craft, and survive through harsh weather. You could even make the map not random generated, allowing an entire world similar to The Elder Scrolls to be explored. The city/town view should also be really detailed, so that you can see every building as if you were in it.It's an idea, and it'd be really cool :D
2ywnzf	-20258	1426252840	AstralProjection	This isn't AP, but this experience of mine will hopefully open your mind to new possibilities	I have quite a few experiences that have happened to me over the past few years, and I thought that most of you here would probably be interested in this specific example:In 2013 I was in Hawaii on a holiday. I was lying on my bed listening to music, and I was getting intense vibrations. I focused on these vibrations, and suddenly my draw across the other side of the room slid open. It was impossible for it to physically open, as no one else was in the room and I was too far away to affect it. I was 'internally' vibrating, and even if it was physical I wasn't creating an earthquake. I've never taken drugs (including alcohol) so I was completely sane.The only explanation for this is that I somehow the vibrations into kinetic energy, which opened the draw. This is basically self evidence for me (and evidence for you, if you believe me) that you can change the physical realm with your mind. I am 100% serious, I don't know why you would think that I would lie for no reason. Thousands of people are having similar scenarios such as this, and to simply brush them off as a 'coincidence' is ignorance in a universe full of possibilities.In fact, quantum physics actually proves all of this to be true. Studies have shown that when an object is mentally focused on, its atom structure is completely different to normal. If we can literally alter the world with our minds, imagine the possibilities?
2zc72h	-20258	1426589981	spirituality	Reality cannot be proven	Reality is merely our perception, everything that you see is in your mind; therefore if you change your mind you change your reality.This is literally impossible to prove wrong

I see that Humble Bundle has used torrenting for users to download DRM-Free games. I've never torrented before and I'm a noob at this, and I was wondering if anyone could give me some help or links regarding this.Thanks! :)
30w7cw	-20258	1427778150	web_design	Idea for a programming game	I just thought of a really cool idea. Someone could set up a series of fake websites that mimic other websites, such as Facebook or whatever. You team up with other hackers (or you can solo), and your goal is to try and steal data which you can sell on the 'black market'. You can use the money you earn to download new software and tools etc.There could be a team of 'good hackers' whose goal is to prevent the 'bad' hackers from stealing data. They have to set up protection systems, and earn money for whenever they catch a bad hacker.It's basically a hacking simulator, and it could actually have legitimate applications such as teaching coders better security practices etc.It'd be really cool, and if someone makes it that would be awesome!

32bzr6	-20258	1428847777	preppers	A very realistic and good game for those into prepping	If any of you are gamers, you should check out a game called NeoScavenger. Despite it being a game, it is still incredibly realistic, and is a really good game too.
32fg9g	-20258	1428922258	preppers	Prepping and parkour	I would recommend all preppers to learn parkour. Not only can you can overcome any obstacle and outrun anyone who chases you, you also gain both athletism and mental strength.It's something that anyone can learn of any age or fitness level. There are hundreds of tutorials online to learn the basic moves, and there's communities that you can join.I also forgot to mention that it's a lot of fun :D
32jj3k	-20258	1428999791	preppers	Homemade air rifles as survival weapons	IMO homemade air rifles are a really good weapon choice for a number of reasons: - they are easy to build - they can shoot any makeshift ammunition that fits in the barrell - they are incredibly cheap to buildYou can build them from any complexity. I've built a simple $30 air cannon with parts from the hardware store that can shoot at least 200 meters. Here's an example of a really nice one:  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH_nLs4esFMMy particular cannon is very simple, it's made of: - PVC pipe - PVC ball-valve - bike valve - PVC lidI have a length of PVC pipe as the barrell, which is connected to the ball-valve. The ball-valve also has a small length of PVC pipe connected on the other end, which is the air-tank. The air-tank has a PVC lid on it to seal it off. The PVC lid also has a hole drilled in it, with the bike valve siliconed in place to maintain an airtight seal.Using it is simple, you close the valve and push a projectile down the barrell with a rod, wooden dowel or whatever else you have lying around. You pump up the air tank to the desired PSI, I usually do about 80-90 PSI. To fire you quickly turn the valve, and the projectile incredibly fast.Obviously that's a very simple air cannon, however like in that video you can actually make complex designs. If you don't have any other weapons to use, consider making one of these.

34ejgg	-20258	1430404051	Meditation	Was this meditation?	Mid-last year I had an experience which I'm pretty sure was meditation, but there a few things I still question.I was lying in bed, and drifted off. About 45 minutes later I 'woke up' and felt kind tired. I definitely wasn't sleeping, it was as if I was in empty space the whole time, and I was thinking of absolutely nothing.Was this meditation? If meditation cannot be the absence of thoughts, then what was I experiencing?

34thng	-20258	1430743920	spirituality	How can you prove anything is real?	It's basically impossible to prove anything is real, since it's only real in your mind. We look to things such as spirituality as an explanation, however you could even argue that spiritual things aren't necessarily real as they are in your mind.Our existence doesn't even make sense. If something put us here, something had to put the thing that put us here; and therefore something had to put the thing that put us here. It creates an infinite paradox - one that logic simply cannot explain.With this in hand it does suggest that there must be other forms of explanation besides logic in order to comprehend our existence - however these are still technically in your mind.How do you even escape the 'self'? You can suggest spiritual practices etc. as a medium to achieve this; however those practices are still constitute our perception of reality.
34x1tx	-20258	1430810259	Music	Is there a YouTube channel / playlist that has videos to watch whilst listening to music?	I love music, and I've always thought that it would be awesome if there was a series of videos that you could watch whilst listening to music. Music creates visions in your mind, however it would be awesome if you could visually see these represented on film.I don't necessarily mean music videos, I just mean films of different random things. For example, the song 'Emancipator - Greenland' would go very well with a nature video in the misty alpines.

35oqek	-20258	1431415186	vegan	B12 supplement recommendations?	Before I ask, I would just like to point out that I only consume organic products, so I don't want anything that has additives. Thanks :)I was wondering if anyone has any B12 supplement reccomendations? I've been researching it, and methylcobalamin is illegal for some reason in Australia, so I can't use that. The only two other options are cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin.From what I've read, cynacobalamin is a cheap version of B12, and isn't high quality; and that hydroxocobalamin is a very good form of B12 as it is easily absorbed by our bodies.I've also heard that B12 can only be absorbed properly through the skin, injections or through sublingual administration.So from what I've gathered, I'm looking for a sublingual hydroxocobalamin supplement with no additives. Many vegans are also organic, so I'm hoping that someone here in this subreddit of 50,093 vegans can help.Thanks :)

With so many options, I just don't know how to experience every human experience all at once.

After playing for ages, that item will always stay there.How do open-world games save the positions of items on the map, and the state of the environment etc? What would be an example of an efficient system for rendering a dynamic open-world with these types of features?I was thinking that you could save the coordinates of each item, and the state of objects in the environment for each area. When you walk into that area, it grabs all the saved data and renders it correctly.

3cx6a6	-20258	1436629799	spirituality	I think I have found multiple soul mates. What do I do?	I think I have actually found at least 3/4 of my soul mates.I have always had the ability where I can look at anyone and just 'feel' who they are intuitively. I don't mean to necessarily  'judge' them, but I can 'feel' their energy and gather knowledge from that about their personality and true self. Apparently I'm an empath, and this can be one of their abilities too.I've tested this multiple times before, and it works. I have no idea how to explain how I do it, because it's basically impossible to translate into words.Anyway, with this technique I have been able to find people who I feel I have a connection with. With one person in particular, I 'felt' a connection with them so I approached them. They ended up having really similar traits to me, and their life story is basically almost the same as mine. I don't think that it would be unwise to consider them as a soul mate.The thing is that I believe that I have multiple soul mates, and I don't know if I should go with any of them. I don't feel the need to because I am comfortable alone, but I think it would be a great experience for both myself and them. The other thing is that I'm not sure if I should just not go with a soulmate, and wait for my twin flame who I may or may not meet in this lifetime.What are your thoughts? I know this is a personal decision that only I can make, but I thought that I should ask here to see if anyone else has advice, or has been in a similar situation.
3ddmbg	-20258	1436966109	AstralProjection	Has anyone ever found their twin flame while astral projecting?	For those of you who don't know what a twin flame is, it's basically the other half of your soul. You can Google it for more info.Has anyone ever found theirs in the astral plane? From what I imagine it should be easy, since there's such a deep connection between you and them, you should just be able to make the intention to teleport to them.

I hope your day has been nice so far.I was wondering if you guys ever feel this way.Sometimes when I see negative things, it feels like it drains out the energy from me. It happened to me today, and I did barely anything because of it and it sucks.I don't really know how to describe the feeling. My really good friend and I describe the feeling as 'mouldy'. I know haha it's a pretty weird name for it, but somehow we just know what we mean by it.I will try and write a good example because this is pretty vague. Do you ever just feel 'off' on some days? Where you just feel uninspired and put off, and there's just some weird negative feeling in you, and it's hard to get out of.I think this may because I'm an empath, but I'm resilient to things more than 95% of the time. The latter feels like my energy becomes drained from other things in the world.Do any of you guys ever feel this way? I want to find a way to both prevent and get out of it if it happens, because it's something that really sucks :)
3ff19s	-20258	1438445355	spirituality	Found my vision and lost it. I think I'm rediscovering myself	Ever since the start of the year, or maybe even a few months ago I felt like I had a fairly strong sense of purpose.I'll give you an overview of my recent life so you guys can get a feel of this post. My name is Daniel, I'm 17 and stopped going to school early this year to pursue my dreams. Ever since a few years ago I started disliking school more and more, and questioning what I was meant to be learning. 2013 was the main shift of my spiritual journey, which became much stronger in 2014 and basically governed all my actions. On both a spiritual level, and with logical reasoning I decided school wasn't for me and so I left.Back then I had a really strong sense of purpose, vision and motivation. It feels like it's died down now, probably because I spend all my time in my room working :P At times it grows really strong for a few hours, and I envision everything I want to do in my life with pure clarity and it dies down.Despite this I'm still unsure exactly what my purpose in life is. I know that I'm going to do huge things, and I've felt that way for a long time - but I'm still not sure exactly what it is that I want to do.It's really important that I work this out. I want to leave a really positive impact on the world but I'm not exactly sure what. I can even feel this void of the undiscovered vision and purpose I have now even as I write this.My question is this - what can I do to work out my vision and purpose here on Earth? I know that I'm heading in the right direction because I follow my intuition, but in order for me to put in 100% every single day to my life's work I need pure clarity. If it means meditating non-stop for 3 days straight - so be it. Our time here on Earth is so valuable, and I want to make every last bit worth it and get on the right track.Thanks guys. Have a nice day :)
3ff231	-20258	1438445756	AstralProjection	Let's lift our game up guys	I don't know, maybe it's just me but I feel like there used to be a lot more intriguing content here. Maybe it's because my interest in AP faded away, I don't know.I used to check here every day, but now it seems like there's something that has died. I joined this subreddit over 1 year ago now, and I remember being so thirsty for knowledge on AP.We should all start posting heaps more really engaging, original and exciting content. Things that make you really inspired to explore yourself and the astral realms. I think this will really help lift all of us up, and will inspire everyone, including people like me who haven't yet AP'd to do so.
3g97pn	-20258	1439050896	spirituality	How can I find my purpose?	I've developed to the point where I have the freedom of mind to know that I can do anything I want in life. The problem is that with so much choice, I've been finding it hard to work out what exactly my purpose is.I know that it's there, I just need to work out what it is. Even if it means meditating for an entire day non-stop, so be it. What can I do to work this out?
3ggz4n	-20258	1439218845	spirituality	Let's all share who we are :) who knows, maybe some of us will become friends	I think that most people here will be like-minded in at least some way or another. I only have a few good friends because I can only relate to few people around me. Maybe that will change here.My name is Daniel, I'm 17 YO and I'm from Australia.Things I like doing and stuff:* making things. I've been doing this ever since I was a kid, and I become lost in it* programming. This is something I've taken on recently because I needed to learn it to build the site for my business. It also ties into making stuff.* music. I love music, and I listen to it literally 24/7. I have wireless headphones too, so I can listen to it all the time in the house.* parkour. I actually really enjoy this, but I haven't done it in months because I'm a workaholic :P I should probably get back into it though, I need to exercise.* health and nutrition. I'm obsessed with this. Eating healthy is so important, the amount of crap in conventional food is crazy. I would eat 100% organic, but my parents won't.* I'm very spiritual. That's why I'm in this subreddit, right? I listen to my intuition in everything I do, and it's gotten me to where I am and will get me to where I want to be.* vegan. I never understood why people were vegan. After a 2 minute Google search I became one, and have been since late last year. * camping. I'm literally going to move to Canada just for the mountains. I barely go camping, but it'd be awesome to explore Canada. For some reason it just seems so surreal, my sense of freedom is urging me to move there.* playing games. Loved doing this since I was a kid. Games like The Elder Scrolls take you to an entirely new reality, I become lost in that game. * entrepreneur. Being an entrepreneur allows me to build and achieve anything - one of the highest forms of freedom there is. This is the only career I will take. It's either this or I live in the woods for the rest of my life.What about you guys?
3h7al3	-20258	1439735281	spirituality	What problems do you believe need to be solved in the world?	There are so many things that need fixing, there's no doubting it. The environment, global warming, poverty, animal cruelty, overpopulation - the list goes on.What do you believe are the most important issues that we must solve as soon as possible?
3hg613	-20258	1439907361	spirituality	sometimes I feel empty - what is it?	I don't know, it's weird. I just feel kind of empty sometimes, with a lack of emotions or anything.I think it might be because I've become so resilient to everything around me, and at times I just don't really feel much. After being bullied as a kid I've grown tremendously both as a person and spiritually. This has made me resilient to many of the petty things in life that normal people worry about. It's a good thing, but it can also be bad at times like now where I'm randomly emotionless.It's weird. I have the drive to do and achieve great things, but the universe is just so... It's so large and balanced. Why does what we do here on Earth even matter? To me it just seems like an illusion, it can feel like a video-game at times. I play along with it because life is awesome, but at times like now I just question it. What's the point? It feels like nothing matters, because I know that the universe is so perfect and will continue. At times like these I feel like my 'consciousness' or whatever you want to call it has risen high above normal, ridding myself of the human experience. What is even the point of seeking enlightenment? We came to Earth for the human experience, and at times I believe that it can rid ourselves of this. I don't know, I'm just sharing my thoughts.
3hgdzm	-20258	1439910778	AstralProjection	something I've found useful	While you're in bed, read a book. It makes me feel sleepy really quickly, which I can then use to try and active sleep paralysis.I personally find it hard to fall asleep otherwise, but reading a book helps, and it might help one of you guys.
3hisqp	-20258	1439945656	aetheism	A question for those who only believe in science	Before I ask this, please don't have a go at me, I'm only asking a question.Look at the creation of the universe. Religion says that god created the universe, and science says that the big bang or whatever created the universe. There is a flaw in this.How can the universe simply exist out of nothing? In order for something to be created, something needs to put it there. Something would have needed to put god / the big bang theory there; and something would have needed to put that person there too. It's an infinite cycle, one that makes absolutely no logic al sense.For this reason, it does suggest that there must be higher forms of understanding than pure logic in order to comprehend the creation of the universe, since the creation of the universe doesn't make any logical sense. It does suggest that there must be things 'supernatural', or 'out of this world' which we don't typically believe in. I won't go into detail with that, but I just want you all to realise that there's more to this world that primitive logic.And remember, these are only my thoughts - there's no reason to bash on me for this.

3i6993	-20258	1440399019	gamedev	Some of the largest problems game-developers face, and how to solve them	Hey everyone, it’s Daniel here from [Devarity](https://www.devarity.com/developers). These are some of the most significant problems for developers that I’ve discovered, and how to solve them.#**Unrealistic or overly-ambitious scope**We all want the make the perfect game with all the features in the world, however, this can be out of reach due to time and resource constraints. If you can deliver the bare-minimum and polished result for what you want to achieve in your game, I can guarantee that both you and your players will be far more satisfied with the end-result in comparison to a half-completed game.This is a far more effective approach to game-development, in comparison to trying to complete a million things at once. This can be closely tied to the quote:&gt; “If we try to be everything to everybody, we become nothing to nobody.”Set your bare-minimum end-result, focus on it, ensure that you deliver it and *then* you may have afforded yourself the time and resources to work on other features that are not required for the end-result.#**Delay or overly-optimistic schedule**Let’s face it - shit happens. We are constantly faced with problems that delay our schedule; however there *is* a way to work around this.When working on tasks, ensure that you allow more than enough time to complete it. If you complete a task early, you’re now working ahead of schedule and can move onto the next. This is a far more effective approach in comparison to assuming that the stars will align in your favor. Not only will you become far more productive; you will also feel like you are achieving your goals, rather than destroying your motivation due to failing unrealistic deadlines.#**Ineffective communication**Clarity in communication is a crucial factor for any team in any field. Imagine a game of football where every teammate is invisible to each other. It wouldn’t work out very well, right?Communicate effectively with your team, let them know what needs to be done, what is expected and what is required. Something that works great in achieving this, is to create a page with your top 3 objectives for the year, and 3 objectives for each quarter of the year. Ensure that these objectives are no more than a sentence each, and are as simple as possible. If they are complicated, your team will not have clarity and will loose track as a result. You can also use this main plan to create monthly, weekly and daily goals that will lead you towards your main objectives for the year. Keep this in hand, stick it to your wall if you need to and *always stay focused*.Ensure that you are all on the same page, and that no one is working on projects that aren’t center to your main objectives. Don’t be afraid to put your hand up if things ever start leading off-track, and to remind your team to maintain focus. If you do this, I can guarantee that you will be incredibly surprised with your productivity and effectiveness as a team.#**Ensure the bare-bones of your game are as polished as possible**Let’s face it - no one wants to play a broken game. As I mentioned earlier, “If we try to be everything to everybody, we become nothing to nobody.” Imagine a game with a tonne of incomplete and broken features; versus a game with far less but very polished features. I don’t think that I need to tell you which one you would want to play.Work out the features that are core to your game, polish them, ensure that they are great, and *then* move on to the rest if you have the time and resources.When performed correctly, all of these things will make a significant impact in the production of your game. Have fun with it, and let me know how it works out for you in the comments below :)
3i6qeu	-20258	1440412486	Devarity	[Gamedev] Some of the greatest problems game-developers face, and how to solve them

3il2zj	-20258	1440673858	spirituality	I'm here to create the universe	Before I begin, listen to [this song](https://soundcloud.com/stereofloat/intergalactic-method?in=vibite/sets/the-finest-vibes) on repeat and follow along. This may be a very long text - but stay with me. I was actually going to make this post last week, but hesitated because I wasn't absolutely clear. Now I am.This may not be structured or make much sense, but that's because I'm just writing down my thoughts.I've conciously been trying to find my purpose for about a month now, and this is it. It just feels right. I feel like I have so much freedom to do whatever I want in life, and that I can take so many paths. I don't feel like I fit into any particular path, I don't feel like I fit in as one particular person. I feel like I am everyone and everything.Have you ever had moments where you feel so connected - with a light-headed feeling, and chills rushing through your body? That's what I've been feeling like as I have been meditating on this over the past hour or so. I feel a sense of knowing, a sense of wisdom...With so much freedom, I was unclear as to what my life's purpose was. Now since I know that everything is me, I know that my life's purpose is to create the universe worth living in. Everything is a manisfestation of our thoughts. Everything is only real in our mind, therefore if we change our mind we change our reality. Everything around me, including the universe is in my mind, therefore I am the universe. As I write this now, I have manifested this computer. This computer is me. It sounds crazy, but it's true - and it's my job to create the universe I want to see - not what I *want* to see - but a universe so perfect that it can live without me.I'll tell you an experience I've had before. In June or July in 2013, I was on a holiday in Hawaii. I was lying on my bed, and became immersed in the song I was listening to *'Kill Paris - Falling In Love Again'*. As I became immersed in the song, huge vibrations started occuring in my head, so I focused on them - and a draw suddenly slid open across the other side of the room. No, I wasn't under the influence of drugs or alcohol. No, I wasn't hallucinating. It was *physically impossible* for this to occur - there was no one else in the room, and I was vibrating internally, not externally; and even if I was, I wasn't causing an earthquake. The only conclusion I can come to is that I somehow opened the draw with my mind. For me, this is basically self-evidence for me that we can alter the physical with our minds.Now, with that said, I need people. Well, I'm manifesting people right now as I write this. I felt like this was the first best place to go to, and it is.Who wants to join me on my quest? Literally, who wants to change not the world - but the universe? We can create, do or be anything we want to. This world we live in now is merely a manisfestation of our collective thoughts. The physical is a manisfestation of the non-physical, and the non-physical is a manisfestation of the physical. Everything is one, and it's up to us to create the universe we want to see.But what is that universe, and what does it look like? Maybe we should just live in the moment, and forget about it? What is it? We as a human race are evolving, or moreso becoming our true selves, and shifting into the highly spiritual beings we have always been. We can either create a utopia, a dystopia, or whatever - it's up to us. What about a world of pure love and happiness? Even then, I still feel like something is missing. I feel like everything is missing, and at the same time I feel like that's the way it's meant to be - I'm not sure.Am I source? I really feel like I am, but what do I want to create? How about you tell me what you want to see - you're only a manisfestation of me and you may have the answer.

2hah60	-20280	1411524792	MLPdrawingschool	Community challenge: InkTober	The year is beginning to wind down, school is winding up and October is nearly upon us. That means it's almost time for InkTober!  [](/ppwooo)[](/sp)What is InkTober? It's a month long challenge that has been going on since October 2009 in which you're challenged to create and share a piece of inked art each and every day.  From [the creator's website](http://mrjakeparker.com/inktober): &gt;Every October, artists all over the world take on the InkTober drawing challenge by doing one ink drawing a day the entire month. I created InkTober in 2009 as a challenge to improve my inking skills and develop positive drawing habits. It has since grown into a worldwide endeavor with thousands of artists taking on the challenge every year.  &gt;Anyone can do InkTober, just pick up a pen and start drawing.  And if you don't have the time to do it every day, you can still participate. Every other day or even just once a week - You can join in the fun just so long as you're creating!  Whether you have a brush pen and technical pens, or just a Bic pen and some printer paper, you can join! And if you don't have anything then you've got just enough time to go find something before the month starts.  [](/winkiepie)[](/sp)I'm hoping to get as many MLPDS members involved this year as I can. I'll be posting my work to tumbler tagged with #MLDPS-InkTober and I've already ~~blackmailed~~ convinced a few from the IRC to join, but what about you? [](/sp)[](/hypnopony "You know you want to...")

Any thoughts on working daily or pushing yourself to finish something and share it so often? Share your thoughts in the comments and post a piece or two that you've done that you particularly like.

354lhu	-20305	1430962634	SandersForPresident	Mostly pro-Bernie, but a little on the fence on a few issues; any insight?	Hey everybody. I've been searching and reading through this subreddit for a while now attempting to address my specific concerns about Bernie, but I haven't really been satisfied so I thought I'd ask the community directly. On just about everything, I'm pro-Bernie. I'm a registered Democrat and two-time Obama voter, although I trend a little bit libertarian. I generally love the guy. My concern is about the economy, though. I'm an entrepreneur, and something of a futurist, and I'm an advocate for the tech sector, decentralization, and the free enterprise system generally. I have no issue whatsoever with government involvement in these things, but I strongly support private initiative in them also. I'm a Silicon Valley guy, basically. As far as I can tell, the Nordic model fits this great; the economic system of most of Scandinavia is a relatively free market economy with somewhat high taxation rates financing a robust social safety net. This effectively welfare capitalist set-up sounds ideal to me, and I know Bernie has supported the Nordic model, but I'm still a little unsure. I haven't seen much indication that Bernie shares the same skeptical feelings towards regulation as the Nordic model. Does anyone know how Bernie would plan to approach private initiative and technological innovation in industry? How would companies like 23andMe or something from the Elon Musk empire, companies that attempt to decentralize, personalize, or revolutionize technology for fairly progress goals, fare under a Sanders Administration? Or start-ups generally?Apologies if this is a convoluted or silly question. I know that my inability to find many details means that this just isn't a central area of concern for Bernie, but it is for me. I agree with Bernie on his personal concern areas, so I just wanted to see if anyone knew how he felt about mine.**Update: Thanks for the responses so far! A lot of my questions have been answered and concerns quelled. I'm feeling pretty all in for Bernie!**
35z89r	-20305	1431631452	Libertarian	The burden of history?	So, I have a question that's been bothering me about contemporary libertarianism, and I thought I'd respectfully propose it to /r/libertarian. Like my flair suggests, I'd consider myself a libertarian, but I've noticed that we, as a political community, have a lot more to say about what we'd have done differently than what we'd do next when presented with political inequities. I believe strongly in the market system, and that the market can cure a lot of ills, but I also feel like we can't ignore centuries of market distortion and unjust power differentials that state collusion has given us. I know how we'd have done it differently, but the way it happened is that our society has been totally shifted by state intervention for as long as the nation state has existed.So, my question is, what can we, as libertarians, do about systemic problems caused by centuries of state collusion? It's difficult to look at the state of race relations in America and not see a history of gross violations of liberty that have fundamentally and artificially altered the social structure, or to look at the economic structure of the internet and ISPs and not see artificial monopolies and restrictions that were put in place by government but would not necessarily disappear in its absence (since it's, y'know, already there). Are there situations where mild government action can help temporarily redress areas fundamentally distorted by intervention? This is a nagging question that I've been having as I try to approach libertarianism as a practicable series of solutions, not just spot-on philosophy and fun slogans.Thanks in advance for your thoughts and civility.

38gc6f	-20305	1433379147	learnprogramming	Does anyone know of a community for people from non-CS backgrounds teaching themselves to code?	There have been relevant threads and things here and on /r/cscareerquestions, but I'm wondering if anyone knows of a dedicated community of autodidacts with non-CS backgrounds to connect and share experiences / opportunities. For context, I'm 24 and finishing a BA in social sciences, and I'm currently teaching myself Python. I don't have the money to continue formal CS education right now, but I'm fascinated by the subject and pursuing it loyally on my own. So I guess what I'm just looking for, if anyone has any tips, is a community of people more like myself: without formal training in CS, from an unrelated background, trying to learn and grow in the field. I'm having trouble connecting with people in similar situations. Any ideas? Thanks in advance, everybody (also thanks in general for keeping up this sub; it's been a huge help to me).

uqclu	-20314	1339100607	askscience	How come incest-based genetic mutations in animals is not a problem?	Say you stock a pond with 4 turtles and 4 fish. These animals will live in this pond for their entire lives and only encounter other turtles or fish from the off-spring they produce. Because you stocked the pond, the chances are high that you bought all the turtles and fish from the same source, which means the turtles and fish could already be genetically related (brother/sister.) Even if not, they would be forced to be be breeding with a really close relative within one generation.  The gene pool is not diverse at all.That said, how come you don't see man made lakes with turtles and fish with extreme mutations or physical defects like we would if humans reproduced this way?  Even taking into account people would stock their pond with more than 4 turtles or fish, it still leads to a gene pool exclusively fixed to a low amount of initial genes that would seem counter-productive to a species trying to survive.

You obviously don't get that high number, but you get higher than you would have due to making your boss mentally do a benchmark of that high number and any amount less than that does not seem as significant, so you end of getting a higher raise than if you did not provide this false benchmark.I hope that makes sense, and I feel like I read about this within the past 2 years and my hour spent Googling this has failed me.  Please help me locate this study (or even news article) so I can get back to reading Reddit and stop looking for this! Thanks!

I'd like to create an alternative chicken franchise that helps supports my interests: atheism, science, and social freedoms. (But not like Los Pollos Hermanos, people)We create a similar menu, create a franchise, and let people vote with their money by supporting one or the other.  Percentage of profits fund science, atheism, gay rights, and more.We can crowd source names, menu items, principals, and more.  If this can get off the ground, I'd personally open up the first one in NYC. (I have owned a restaurant before.) Anyway, I'd like to hear your thoughts, see if you can donate your skills, time, connections, ideas, and more to get this off the ground.  Back of the envelope, I think I'll need a minimum of $250,000 to launch this, so it'll have to be a huge group effort.  I'll start a kickstarter campaign if you guys think this is a worthy cause.Thanks!

I'm excited as my [new book trailer](http://youtu.be/J9eih1cCJsU) just released for my upcoming job-hunting and career book, "The Subversive Job Search." Actually a year ago Reddit inspired me to write my second book [after reading this thread and leaving a comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/oywrl/what_are_some_not_so_well_known_but_common_and/c3l6se1?context=3).I'm often asked how to get a non-fiction book published. The main key is your platform, or the way to look at it,  your sales funnel.  The wider the net/audience you have access to, the more likely the book will sell well.So before you even submit your book proposal to an agent:* Grow the largest audience you can on Twitter, Facebook fan pages, YouTube subscribers, email newsletters, etc.* Prove you are press friendly by getting your name in the press for things related to your book (your niche business, your consulting advice, your mentoring, etc.) Signing up at HelpAReporterOut.com is a good way to get your name in some publications.* Teach classes, hold seminars, or have public speaking gigs as often as possible If you have a growing fan base and a huge Rolodex of contacts, you'll probably have better luck selling your non-fiction book to a publisher. For questions about the trailer, non-fiction book trailers are a tough beast to wrangle, but I think it came out alright thanks to my friends at [Pig Apple](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Pig-Apple/472355076149070).  They usually do fiction book trailers and other odd gigs.

I lost most of my wealth in the real estate crash, got depressed, and then spent money trying to make myself happy. That didn't work out too well.My new book **[The Subversive Job Search](http://www.amazon.com/Subversive-Job-Search-Overcome-Six-Figure/dp/1601632576/ref=la_B001JS0C64_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367589721&amp;sr=1-1)** is about how I reinvented myself as a corporate guy and went from unemployment to a $40,000 entry level starting salary, and within 24 months turned that into a $190k a year career.  My book came out 10 days ago and it has had a HUGE effect on the economy because CNN is reporting this morning that the [April job reports are skyrocketing](http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/03/news/economy/april-jobs-report/?hpt=hp_t1).  (Edit: Guys, this is a joke. Thought it was obvious.)Seriously, I'm happy to help if you have questions about how to make more money, get a job or improve your career, or get started in real estate.Fun facts about my books that has nothing to do about money:* **[The Subversive Job Search](http://www.amazon.com/Subversive-Job-Search-Overcome-Six-Figure/dp/1601632576/ref=la_B001JS0C64_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367589721&amp;sr=1-1)** is the first non-fiction [lipogram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipogram) ever published. I wrote the whole book without using the letter z. (Harder than you think.)* My sister is the first person to have two books specifically "not dedicated" to her in the book's dedication. (I love her, just for fun.) Poor quality [pic](http://screencast.com/t/iMkDwgAC8) here.* The idea of writing a second book came from [this Reddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/oywrl/what_are_some_not_so_well_known_but_common_and/c3l6se1?context=3).* I can confirm writing books is not a way to make a million bucks. But if you don't like me, you can **[buy a ton of my books](http://www.amazon.com/Alan-Corey/e/B001JS0C64/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1)** to prove me wrong.
1e2i04	-20314	1368195220	IAmA	I am the author of "The Subversive Job Search" and I can help you find a job.	In 24 months I went from unemployed &gt; $40,000 entry level job &gt; Working for free &gt; $70,000 job &gt; $190,000 job.Throughout this process I sent out over a thousand resumes, went on over 30 interviews, and spent a lot of time negotiating salaries. I've learned a lot about how to stand out in the sea of applicants.All of my subversive tips are in my new book **[The Subversive Job Search](http://www.amazon.com/The-Subversive-Job-Search-ebook/dp/B00C46WXSK)**, but a few of them are:* **Appear like you have a job, even if you don't.** You know when you ask a girl out and she says no because she has a boyfriend? What happens? You end up liking her more! This occurs because your taste in women has now been confirmed by a third-party.  The same goes with employers and job applicants. Having a company currently vouching for you helps you stand out.  So how do you find a job? Freelancing! Go to websites Elance.com or Odesk.com and create a profile today. The pay rate is low, but you are doing this for appearance so when asked in an interview “Are you currently working?”, you can say yes.* **Be a Jill-of-one-trade and not a Jack-of-all-trades.**   As you get more desperate, you will start padding your resume. It's a natural temptation to keep adding experiences or skills that you have, but not exactly apply to the job you are applying for. Instead of appearing well-rounded, you actually appear as someone who can’t do any one thing exceptionally well. Having  workflow responsibilities and experiences that repeat on your resume makes you appear as an expert, veteran, and top candidate. Again, like most things, it's about appearance.* **SEO your resume.**   Make it easy for employers to find you on LinkedIn and in resume databases by using searchable keywords and phrases on your resumes.  Also YOU MUST HAVE A LINKEDIN PROFILE. It's a necessary evil on your job hunt. No one will ever search LinkedIn for “Master of Business Administration”, but would search "MBA". Think of how someone would search to find you. * **Sell your future self.**  It’s best to assume your resume is going to sit on someone’s desk untouched for a long time. To avoid someone having a stale resume of yours, commit to earning an industry certification or an educational equivalent by listing credentials that you could possibly earn within the next six months on your resume now.  Not only does this solve the stale resume issue, but you now have a six month lead time on other candidates.  This act also forces you to commit to following through on career-improving steps you might not have ever done. * **Have a consistent career-focused online identity.**  All your public facing online profiles should tell the same story. If you are “Mike Smith the accountant on LinkedIn” but “Mike Smith the accountant and photographer” on Twitter, then you are muddling your career brand and hurting your chances of being hired.  Hiring managers now have to ask, “Will you leave us if your photography career takes off?” Regardless of your answers,  you’ll probably be passed over for someone that comes off a less risky hire. I'm happy to help you on your job search, whether you are unemployed or want a better career. Ask me questions and I'm happy to help! Everyone is in a unique situation, but with some very minor tweaks you can improve your job search.  I call my tips subversive, as some of them are counter-intuitive and/or go against conventional advice.  I hope you find them helpful.  Actually reading the [r/jobs](http://reddit.com/r/jobs) inspired me to write my book in the first place!  [Verification for Mods](https://twitter.com/alancorey).

I'm sure the story is great, but I am just not enjoying myself. Would I be missing anything if I just watched cutscenes on YouTube?

I can then type the subreddit URL directly into the address bar, www.reddit.com/r/mysubreddit, and it works just fine and since I was previously logged in, it has no issues and displays no forbidden page and certainly not the odd forbidden page with the orange box and no subreddits across the top.The custom domain is [links.ideasofjustice.com](http://links.ideasofjustice.com) and the subreddit is [houseofjustice](http://www.reddit.com/r/houseofjustice)Thanks!

Earlier this week, I got a Ducky DK9008G2 Pro that I ordered from /r/mechmarket, and immediately loved it. But why did I love it more? Was it the luxurious thick PBT caps, compared to the janky WASD ones?Well, yesterday, I got my first MassDrop order, the [two-tone doubleshot ABS caps](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/two-tone-doubleshot-abs-keycaps?mode=guest_open), of which I ordered both colors. Ah, perfect, let's mount these matching caps on both boards as a control, then I can actually compare just the boards.So I did. And in comparing the boards, I really can't decide which I like the feel of more.**WASD V2*** Purchased new with warranty* Unobtrusive numlock light* Plastic of the body feels kinda tinny and cheap* Costar stabilizers* I was noticing some pinginess with the WASD caps, but it seems to have gone away with the new caps?* DIP for Dvorak (which I use)** Ducky DK9008G2 Pro*** Purchased used, no warranty* Bright-ass blue LED on the numlock key* Plastic body feels nice* Cherry stabilizers (which I think I prefer)* 4 macro keys for artisans (one day)Based just on this, I'm leaning toward the Ducky. I should mention that both boards are 104-key ANSI with MX Clears. Also, my Caps key keeps sticking on the Ducky, but I don't have a puller at work to try to troubleshoot it.Am I missing anything? Anything else I should be considering?Edit: Why is my list not being formatted?

So I'm hoping all you P2 owners can help me out.I'm a Dvorak typist who also swaps `/Esc and \\/Backspace. It's my understanding that the main layer is not programmable, right? So if I program Layer 1 with my two customizations, can I just stay in Layer 1 all the time? If I DIP-switch to Dvorak, will that affect the Layers, or will I need to manually program Dvorak to that layer? (Oh, I guess that's a P3-specific question that we don't know the answer to yet.)Is there any way to backup/restore the programming?

346zzr	-20328	1430252311	MouseReview	Fingertip grip + Dvorak	I know, seems odd to mention keyboard layout on a mouse board. I just returned my Roccat Tyon to Amazon, as it did not work as expected. I'm a Dvorak typist, but I use a combination of hardware and software remapping. The Tyon worked great on computers where the OS was set to Qwerty, but after much trial and error, I gave up trying to get it to work in Dvorak mode.I'm looking for a mouse with programmable buttons that I can configure to some simple shortcuts, namely cut/copy/paste. I need those shortcuts to be saved in the mouse so that I can connect it to any computer and they will continue to work. I realize that I will probably need to use different profiles depending on the keyboard layout of the OS, and I'm fine with that. (For example, on a computer with a hardware Qwerty board where the OS is set to Dvorak, I need to physically press Ctrl-I to get the computer to see Ctrl-C.) I'm not picky about the button layout, (Naga-style is fine), DPI, LEDs, weight, or wheel style. I use a fingertip grip.tl;dr: * Programmable buttons* Works with different keyboard layouts* Fingertip grip

Is it awareness, a public apology, a blacklist of writers that can't be trusted anymore or getting advertisers to pull support from the websites or a mixture of all of them. I just want to know the end goals of this movement before I am fully on board.EDIT: Thanks for the replies, it seems that the whole hashtag movement wants new ethics policies for games journalism and that i can agree with.

2jw334	-20354	1413901952	KotakuInAction	How come this KIA doesn't promote the sites that follow journalism ethics?	I've tried looking around the wiki and sidebar and it doesn't show any gaming websites or youtubers that follow the ethics. Or is it that none of the sites have come out and followed them. You could argue that I should find them on my own and figure out if they are ethical on my own but i think you should at least recommend a few with a disclaimer and reminder to check up on their ethics before becoming a part of their viewership.EDIT: Thanks for the replies, seems like there was a list after all and i was too blind or something https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/wiki/index/lists

3d87x1	-20354	1436858382	anime	[Discussion] Why the censorship in Prison School is offputting for me (No Spoilers)	With the airing of the first episode a lot of people wrote about how bad the censorship was. This was met with a brush off comments of, "why don't you just watch porn" or "you guys have been saying this show was more than just an ecchi and no you complain cause its censored."For me having read the manga and knowing whats to come, some of the jokes use ecchi scenes to the benefit of the comedy. The show uses a lot of shock humor with their ecchi and they are constantly pushing their limits and reader's expectations. The censorship in the anime hinders a lot of the shock value of the jokes cause instead of being shocked by whats being shown, you're looking at a screen with half of it covered in white light. Its sort of like a person telling a really funny joke but then they mess up the punchline, you get the concept and you might still be funny but it won't be as good.The closest thing i could think of would be the [fight scene in "Borat"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qV_DmT2msM), It's censored on youtube but if you watch the movie it isn't and its a whole lot funnier and disturbing.So it's not really that I just want to see ass and titties, its only part of the reason. Also I totally get that its probably cause of their air time that they can't go uncensored but whatever, hope the blu-rays come soon.

3g2vz1	-20359	1438912378	crusadersquest	Rachel - a guide	I’ve been using Rachel a lot since getting her SBW, and she has become one of my favorite and go-to characters for PvE and FoS (and occasionally WB).  Unfortunately, I haven’t seen a lot of information here on her, and most of what I’ve seen is negative, so I’m writing this guide to shed some light on an amazing character.  If you're skeptical, please skip ahead to the videos below under 'Strengths.'---Rachel is a well-balanced, glass cannon, 3 chain-chaser who boasts [high sustained damage potential](http://i.imgur.com/ebiNhMb.jpg) with a moderate wind-up time with her SBW, and excellent crowd control potential with tMR without a SBW.  As such, she’s best played somewhat differently with her SBW than without.**Play style:**---**With SBW:*** Shadow Mage is your go to skill.  She fills the same role as Naz, but with much better SP generation and damage potential, but without the debuffs or knockback.  Rachel does less damage per block than Naz, but will be able to have many more Shadow Mages. **Without SBW:*** 6 ★ Superior Staff with Resist Pen/Attack Power/Attack Power or Crit Damage (Rachel has naturally high crit chance)* Transcended Mana Recycle is what you want.  With her long-lasting large hit box, and fast SP generation, she can lock down enemies more effectively than Archon, but does less damage per second.**Skill block:**---&gt; Calls for countless bats, dealing magic damage equal to (56/175/280)% of attack power based on the chain number.* Creates a cloud of bats that is capable of hitting numerous enemies simultaneously and lasts 2 seconds* The cloud from a 3-chain, or a SBW proc 480% block, is 3x larger than a 1- or 2-chain cloud* This damage is spread over 7 ticks, so the damage per tick is (HA x chain modifier) / 7* With tMR, each tick triggers the 1 second stun. The 7th tick occurs at the end of the 2 second cloud, meaning Rachel stuns enemies in a large area for 3 seconds.  Additionally, the bats appear almost instantly (no waiting for the meteors to fall before the stun activates as with Archon)* When her SBW procs, the chain modifier changes to 480% regardless of chain length * (**Note:**  Noticed this when crunching numbers for this guide: the SBW appears to be bugged as it’s only making the next block 315% (the 5★ value) instead of 480%).**Passive:**---**Her passive functions in two (separate) ways:**&gt; If the Hero uses its block or is healed by a skill, the Hero’s attack power will increase by 10% for 5 seconds and recover 4 SP.* The 10% AP buff is virtually always present and does not stack, so for all intents and purposes she has 10% more AP than what is on her character sheet.* The interesting bit is that she gains 4 SP *every time she is healed* with *no cooldown*, which when paired with the right team, can mean **near-continuous SP generation**.&gt; The effect of the block(s) used after an ally's chain-3 skill will be tripled. (Activates once every second)* This is worded poorly, and does not mean that her damage gets a straight x3 modifier.  Instead, it means that after an ally 3 chain, for one block, she gets 30% increased AP instead of the regular 10%. **SBW:**---&gt;(50% chance when Passive Activated) Next skill block enhanced (480%, Magical, Entire party heal +10%)* Preferred roll is **A/A** (Rpen/HA), but with her already high damage potential and low survivability, **A/D** (Rpen/DR) may be a good alternative.* Can proc from both halves of her passive (ally 3-chains or heals/using own block).* If the SBW procs, AND the block is used following an ally 3-chain, changes the animation from a stationary bat cloud to a rolling cloud of bats that hits off screen.  This projectile does not have a range limit, and will hit every enemy in the current wave regardless of how far off screen they are.* (It is possible to have a 480% damage block proc as a normal cloud of bats if not used as a 3-chain chaser).**Pairing &amp; Synergy:**--- **Dara*** Rachel's BFF.  Dara heals for each tick of damage an ally does.  Rachel can hit each enemy in her cloud of bats up to 7 times, and generates 4 SP each time she’s healed, so that’s **28 SP a block *per enemy*.*** For example, if Rachel hits a group of 4 enemies with Dara’s heal active, she will generate up to **136 SP *from a single block*.**   (4 enemies x 7 ticks x 4 SP per tick = 112.  + 20 SP for the normal SP generation, plus an additional 4 SP from her passive for using her own block)* However, this means the third party member with Dara and Rachel has to provide 3 chains to proc both of their passives.**Yeo*** Rachel likes heals, and likes 3 chains, so Yeo is a natural choice.  Also pairs well with the Dara/Rachel combo for a very strong team.**Roland (with AoP):*** Of all the tanks, Roland gets along with Rachel the best.  If he’s leader, he can reliably keep AoP active to protect Rachel and (with his passive block generation) keep a steady stream of 3 chains for her.  The heals are just the icing on the cake.  Roland (L)/Dara/Rachel makes for a lower damage potential, but higher survivability, team than Yeo (L)/Dara/Rachel.**Mundeok (with SoI):*** While having less synergy with Rachel than Roland, due to his strong passive he is capable of producing higher overall DPS than a Roland team, while maintaining strong(er?) protection.  With Mundeok (L)/Yeo/Rachel, Yeo and Mundeok both provide a constant stream of 3 chains for Rachel, and with Rachel's block now counting as 3 chains, her SP generation remains high.**Strengths:**--- **PvE*** [Tundra 5-30 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3Cfv7_Lqss)* If the first wave of enemies can hit Rachel in the back of the party, she may die quickly.  But once she gets rolling with SP generation (and near constant heals from Dara), she can survive anything that won’t one-hit her (which can be mitigated with Sera or Anut).  Oh, and she also melts faces.**FOS*** [FOS 10 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOqCftr3sC4)* I was never able to reliably clear FOS 10 until I got Rachel’s SBW.  I thought Yeo’s SBW would be necessary, but RNGesus saw fit to bless me with Rachel’s instead.**Weaknesses:**--- **Colosseum:*** Long wind-up time, low survivability, and reliance on ally 3 chains make her a bad choice for PvC. With a tank to cover her (Alex/Joan/Mundeok) and a 3-chain healer (Yeo/Woopa) she might be viable, but there are far better teams.**World Boss:*** Survivability is Rachel’s biggest problem in WB.  Her HP pool is just too low, even when maxed, to survive hits from WB reliably.  With a shield from Korin or Drake she might fare better, but there’s no real synergy there. * Fenriruth is particularly difficult, as the early poison cloud can quickly kill Rachel before a steady steam of heals is started.  Having Himiko as a healer will mitigate this.--- I hope this helps you, and answers any questions you may have had concerning her.  If it didn’t, I’ll do my best to answer in the comments below.  Or if you have something to add, please tell me below and I'll add it to this guide. Lastly, Rachel is set as my main hero, so if you would like to try her SBW out for yourself in PvE, feel free to add me as a friend in game (**dwilx**)!

1rvkxs	-20360	1385947226	learnmath	[College Calculus] I think it's an optimization problem.	I think this is an optimization problem where I'm supposed to find the smallest distance between the point on the graph and the point (4,0) on the x-axis. I'm looking for confirmation and maybe someone could point me in the right direction if I'm incorrect. [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/CiRkfQB.jpg)"Find the xy-coordinate on the graph of y=sqrt(x), nearest the point (4,0) in the xy-coordinate plane. Note: L is the distance between the point (x,y) and (4,0), where L is calculated using the distance formula as follows, L=L(x,y)= sqrt((x-4)^2 + (y-0)^2)
1wo2vb	-20360	1391197578	StLouisRams	How attached are we to Willie Hayes?	There's been a lot more talk about us taking Clowney due to Chris Long's impending cap hit. How do the rest of you guys feel about Hayes? He got 5 sacks this year and 7 last year as a back up, so I feel like he'd make excellent trade bait to a team like ATL instantly boosting there pass rush. Not to mention helping our cap situation (albeit slightly) so we can possible sign Saffold or someone else if we'd rather get cheap draft talent. Thoughts?
1yqukn	-20360	1393199581	learnmath	[Calc II] I don't understand the setup of a few of these problems.	I'm doing a study guide for an upcoming test and a few of these are throwing me off with the wording. I'm used to just numbers on the page as opposed to a wordier problem. Help is much appreciated. #1) Suppose a projectile is projected upward in R space (one-dimensional space) and subjected to the pull of gravity, where the acceleration due to gravity is constant and givenas a(t)= -g. Note t is a measure of time and g is the gravitational constant. Find the velocity and position function for the projectile with respect to time, if the initial velocityis v(0)= v_0 and the projectile is projected from position h(0) = h_oIs this just the anti-derivative of a(t) and so on for acceleration, velocity and position? #2) A solid sphere with a diameter of 8 in is a solid of revolution whose total volume is (4/3)pi(4)^3  inches^3. Suppose a hole 2 inches in diameter is drilled through the sphere, passing through its center. What is the exact volume of the remaining sphere after the hole is drilled?I just don't really know how to set this problem up at all. I was thinking I would have to use volume by shell method, but I don't know how to develop the integral calculation.#3) Suppose region R is contained within the graph of x^2 +(y-4) = 1 is revolved around the x-axis. What is the exact volume for the solid of revolution?Is this a circle and when I revolve it around the x-axis it would make a donut shape? I was also thinking I would need volume by shells and trig. sub. My best guess for the integrand would be 2pi*x [x^2 - (y-4)^2 -1]Any suggestions would be appreciated.

So, I love Coughlin and hope he stays in NY for as long as he wants, but watching the game yesterday I have to wonder what he's thinking leaving OBJ in as PR. It seems insane to me given how much injury happens during PR. He's a fantastic receiver, but he's not even a particularly good PR and it just opens him up to a lot of extra injury.Are there any plans to change that?

djr18	-20377	1285634741	PS3	6 hours with Playstation Move	Just a little overview of my experience.I'm a casual 23 year old gamer, today I bought the PS move kit, an extra wand and the Sport Championship game. 1st impressions me and my wife tinkered with the Eyepet demo and it was quite fun interacting with it. Although I'd get bored quickly, my niece would love it! I'm obviously not the target audience, but enjoyed the demo.Next up, tumble, got a bit bored and frustrated, might come back to it as I wasn't in the right frame of mind.Start the party demo was fun, I do like how the camera gets used to show my living room on screen and to change the glowing orb to rebid racket, shower head or hairdryer in the games (last two were in eye pet)Next up, sports champion has been great and worth the £25. I tried archery first and thought the controls were great, table tenor was accurate too, and the frisby golf is quite original. Only downside was lack of character customisation.Next up I played the heavy rain demo and the controls worked perfectly. After playing the game already to death I wouldn't bother getting it again for a run-through, but to HR virgins move would add alot too the experience. Your ment to play the game with a wand and a navigation controller, however you can just use a SIXAXIS in your left hand as it's the exact same layout as navigation and saves you £30Tomorrow I'm going to give Tiger Woods and echochrome a play.So far I'm enjoying it, and looking forward to resident evil 5 (never played it) and The fight. Although as more games come out it will be interesting how they use this technology or port it to older games... God of war 3 would be great IMO with the navi + wand setup. Sorry in advance for spelling/grammar, I'm on my phone and autocorrect isn't the best and I'm too lazy to read through.

Examples - Am Pentatonic Descending 4 notes    E--8--5--------5--------------------------|    B--------8--5-----8--5------8--5---------|    G------------------------7----------7--5--|Am Pentatonic String Skipping    E--8--5-------------------------|    B----------------8--5-----------|    G--------7--5-------------------|    D------------------------7--5---|Anyway, after a full week practicing these exercises with all 5 shapes i didn't feel any different.Earlier today i thought id put on a few backing tracks to play along too and started "Let it be" by The Beatles... and i rocked! For the first time i improv soloed all over the fretboard, discovered some cool licks and it all just fell into place, then i done the same to a few other backing tracks and felt great.Best thing i discovered is that its the exact same shapes/notes for Major pentatonic, just a different position.Next up to learn, is [what this kind gent said on my older post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/dt1bz/learning_scales_what_is_the_best_way_to_learn_a/c12p6v7)**TL;DR **- Scales = Wax on/Wax off | Killer improv solo's = Karate | [jeffffff](http://www.reddit.com/user/jeffffff) = Mr Miyagi

I have always loved Sonic games... first one I owned was on the Game Gear and last one i bought was Sonic Adventure 2.Last month i decided to buy Sonic Adventure on PSN, replayed it and enjoyed every moment of nostalgia that came back to me, the story, music, sounds, characters and the terrible voice acting... it was perfect and hasn't aged that bad.I haven't really been following Sonic 4 much, but upon completion of Sonic Adventure today, i looked up the wiki for it...&gt;"Sonic the Hedgehog 4 is set shortly after its predecessor Sonic &amp; KnucklesCool, a sequel from one of one of my cherished childhood games, I couldn't be more wrong...**Things wrong with Sonic 4 - *** Controls - He is very slugish to move* Story - It is practically non-existent, a few little cutscenes bridging the end of S&amp;K to this game would have been nice.* Characters - Just Sonic, Eggman and old enemy's, some re-styled* Levels - Old style levels with little new twists - again, no story element* Music - Awful midi-esque on 20second loops from what i can tell. * Powerups - Just Shoes, Invincibity and protective bubble. Would have liked to see Water/Fire/Lightning shield come back.* Lack of innovation - Some cool original ideas in the levels, but not enough* No Multiplayer modes* All levels unlocked after you complete 1st level... WTF?To me, this feels like a rehash of Sonic 1 with updated GFX. Everything else is kinda pants about it. Its a shame they didn't offer a demo, as just 1 level would have put me off buying. Now my £16.50 less rich, due to the fact i had to splash out £6.50 on Pixeljunk Shooter to make up for my bad decision.I really want Sonic Team to pull their finger out of there asses and make a decent game. New Super Mario Bros on wii is excellent compared to the original Super Mario Bros. It felt retro and new at the same time, added the multiplayer which is fun, loads of new features and have taken the best bits off all the previous Mario games and made a great one.Maybe things will improve by Episode 2... Thoughts?**TL;DR** - [The Sonic Cycle](http://gamesareevil.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/sonic_cycle.jpg)

Hey guys, I'm adapting well to the game and becoming addicted to it although I haven't really played this deep an RPG before. I've playing it for about 5-6 hour stretches. Currently Lv10 with Boone + ED-E as companions and just got to the little place that has Veronica on my way to the strip for the 1st time.Just a few questions1) How do i do upgrades (a workbench?)2) Where do i find the (best?) traders that sell the upgrades?3) Can i have both Veronica &amp; Boone in my "team", as it doesn't give me an option?Also any tips for a Fallout newbie, I always seem to be learning in this game, so any hints would be helpful.Cheers guys :)
dy0x8	-20377	1288317291	fnv	Irrelevant data left in the game causing crashes? [ps3]	After playing the game in  3 x 6ish hour stretches, I have experienced 2 full game crashes where the game hangs on the loading screen when loading up a new area... However before the two crashes i experienced something a little strange.1st Crash - I was in Novac asking [No-Bark](/spoiler) some questions regarding the quest that [Boone](/spoiler) sends you on. One of [No-Barks](/spoiler) replies to me was in a completely different voice to his normal replies with full lip-snyc. Then when i loaded up my next room... **BANG** Loadhang :(2nd Crash - Camp Maccaron, As soon as i entered i done the [bounty hunter quests and then entered the building, used my excellent speech with Lt Boyd to help her interrogate the dude in the cell] then went off exploring a bit more, until i found Col Hsu and got the quest "I put a spell on you". As part of the quest i had to first speak with [Capt Curtis who then tells you to speak to Lt Boyd again... however she was nowhere to be found and i looked at my map marker and it showed i had to go to "Camp Forlorn Hope" right on the other side of the map? I thought this was strange so googled it and it seems she should be in her normal place... Anyway i went there and my marker pointed to this black dude with a mustache and a big carbine with a fancy pattern engraved (forgot his name?). I spoke to him and he continued the story for the quest i was on, but all in his own voice, telling me he saw people at a certain place/certain time etc... then pointer told me to go back to Maccaron, so i fast traveled, and it loadhung just as i tried to enter the base.](/spoiler)Turns out there might be some duplicate voice-overs by multiple people still on the disk and something is confusing my game to bug out like this. 2nd instance was a bit annoying as it cocked up the flow of the game for me. Lucky i save often so wont take me long to get back to where i was. **TL;DR** Crash 1 - Some dude i was talking to as part of a quest changed voice, game load-hanged when I went to a different room**TL;DR** Crash 2 - Quest told me to speak to someone, they weren't in their normal place, mapmarker told me to go halfway across the map when should have been in a local proximity, followed marker and random person who gave me the details to continue the quest, game load-hangs when entering a camps front door.**SAVE OFTEN AS YOU CAN!!!**

fulp1	-20377	1298931256	photography	First DSLR advise required: Amazon vs Ebay store	Hi all,So I have been researching DSLR's and finally settled on the Canon D500 from Amazon direct, due to the fact that my budget is £500 and it met my needs.However, the Canon 550D is approx the same price new. Only difference I can tell is that it is an Asian import (Kiss x4 branding).The seller has decent feedback, 4000positive vs 17 negative  in the past year and just short of 9k feedback. All items are shipped within the UK so no surprise VAT issues i can foresee. What are your guys opinions on it. Seems too good to be true, but what are the downsides of an Asian import? Edit - Advice was the word i was looking for in the title.Edit 2 - [reply email from seller.](http://i.imgur.com/FSdZt.jpg) - has uk compatible charger/1yr warranty.

h7ow5	-20377	1304982707	learnprogramming	Just had my 1st "Wow, im a programmer" moment!	Hi all,I am currently learning Objective C / Cocos2d as my first programming language which I am progressing slowly as many said its not the most forgiving language to start off with. Even with this in mind, I have chosen to do it, and currently enjoying myself. I followed a tutorial to create a sprite, make it move &amp; reset its position when it goes off of the screen. This worked perfect, however one redditors comment stood out to me from another /learnprogramming thread. Something like "dont copy, make up your own stuff"So with what i learnt in the tutorial, i made another coloured ball, made it move both vertically at a faster speed, and horizontal and keep it scrolling on the screen when it scrolls off. I didnt get it right the first few times, so i did a little minor debugging and when i got it working i felt like i really acomplished something.Here is a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvNoqvNUj_U) &amp; [source](http://pastie.org/1883066) of what i have done for those interested.

Ideally i would like a minimum of £1000 a month to cover bills etc but I have no idea what to expect.I know its not an easy question as it all depends on the game/popularity/reviews etc, but I would like to hear from other people who live off of being an indie developer and any pro tips.I am having fun making my game and thats the main thing, but like anyone I would like to quit my day job and get paid for what I enjoy. Edit: I do intend to make other games and maybe port to android as the SDK i'm using is quite flexible.

I have turned on the option to send diagnostic reports to Apple, so am I right in thinking it will automatically upload the crash reports?Also, if I find bugs/crashes/errors (that can be replicated) in applications, should I feed this back to the developers directly? **TL;DR In the iOS 5 beta - Should I report bugs found to Apple/Developers and what is the best way to do so?**

As with most public servers, we do get them and it frustrates me. I have zero tolerance for greifer's and have banned the user from my server, rolled back all his actions and protected your land so only you can build there.2) I guess I just want to give advice really. On my server rules wall, which is very short, I do sugest asking an admin to protect land if you want an area protected or contact an admin if you want damgage rolled back.3) Build a little further from spawn. The house you made is right next to spawn. I have pre-generated a 300 chunk radius around spawn, sadly no one has ventured very far, greifers seem to attack whatever is right outside spawn.  4) Can anyone suggest a better way of managing a SMP server? TL;DR - I'm sorry, griefer banned, his actions rolled back &amp; your land is protected.

mjnfc	-20377	1321842193	learnmath	A friend and I are stuck working out some math, little help?	Little background...My friend is making a computer game with a randomly generated characters and we are struggling to work out total number of characters there are. There are 4 pieces of art that make a character (head, body, arms, legs) &amp; 29 pieces of each head/body/arms/legs. The game randomly picks 4 pieces out of the 29 heads/bodys/arms/legs and makes a character. So, question is, How many total combinations of characters are there and what is the math behind it?29 head + 29 leg + 29 body + 29 arms = 116 bodyparts1 of each body part is picked.

mlsao	-20377	1321990149	applehelp	Macbook works fine on battery, power cuts when plugged in. 	To elaborate a bit, my macbook has been doing this for about a week and i thought it was related to the old battery.My old battery was dead (lasts about 15/20mins) so i have a new Apple battery. Both batterys boot up the Macbook fine, but if i plug in my power pack it just cuts the power anywhere between 10 seconds - 5 minutes.Any idea what would cause this? The power pack charges battery ok when laptop is powered down. I have the 13" MacBook Alu (2008) and the Magsafe power pack that it came with.Could it be that the Magsafe pack is defective and if so can it be replaced under my Apple Care?

nr4gl	-20377	1324904650	photography	A small cheap gadget I've used for my DSLR for 9 months, thought I would share. 	First things first, I have no affiliation with this company, I live in a completely different country, however I love the product.Its called [Zeh Bounce](http://zehbounce.com/zehbounce.html)It sits in front of your popup flash and bounces the light. Only really works in indoor settings where the flash can be bounced off of ceilings/walls but makes the pictures I take look so much better without the hassle of setting up a lighting rig. I use it 95% of the time (in light or dark settings) on indoor photosHere are two examples I just took today, only difference being that I didn't use the bounce on one of the pictures.

qc5n1	-20377	1330562567	MCpunchtrees	So 1.2 is coming out tomorrow - Here is the plan...	1.2 is coming and will cause a little havoc. It brings a new extended height limit, new mobs, new bricks and new ways to use old bricks. Read all about 1.2 changes [here](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Version_history/Development_versions#Minecraft_1.2_Snapshots)* **HOW WILL IT AFFECT US?**Right, as some of you may know punchtre.es (and most minecraft servers) run on a server client called [bukkit](http://bukkit.org). When Minecraft updates to a new version the team at bukkit rush to get a release out of their server. Bukkit allows us to put mods/plugins on the server for fun stuff and also to administrate you guys. **When 1.2 comes out there will be 2 servers you can play on:****IP: PUNCHTRE.ES** - The main server - This will have a new map and will be loaded with the standard minecraft server. THIS IS A TEMPORARY MAP UNTIL BUKKIT GETS FIXED AND WILL BE DELETED. This means no one can use any of the main commands (/spawn/home/tp/etc) and ranks will disappear until bukkit come out with a 1.2 server and the essential plugins work. **2nd Server:****IP: creative.punchtre.es:25665** - A special creative server - There have been many new lords join, so to reward you guys here is an 8 man creative server for ranks Lord &amp; above. You can still become a Lord by visiting http://punchtre.es and hitting the donate button on the side. Now, a little bad news (for you guys at least). On Sunday i am flying to China for a 2 week vacation and will be unable to perform any updates until i get back. If bukkit is not released by then, im afraid the server will be stuck on a standard server but I will try my best to get it all updated by the time i go, unfortunately, i have to rely on the bukkit team to make the server mod 1.2 compatible, and also the guys who make the various plugins/mod's to fix their plugins if there are any 1.2 bugs in them. * **When bukkit comes out, I will revert the map back to the current map and some/most things should work.** If you have any problems:* Post in this subreddit* PM me on reddit* Email: minecraft@punchtre.es* iMessage: minecraft@punchtre.es* Skype: craftydeano87* Msg me in game with /calladmin (sends a message to my phone)**TL;DR - 1.2 comes tomorrow - new map &amp; no rules until bukkit is fixed - new creative server for Lords &amp; above. I'm going on vacation.** EDIT1: Punchtre.es will have no rules while the temp map is loaded - anything allowed (except spamming text/hate talk). If you are worried about your house/chests being raided/greifed, build FAR FAR FAR AWAY from the initial spawn point.

Hey guys!I'm not sure how many people know this, as no parent I speak to IRL has known about this, however you can lockdown the hardware buttons so your kids cannot exit whatever app you put them in, and also lockdown all or part of the touchscreen. Go to Settings, general, accessibility and turn on guided access, and triple click the home button when in an app to lock it down. To unlock the app, triple click and enter a PIN number. Only works on iOS 6 and above. Perfect for my 15month daughter, as I set a movie to play and I know she cannot exit it and start messing around.

When power button is pressed (both with and without charger) nothing happens. Battery level indicator doesn't show anything either. After a little google, it seems either the charger or Macbook is faulty, so he has booked a Genius appointment for tomorrow.Just wanted to know if there is anything else that can be done before then?

1d0owk	-20377	1366821990	applehelp	Question about telephone support outside of the supported timeframe.	Im in the UK.My earpods have gone faulty on my iPhone 5. Basically when the earpods move, they act like the play/pause button is pressed. Maybe a loose cable inside. Tested in a couple devices, so defiantly earpod problem. I want to get them replaced but without going to the store, as it's a 3hr round trip I can do without. I am in warrantee so replacement isn't an issue, but I am apparently not allowed to phone apple to arrange a replacement as I'm outside the 90 day purchase.How flexible is this rule? There is an online self serve replacement option, but they lost every accessory except the earpods. Closest they have is the 'in ear' headphones (the £45ish ones) Any ideas?

No fast food, no processed food, no drink except water &amp; black coffee, 1200cal/day with strict logging (MFP), weighing food and weighing myself every morning. Along with light exercises and walking more every day. My carb/fat/protein mix is 38%/37%/25% on average for the past 6 days.So far I have lost 10lb (2-3lb a day). Are my scales broke? Is gravity being a little temperamental? I know it's not sustainable to loose like this, but can this be considered normal for someone who's just started? Is it water weight I'm loosing?

There is no sound as I was wearing headphones (kids are asleep!).Everything is on the default 'medium' setting (the lowest) apart from textures which are on 'high'. The game is running at 1400 x 900 on a Windows 7 Bootcamp partition from an external USB 3 HDD. I have not messed around with the graphics settings to see how much I can push the graphics while still having it perform well enough... yet.So far, It is running better than expected, looks good enough and performs well enough as you can see. For those of you who are on the fence about this game and have a similar spec Macbook, I hope the video is informative for you and sets your expectations. If there is anything you want to know, just ask - although I've only done the first couple missions so far.Also, sorry for the bad gameplay, I'm not used to playing with WASD and a trackpad while trying to keep the camera steady. Edit: Title should read 'How GTA 5 runs on Retina Macbook Pro', or something like that.Edit2: Updated video with different graphics settings and FRAPS. - http://youtu.be/PDE-w0tD8-0

I'm in a situation where this girl(16), whom we shall call "Mam" and I(17), who you can call "Sir" (just for the funnies), are just a great set of friends who see each other quite often, and go to restaurants, shopping, and more quite over-the-top places. We also talk a ton about ourselves and I feel our friendship is growing exponentially. We were friends for 1 year but like I said it was exponential, only these past 2 weeks have been intense. The question is what are the hints of a friend-zone friendship. I'd like to be with this girl, so tips are welcome too.P.S. Reasons why I think she and I are in the friend-zone is, even though we are getting close. She doesn't flirt or show feelings for me(other than a Facebook post that she put up as we were in Applebees about "I find everything he does cute &lt;3", which may or may not be about me). Yet she may not know how to, because shes absolutely gorgeous and the guys go to her. I, on the other hand, have flirted with her.TL;DR! How do I know if she wants to be in the friend-zone? How do I know if she likes me?
1oilrg	-20383	1381861136	leagueoflegends	Suggestion for Fixing the Limited Skins Issue	I'd like to say first off, this is not my original idea i would just like to post for vision.A redditor suggested that everyone who has a limited skin would get a summoner icon that would have a small cut-out of their skin's splash art. I personally love this idea, and did upvote the comment but doubt it was seen. I do not own any limited skin and would like to see some comments about what people who do, think about this idea. If Riot had already put in the work for the white border thingy on the splash art, then an additional work even if it was done very late, could go a long way, especially since this will undoubtedly get Riot a lot of money and annoy the hell out of the owners of old skins.
1pkfex	-20383	1383167757	RotMGideas	Any Plans from Kabam to Make an Official Trade Hub	I think Runescape had the right idea. Back when i was playing around 2007 they came out with the GE also known as the Grand Exchange. If Kabam never played RS before what you would do is post an item and then a price (a sample price scale would give you an idea of how much people are willing to pay for it) if your price and item matched with what people were willing to pay for it then the deal would be automatically made. Since there is no universal currency (officially) I think the same idea can be applied with trading items for items.

1pltxf	-20383	1383215649	RotMGideas	Necromancer Balancing Idea.	I believe necromancers are being completely overshadowed by wizards currently. With the release of pets having HP recovery is not really a big deal unless its sudden and clutch like on the priest. To be specific, skulls dont really need to be high tier because as a Necro you'd be able to heal more often with something like a tier 3 skull rather than a tier 5. What if skulls gave Wisdom? Would that be a good balance?

It would be exhilarating to need at least one sideways moving tech to avoid the magma-(sand)storm eradicating all life behind you.But what about civilization? I think civilization on planets where lava runs like IRL oceans is a little ridiculous anyway but feel free to suggest something.When does it end? After a specific amount of time it fades away, and only embers are left in the winds until they vanish with it.So I have to run all that time? Nah, just go underground if you don't feel like playing with it.Imagine Megaman except not passing through walls and more high def. Or Wall of Flesh from Terraria but much fatter and faster.**Edit:** Frequency can vary between different worlds, add some variety in the game's world generation.Comment Ideas Suggestions, Issues, and etc.

Are there any planned updates to make the mage more...well dazzling? The most I've seen anyone hit with a Fire Staff is 10 and the most I've seen arrows do is 22 so its strange since presumably the lack of aiming capabilities of the Fire Staff/Thunder Staff would be compensated with damage or at least fire-rate.

28mg7l	-20383	1403247305	smashbros	Story - Regarding whether or not Melee was fun for the casual gamer.	The setting is about 3 months after the release of melee, I was 8. I played the game constantly, trying to get trophies, completing the 1st player mode for every character, and other mindless grinding for no particular reason. Fast forward about 2 weeks and I had gotten into a certain extremely memorable point in the "Events" section. It was the match versus Dark Link. Since the beginning of melee I had played against all kinds of lvl 9s creating various challenges for myself, but never had I seen a character whoop my ass so bad. My friends weren't as good as this guy, and there was nothing else in the game I can set to his level. To make things worse, I mained Link. It took a solid week of constantly trying to beat him over and over again, countless attempts of high difficulty story mode, and level 9 challenges to finally beat him. Thinking back on it now, he probably wasn't all that hard, but to an 8 year old its not exactly a walk in the park. When I did, it was one of the best feelings I had in my entire 8 years of living. Looking back on the long grind to become better than Dark Link, I still enjoyed myself. Not only did I learn about what did good damage, what can execute really nicely, and all of these small things Dark Link did that I couldn't even fathom before facing him, but I also felt thrilled that there was something stronger than me that I can look forward to beating. Now we are at the present, my gamecube is long gone, and I had my Wii sent to my nephews after a pretty solid 8 years of owning the thing. I watched the Melee documentary and I learn there was SO MUCH MORE to be accomplished. UNBELIEVABLE that there was so much potential to be reached. Melee is now so much more than I could've dreamed it to be. NO. It was how I always dreamed it to be, as a kid, thinking that I could be something incredible if I practiced enough and learned from others better than me. Beating 3 other lvl 9s with 5 stocks each (including myself) in a team match of 3v1 is probably nothing to the people I now watch in awe such as Mango, M2K, and the others. Although that goal felt near impossible back then its fascinating to think that was only the beginning for these people. I own a 3ds and I plan to buy a WiiU with the release of Smash4 in hopes of one day becoming amazing at a franchise I've always loved. I am the casual smash player and It would be a dream to see Smash 4 become ceiling-less. A dream to be good at what your passionate for. A dream that you can 4 stock Mango and M2k if you are really really good at what you do. And like that grind I had as a kid I believe it would be just as fun on the way there.TLDR; \&gt; Be op  \&gt; be 8 y. old  \&gt; play melee 3 months after release  \&gt; Play Event match 18 : Link's Adventure  \&gt; Get ass handed to you.  \&gt; *Queue* 80's training montage   \&gt; Finally beat Dark link  \&gt; OMGbestfeelingever.jpg  courtesy of /u/henryuuk

2joaa8	-20383	1413701473	smashbros	Can someone offer any advice on how to get out of tech chases?	So I just went against this Jigglypuff for about 15 games, playing the few characters I main: Shulk, Gdorf, C.Falcon and a few other misc. chars but no matter what I picked or what I did when I mixed it up Jiggly's jump fair jump fair jump fair jump fair combo kept knocking me extremely far off the stage, it could even start off with something so simple as a grab. Same was done with Ness after the 15 games, I tried counters and its hilarious how the counter actually made me have enough landing lag that I got rested on, I tried air dodges but Jiggs is just too fast and can miss and capitalize on the lag even afterwards, I tried Vectoring but the hitbox actually stays for a long enough time combined with her floatiness that sometimes I would get hit anyway other times just get bair-ed after dodging the fair, and sometimes Id try recovering high but that didnt work at all. Maybe theres something I missed, a character with tools to deal with stuff like this, or maybe some characters are just destined to die in the air (other than LM) so I'm asking you, the reddit community, can you offer your insight? Thanks.P.s. Fuck you "matt"
2lxj0p	-20383	1415677550	CrazyHand	[SSB4] What can I do to fix the rubber on the circlepad removing itself?	It does it whenever I input a direction, the opposite direction, then lift my finger. On a barely related note, I'm sad because it always rotated since I bought it used, but until I played something as input intensive as SSB4 I hadn't removed it.
2mdeyd	-20383	1416050384	CrazyHand	How do you turn in mid-air.	I have this terrible tendency to attempt an off ledge play with my double jump and then fail to get back on stage with up-b this is common with rosalina, ganon, and most characters with a up-side recovery.
2mhig7	-20383	1416164952	CrazyHand	Can someone suggest me a character to sub for fighting against projectile heavy characters?	I main Ganon, occasionally use C.Falcon. and I used to main Shulk. My favorite traits in a character is hurting people a lot with very little, combos aren't really my thing. I don't mind projectiles in the kit, but I'd like it if s/he would suffice without it, as in every matchup without projectiles I do not prefer to use them.Currently I use Yoshi for projectile heavy characters, but I feel like there could be a better choice.

2pllxj	-20383	1418841655	CrazyHand	What do I do when I shield an opponent's attack but I get pushed so far back I can't shield-grab?	Title. Sometimes I feel like when I run up to grab them after their attack is done its already such a long period of time that they can attack me again. I see opponents have no trouble with this (especially since I'm a Ganon main) so there must be something I'm not doing.
2pyqr4	-20383	1419157851	CrazyHand	How to practice grabbing?	I now realise grabbing is so much more huge than I thought it was. To the point where I am good enough that it cant be ignored but bad enough that my skill is too limited without it. I realise this, but I have no idea how to implement it into my playstyle. Does anyone have any tips? How did you learn how to grab consistently?

I don't record my gameplay so I don't have any footage, but I couldn't move out of the base no matter where I clicked. Restarting the game did the trick however that doesn't make it any less of an issue.
2uz9ln	-20383	1423226572	leagueoflegends	Regarding the struggle for Veigar and Morde changes. I propose...	**Veigar:** * Higher base mana regen* Shorter Q base damage with higher scaling, * Lower Q CDTo achieve the playstyle of Veigar that he was meant to have. The higher base mana regen will help with his powerspike with chalice all the meanwhile helping him in lane pre-Chalice with his passive. The Lower Q CD and lower base damage with higher scaling will help achieve ideal Q farming stats without having his lane bullying and supporting.The higher scaling on his Q will fill the void that DFG has left behind, and give him his power spike at an appropriate time. An alternative would to make his Q scaling scale with level rather than a flat amount.Along with these changes, support Veigar will likely die however it will bring more flexibility in balancing mid lane Veigar so he may one day see high elo or competitive play without fear of him taking bot lane by storm.**Mordekaiser:*** I'm clueless, the premise Morde is built around can make any change in the game turn him borderline broken, so having him actually get a buff might make him overpowered in case anything else happens.If any good comment shows up with an idea on what to do for morde, I'll add it here.

I know I'm a little late to the party and most of this may be common knowledge by now but the uploading took forever D:(Note: I am on PC but I am not able to run at a full 60 fps. This may be a factor) Using the ways I've described in the video I managed to chain enough boosts together to keep up a high speed for over a minute. By optimizing the timing of the release this can be done in something like 8 seven second boosts instead of 15 4 second boosts.If you'd rather not sit through the awful quality or want a recap here's a summary: The distance of your boost is reliant on when you release the binocular's zoom. Too early or too late and you get maybe a 3-4 second boost, but by releasing at the optimal time you can boost anywhere from 6-10 seconds at full speed. I time my release using two factors: When the last of the roll audio clip ends, or just when the yellow in the stamina bar disappears ( I find this much harder to time but may be more accurate)Finally all credit for the discovery of this glitch (that I know of) goes to Steel369. Links to his twitch channel, youtube channel and original video are in the description.EDIT: Thanks for the input everyone. More things may have been discovered so I'll need to catch up. If there's anything major I'll add it to this post. Also if I make another video I will improve the quality but I gave up youtube a couple years ago so my recording stuff is all sitting in a box somewhere.

1bjlo8	-20391	1364939406	assassinscreed	What do you think of this for a side game?	What would you guys think if they were to do a side game some point in the future similar to Smash Bros. or even Mortal Kombat/ Street Fighter/ Soul Calibur? It's getting to where they have enough assassin's and supporting characters that they could do it, and I think it would be an awesome addition. They could have some of the Villains in it too, with maps from all the games. Who would down for it?Edit: Here's what I came up with, but the AC universe is so huge that plenty more could be added. Some might not work, some stuff might be awesome. I think it would be cool anyway.Assassin’s Creed Fighting GameA fighting game, like Soul Calibur or Mortal Kombat, but with the characters, maps, and elements of the AC universe mixed into it; similar to what Dragonball Z Budokai was like.Characters:There are already a plethora of main characters in the AC universe that could be used in the game, and it gives an opportunity to see more of characters that never really got the time they deserved in the games or were never put into games to begin with (Shao Jun or Orelov, Aveline), or who we never got to see in their prime (like Achilles or Giovanni).  And lets the player control characters that they got to interact with in games, but never play as.  It would also give the possibility to be a Templar, which other than the brief Haytham segment hasn’t really been featured in AC. It could also be expanded to include different types of guards from the various games, and characters from the Multiplayers as well. Some of the Boss characters could tie into the modern time arc, like having Juno or Minerva be one of the bosses.It also allows for new looks for many of the characters that only have one look throughout all the games, giving them their in game look as well as an alternate or two. This also gives players a chance for something that has been in demand recently with letting them create their own custom character. Letting them choose from different facial options as well as hair, clothes, and armor, with different weapon choices.Maps:There are plenty of different locations that have been seen throughout the AC games that could be used in arena type combat. Some could have ring outs while not allowing for it in others giving a variety of different play options. Perhaps some maps could be multi-leveled; like instead of ring outing, when a character gets pushed off a roof, they could fall onto a lower roof, causing damage but not immediate defeat. You could then either have both levels available for combat like in Super Smash Bros. or have the other character jump down to the other level.Story:The story mode could be something like this; The Assassins have defeated Juno and are using the info gathered from the fight to build a virtual program of her. Coupled with the memory data from Desmond, they have compiled virtual doppelgangers to the characters experienced in the Animus. They have begun to use this technique to train new assassins rather than reliving experiences because of problems with the bleeding effect. Each of the characters in the program would have their own story mode that shows their story (like in Soul Calibur).  Other modes could be an Arcade mode where you have to fight progressively harder computers, a co-op mode where you have to fight with a friend, a versus mode where you battle a friend (and co-op for up to 4 player).Character List:-Altair-Ezio-Connor-Aveline-Orelov-Desmond-Daniel Cross-Al Mualim-Claudia-Cesare Borgia-Rodrigo Borgia-Younger Achilles-Giovanni Auditore-Shao Jun-Haytham Kenway-Edward Kenway-Blackbeard-Yusuf (ACR)-Uncle Mario-Bartolommeo-Machiavelli-La Volpe-Connor’s Indian Friend (Don’t remember his name)-Juno-Jupiter-Minerva-Assassin Recruits-Guards-Multiplayer Characters-Custom CharacterMaps:-On boat (Aquila or Edward’s)-Bridge into Il Vaticano-Assassin Lair (Constantinople)-Monteriggioni-Homestead-Assassin Headquarters (Rome)-Masyaf-Animus loading area-Frontier area-Da Vinci’s Workshop-Achilles’ Assassin Room-The cave from beginning of AC1-Rooftops (could have multiple with feature from above with multiple areas)-Muliplayer maps-Abstergo

1boy8w	-20391	1365114466	cosplayers	What characters are you sick of seeing?	We've all seen them, and are fully aware that some characters are WAY overdone. So lets hear it /r/cosplayers, what are your top 5 overdone cosplays for each gender.Also, just note, this isn't a hate post and everyone has their own opinions on this i'm sure. If you do or want to do or have done anything on here, who cares. If you want to do it, then do it, as long as it is fun and you enjoy it. Nobody will look down on you for doing something that you enjoy (i would hope).So here is mine list:For Females (in no particular order):-Harley Quinn. I have nothing against the character, and I can see why a lot of people would have fun with cosplaying her. But still, i feel like every 4th post of so is about Harley Quinn. -Catwoman. I'm starting to see less catwomen costumes around, but there are still plenty of them around. Same with Harley, I blame the huge influx of Batman movies and games the past few years. Don't get me wrong, i like Batman as much as the next guy, but admit it- the amount of Batman stuff around not only in cosplay, but even more so in stores is getting ridiculous.-Black Widow. Similar to with the other two. Ever since the Avenger's came out, it seems like everyone wants to be Black Widow. I'll admit i never actually saw it, so maybe she's just an insanely awesome character, but I don't get the fascination.-Mad Moxxi. I played Bordelands one, but I'll admit i haven't gotten around to playing 2 yet. But, if 2 is anything like the first game, i'm guessing Moxxi isn't actually in the game all that much. From what i can tell she isn't one of the playable characters, which makes me think from the first game that she really didn't do much.  But it seems like there have been a ton of Moxxi cosplays being posted the last few months. -Misty. I loved pokemon as a kid, but Misty never really grabbed me as that great a character. I'm a guy though, so take it for what its worth, a little boy won't associate nearly as much as a girl would. But i've seen a bunch of Misty cosplays recently too. Partially because its an easy one to do as a couple, or quick to throw together if needed, but whatever the reasons it just never does much for me.(Others that could easily be on my list; Phoenix, Rogue, Power Girl, Elizabeth, Lara Croft, Any Superheroes "girl companion", Slave Leia)Males:-Ironman. I'll admit, this is more from being on the RPF than from cons and cosplay stuff. It just seems like everyone on there is doing Ironman. It has quickly become the new Master Chief.-Batman. Same complaints as with the female super hero characters. its just everywhere.-Spiderman. See batman. Geez, i really don't like superheroes... though i'll admit, Spidey always was my favorite so i can't help but not as mind as much when i see it.-Link. I love the Zelda games, always have. But I feel like i would never want to do a Link costume at this point just from how many i've seen. I just feel like its a been there done that thing.-Doctor Who. I'm a huge Doctor Who fan. And i'll admit that i have a blue tennant esque suit i wear with a brown trench coat some days. But i feel like i've seen a bunch of Doctor who cosplays around. Maybe because its fairly simple, or maybe just because the Doctor is a character that is widely loved.(others that could be on the list: Master Chief, Ash Ketchum, The Joker, Mario (not as much recently), Darth Vader, Boba Fett)I'll also admit I'm not all that into anime, so a lot of those go right over my head when its the same character. I'm much more into gaming and tv/ movie stuff. There's mine, so what do you guys think?
1cl5m8	-20391	1366260192	cosplay	[Help] Ezio Belt AC2	So I'm putting together an AC2 costume, and i recently got the belt buckle in that i am going to use. Does anyone have any advice on how to connect the belting to the buckle? It is just flat resin/ plastic on the back of it and i'll be using leather belting for the actual belt parts. Is there some sort of really strong glue i could use or will i have to drill holes into the back to put the belts on? I had planned on doing that but i would be worried about going too far accidentally. What would you guys recommend? I also though about putting a sheet of sintra behind it to provide some more stability, but i would have to use screws for that...

1yios3	-20391	1392967129	Jaguars	What to do with the cap space?	With the recent announcement that cap is expected to be raised to 130 million, the Jaguars will have roughly 54 million dollars in cap space. So what do we do with what we have? It has to be spent in the next 3 years iirc, so if the jags want to sign players to 2-3 year contracts, now would seem like the time to do it. So who do you think the FO will go after? Who do you want them to go after?Here's my list of hopefuls:-Greg Hardy- DE- Current Salary 1.3 MillionComing off his rookie contract after making a name for himself, the Panthers have some cap issues they're looking at and he will likely want more than they will pay him.-Michael Bennett- DE- Current Salary: 4.8 MillionAfter a one year deal under the Seahawks, his situation is similar to Hardy's. Seattle will be looking at a lot of cap space issues this off season and may end up being too costly. Either player will give the Jaguars a great pass rushing DE, freeing them up to look at other positions in the draft.-Alex Mack- C- Current Salary 5 MillionAfter the retirement of Brad Meester the Jaguars will be looking to find another long term Center. Mack is one of the best in the league, but is much less likely to fall to free agency compared to Bennett and Hardy as the Browns have the third most cap space available going into 2014. Still, they may figure Mack's asking price is more than they are willing to pay and let him walk, and with him under center the Jag's shaky interior line becomes that much better.-Brian Orakpo- OLB- Current Salary: 5.1 MillionThe raise in cap space severly reduces the likelihood of the Redskins letting Orakpo walk. But, the management at the Redskins has raised a few question marks over the last year or so, and they may decide not to resign him. If he does hit FA, Orakpo would be a good compliment to Pozlusny and help elevate the otherwise sad state of the LB talent. Couple him and Poz with either (or both) of the DE listed above, as well as the young developing secondary the Jaguars have and suddenly the defense in Jacksonville is looking fierce for the first time in years.These are four guys who could make immediate impacts in areas that we desperately need help at. Sign them each at 7 million or so and that still leaves around 25 million in cap space for the year while establishing a strong defense which we can build around and add depth to over the next few years. This leaves us free to adress oline, RB, and QB in the draft as well as build depth in all positions with later picks.So theres my wish list, whats yours?

Especially since my GF was planning on going as the 10th Meta-crisis, so i would worry neither of ours would be recognized, same with if i did 11. What are your opinions?
22344d	-20391	1396510080	malefashionadvice	Anybody have experience with Danier?	I've been looking for a nice leather moto/ bomber style jacket for a while and i love some of the Danier ones that i've seen. I found one on eBay that i really like in a size small and was curious if anyone has purchased from them before? I normally wear a size small, but i bought a US Polo jacket that is similar in style to this one and the fit was way off, so i'm worried this one may be too big as well. the layed flat measurements look a bit large as well, but i'm not much of an expert when it comes to guessing sizes based on measurements. my measurements are;-37 chest-31 waist-23-ish sleeve (i have short arms)-15.5 shouldersthe listing says the garments measurements are-21 inch pit to pit-18.5 shoulders-24 sleevethis seems a bit large to me, but i'm not sure if its just extra fabric needed for movement etc, especially since the tag lists it as a 36-38 size. Anybody able to help me know if this will fit before i buy? Or anyone with person experience with them if their sizes are accurate or run large?http://www.ebay.com/itm/141241522625?_trksid=p2055119.m1438.l2649&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AITthanks!

265vp6	-20391	1400714674	gaming	/r/gaming, recommend me a game?	So i've gotten through, or gotten sick of, all the games i own and am looking for recommendations. i'm not a big gamer, so i don't know many titles beyond the big releases. looking for a new game for ps3 to play. i love the assassin's creed series, so something along that line would be good. i'd like something that is a bit more based in reality though. the parkour dynamics don't really need to be there for me, so i'd say i'm looking for something with a good stealth dynamic, and realistic combat. something where i can't hide in grass that only comes up to my waist, and i can't take out a million enemies at once, since those are my biggest complaints about the series. i also mainly play games for the stories when i do play, so rpg's like diablo aren't really my thing, though i did love the mass effect games too. other than those games i liked;the kotor series (i played on pc, but my laptop cant handle modern games), the force unleashed games, devil may cry (old series), tomb raider underworld, the borderlands games, starfox adventure, the zelda games. that's most of what i've played, my collection isn't too huge.so /r/gaming, what would you recommend for me?

Gordon is more likely to play at this point i'd say, but there is still a possibility of Blackmon being reinstated. How far do you see Gordon falling, and are the risks on either of them too large to be gambled on?
27niau	-20391	1402268918	fantasyfootball	Colston, or Cameron?	Doing one of the fantasy team advice forum reddit leagues. 14 team league, trying to decide who to take for my 4th round pick. so far i have Marshawn Lynch, Reggie Bush, and Alshon Jeffery. I'm leaning toward either Cameron or Colston. Cameron could have a big year with Gordon missing time, but worries me about the poor QB situation and that he didn't really put up big numbers past the first few games last season. Colston seems like a much more stable pick, won't put up huge numbers but seems dependable for around 1000 yards. it's a 3 wr league too, so i'm not sure if going for a higher TE will be worth it here.open to others as wellhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xYOxbSMIO8zB3u-KPCdy8QnVnO9eUUkCAPtsX1vBEdc/edit?pli=1#gid=0here's the doc link with all the players that have been taken so far. what do you guys think? or should i go with someone i haven't mentioned?
2836zp	-20391	1402697804	fantasyfootball	How early is too early to take a top D?	In one of the fantasy team advice forum reddit leagues, so with 14 teams i feel like grabbing a D/ST earlier rather than later is a good idea. this way i won't have to try and grab a good match up week in and week out of the waiver wire and struggle with the bottom half of the leagues D's being all that is available. we're going into round 7, i have pick number 6, all D's still on the board. i'm considering taking one of the top D's, what do you guys think? i have 3 RB, 2 WR, and a TE. if i don't go for a D i'll likely finish out my WR's (3 wr, no flex league), only 2 other teams don't have a QB yet so my options are going to be about the same in later rounds for QB. with WR being so deep i feel like taking a defense might be the best option, but a few of my friends who do fantasy keep pushing the take a d/st late view. what do you guys think, too early or is it a good move?
28hfdw	-20391	1403118088	fantasyfootball	What are your thoughts on Doug Baldwin?	He was barely behind Tate in stats last year, but i've been hearing almost nothing about him. And with Tate gone he has moved into WR1 on the right, meaning he'll only be competing with Harvin for targets, who has played a full season once in his entire career. I feel like he has a huge upside this year but for some reason is under most people's radar.Trying to decide between him and Anquan Boldin at wr3 in one of the fantasy advice forum leagues. I feel like Baldwin has more upside with an increased role and less around him, but is in a run heavy offense. Boldin will see a decreased role with crabtree and has been in the league 10 years now, which could hurt his production. who do you guys favor between the two?

2l7mkt	-20391	1415060592	gaming	Can anybody help me with Xbox 1 day one issues?	So after years of never having an issue with PS systems, my gf decided we should buy an Xbox one instead of a PS4 like i wanted. We got it in the mail today and it already doesn't work. It is stuck on the day one update, i've run it 5 times now and every single time it get stuck at 74 percent and then refuses to do anything. i cannot get to the settings to do a factory reset because it won't give me access to the settings menu at all. Literally all i can do is turn it on, hit update or turn off system, try to update until it gets stuck, repeat. i've looked online and apparently even though this has been an issue since launch of the console, nobody at microsoft has bothered to fix it or find an easy way to get around the issue. i looked through the microsoft forums and couldn't find any real way to fix the problem. their only method of customer service also has about an hour and a half wait time so that is fucking useless. has anybody had this issue and found a way to get it to function? pretty pissed right now that i spent 400 bucks on a console that can't actually do anything*For anyone else looking for a fix, we got around it by downloading the updates onto a flash drive and then porting it over from that. Took about 4 hours to download the update that way but it did it.*

Never built a PC before (been using a pretty powerful laptop all throughout college so far) ... help me change that!First and foremost, I'm willing to spend up to $1000, and I don't think I'll get enough power for under $600, but take a look at my aspirations and let me know what kinda price point I'll be looking at. I'm being flexible here. **Here's a quick rundown of what I want to do with it:*** Gaming - I do a good deal of gaming, but I'm not hell bent on playing on max graphic settings. I play Steam games, Starcraft and SC2, and emulators (I wouldn't mind getting a GPU that can run Wii emulators. Also lemme know if we aren't allowed to talk about this, this is my first foray into reddit and I know a lot of forums frown upon talking about emulation)* Programming - I'll be doing a lot of web development, Arduino projects, and then some C#, Python, and Java here and there.* Music Production - I mess around on Ableton Live pretty frequently. If you have a lot of midi notes in your song or are using a shitton of plugins, it starts to hit the processor pretty hard. * General usage - Browsing (Firefox is a big system hog for me), watching 1080p HD video, music listening, etc. **Parts: (what I have in mind)*** CPU - I honestly think an Intel i3 would do the trick. If there's room in the budget I'll spring for an i5.* RAM - 8GB* HDD - two 500GB drives* SSD - 64GB, 128GB if budget permits. * mobo - Ideally 6+ USB ports - 2 or 3 of USB 3.0 and then 3-4 USB 2.0. At least two 6gbits/s SATA ports. An ethernet out port. Wi-Fi compatibility. And then whatever else you guys see fit. * case - just looking for something low key, ideally mid tower size, that can handle all this (especially the USB port requirements I want).* graphics card - I want to be able to watch 1080p video, support up to 3 monitors, and keep up with the gaming requirements I outlined above. * power supply - no idea* CD/DVD drive - I have picked out right now (this will depend on budget, blu ray if I'm underbudget or just a regular CD/DVD drive if I'm cutting my budget tight). * keyboard and mouse - already have them.* Monitor - I'm currently using a 19" TV as a second monitor on my laptop. BUT for this build, I ideally want to be running 3 monitors at once eventually. Might not buy the monitors right when I buy all the parts, as the TV will do fine in the meantime (it has HDMI and VGA in). Looking for suggestions of monitors that can rotate (great for programming and surfan the web!) and ideally at least one 19" (maybe two) and 1 (or none if I go with two 19s) 24" monitor if I can get one on sale. So I guess I'll need a GPU that can support 3 outputs?* OS - Windows 7, dual booting Arch Linux either partitioned from the SDD ideally or an HDD if there's no enough space in the SDD.* anything I'm forgetting? :DAnd lastly I'm from the USA and I ideally Newegg, Amazon, and Microcenter (there is one about 30 mins from me). THANKS IN ADVANCE. I know these are a lot of specs, but I've never done this before and I just wanna be thorough.

I think it's from pushing...so here's some background info:I'm regular footed. I push way better with my left foot (mongo) than with my right foot. I try to push regular because it's "proper form" (and TBH I tend to go faster pushing regular). But when I push regular, I experience that pain in my ankle/lower shin area... Doesn't happen when I push mongo. Depending on how long I board for, the pain will typically last until I go to bed and then subside by morning. Either way, I don't want to be hurting myself with bad form, if that's the case. Have any of you experience pain in that area of your leg, and if so, how do you prevent it?*[here](http://imgur.com/dH0vy8y) is a picture of my leg for reference points on where it hurts.

Who can I contact about this?**EDIT: I found [this link](http://offcampus.osu.edu/off-campus-living/trash-collection/recycling/). Should be useful. But seriously, has anyone else had their bins stolen? I don't get it. Why would anyone steal these bins?

I am a third year Comp Engineering student and I don't know how I've made it this far without failing out. I don't have any willpower and this is what sets me back the most. I can't stop myself from smoking, buying weed, fapping, or anything else that distracts me from my main goal. I don't even feel like I've truly been myself for years. It's my first day and I want it to be my last first day. All of my housemates smoke. All of my friends smoke. I can't escape the idea of it and I don't want to loose my friends. I've told them that I was quitting months ago when school started and they were supportive but I relapsed within days. Every day feels like a constant struggle of catching up with school work and not smoking. I don't even know what to do anymore. Currently cramming for a midterm tomorrow for a class that I haven't been to in weeks because of the nagging desire to smoke. I'm lost. 
2md5o0	-20404	1416039004	leaves	It's been 3 days and I feel lower than I've even been in my life	I have been feeling so depressed. I feel like I could erupt into tears at any moment. I've been feeling so suicidal because of all the shit that has been piling on and all the realizations to all the time I've wasted smoking pot, fapping, and doing all the other fucking bullshit. I just turned in an assignment that I had two weeks to do but I wasn't able to complete in time and it was shit shoddy job that'll probably get less than half for. I want to go to counseling services on campus but I'm just afraid to talk to someone. I can't even tell my professors because why the fuck would they care about a shit student who scores far below the average and does terrible on all the labs. 
2mhmfl	-20404	1416167204	leaves	I went out last night	Today begins my fifth day of being clean from MJ. I was feeling like death on Friday and terrible thoughts were entering my head. I was set on it being like this for the rest of my recovery time until I felt like myself again. I thought drinking would have a negative effect on me but it was actually pretty uplifting. The only bizarre thing that happened was I started tearing up at one point for no reason. The people around me at the party didn't think anything of it. Thankfully my friend who I have been sharing all my thoughts and feelings with was there and I was able to tell her and she comforted me for a little bit. I started telling a few more of my closer friends last night that I had begun the process of fully quitting once again and they were very supportive. Usually on a weekend night everyone in the friend group returns to one person's house and a huge smoking sesh goes on for hours at a time. This time when we went back the bongs were not even brought out. I don't want my personal issues to limit my friends who do choose to smoke and I also don't want to not be able to go to their houses because of the urges that arise. Not sure what to do here. I really despise the idea of finding non smoking friends because I have grown so close to these people over the past few years.
2mr1wm	-20404	1416380867	leaves	For anyone that is attempting Day One	Today marks my first week of being marijuana free, and the community members who told me that the first week was going to be the hardest were damn right. On my third day, I felt lower than I had ever been in my entire life. Thoughts of depression and suicide seeped through and I'm honestly so happy that I didn't have the courage to attempt anything. I went to counseling on my campus yesterday to deal with these thoughts, and it was incredibly helpful to speak to an actual professional who deals with these issues on a regular basis. The physician I spoke with has already set up an appointment with a dietitian on how to eat properly since I have been eating absolute shit junk food for the past month. It was super difficult for me to even open the door to counseling and even tell someone my every thought. I initially started sharing my thoughts in this subreddit and I'm really glad that this community lead me in the right direction and that I had a place to vent even if only one or two redditors happened to read it.Motivation was and is still a little difficult, but after reading all of the success stories on my former posts and on posts from today, I know what I want in life and I know that sitting and doing nothing will not benefit me in any way. It's weird slowly starting to tell my friends that I have quit this habit, but the ones closest to me have already accepted it and give me their full support. So yes, the first week IS the hardest thing you will ever do, but realize that you are in a position to change everything for the better. I know my credibility isn't as high as those who have gone months and years, but I just wanted to share that it is possible to start. Don't keep anything bottled in. Your friends and this community are here for you. This is the one reason why I have failed time and time again in the past. Quitting weed has also domino'd into me finally beginning to quit fapping and pornography for more than two days. I always keep myself busy and never let a fleeting thought pass.   PS: Drink 8 glasses of water a day. Always have a water bottle near you.

I can study better, retain more information from class, and have done 10x the amount of work than I have in the past two years. However I still have not been able to quit NoFap. My brain can't tell the difference so am I really changing anything by not smoking? Also I wake up almost every morning with the same feeling as a "highover." I haven't been able to hit the gym because of a constant catching up that I have to do because of starting off the year pretty shit.
2p94aa	-20404	1418554370	leaves	Day 32	Sleep has been getting slightly better in the last four days since I previously posted. It's finals week for me right now and usually at this time I would be carelessly playing video games at home, smoking it up, and not doing what I should. I have been waking up the earliest I have ever seen myself in these past few days and it is incredible how much I am able to complete and be able to retrieve almost all of the information that I have retained by going to class nearly everyday for the past 32 days. It's a great feeling to look back on notes and not be completely lost by them. Unfortunately I wish I had had the mindset I do now at the beginning of the school year because as a CompEng the second I am behind in schoolwork is the second I have to start playing catchup. I remember two or three weeks into the year I spent an entire week doing nothing except cutting class, and rushing home to hit a bowl. I ended up doing absolutely nothing and I appalled at my behavior. I am incredibly excited for the opportunities the future holds for me. I am already planning on learning Ruby on Rails and hopefully heading towards coding my own mobile platformer. A lack of MJ has shown me that the only thing making me lazy is myself. Best of luck to everyone in this community. 
2pjzg6	-20404	1418798604	leaves	The fear of losing friends	At midnight today I will have completed 35 days free from marijuana. I just wanted to ask the community about naturally losing touch with "smoker" friends. I had read a multitude of posts in the past several weeks and I was afraid that this was naturally going to happen to me as the weeks progressed but I am still very much in contact with them and they are honestly more supportive that my non-smoker friends which is rather bizarre to me. They never prompt me to smoke and I honestly love that about them. I hope any one reading this and struggling are surrounded by people that will support you in your best interests regardless of the decisions you make. 
2qz9b9	-20404	1420082705	leaves	50 DAYS TODAY	I could not be happier today. I stopped smoking about halfway through November and have continued to not smoke. The first few weeks were hell on Earth with onset depression and suicidal thoughts but I seeked help from counsellors, friends, and this amazing subreddit. My grades didn't turn out to be as good as they could have been even though I quit halfway through the first term of this year. Yet I am excited to get back to school and actually be a full time student who appropriately balances schoolwork, a job, sleep, and exercise. I hope everyone out there reading this is doing their best to make it through this sludge of quitting. You've probably read countless posts like I have and hopefully have realized by now that yes life will get better. Also currently on Day 4 of NoFap which is insanely tough as well but I'm keep that mentality of "Yes I can" and trekking through this. Happy New Year!! Make 2015 count!!
2wuri8	-20404	1424680606	leaves	Day 103	I was you at one point. I was browsing the Internet for help. I realized that MJ and me would not work. Yeah maybe some people are fully functioning stoners but that will never be me. I stumbled on r/leaves and it was the best thing that happened to me. This community told me and showed me through their posts that yes quitting was possible. I haven't been on this page in nearly 50 days now because I try to stay busy and not think about being MJ free. Working on fixing my life was not an overnight thing. The motion and idea was however. I was sitting at my desk in my bedroom working on a project that was due that night in two hours. I was so stumped and frustrated because I never went to class. Or even if I did I was high as a kite. I was so disappointed in myself. My grades were dwindling. I wasn't living up to my potential. I realized that night after being so angered with this project that I would have to make a big change starting right now. There was no last bowl, no last hit. I grabbed everything weed related I owed, put it in a bag and threw it all away. I continued the next day by speaking about my problems to my boss who was a recovering alcoholic of 30 something years. I spoke to a drug counselor. If you seek help there are people out there who will assist you. Who will show an inkling that yes they care. And here I am 103 days later and it feels great. Yea I still have some other vices that I'm working on, trying not to drink every weekend and abstain from fapping but I've noticed the changes. Uni is still a bitch and is kicking my ass but i have the motivation and will to power through it. In the time that I've been MJ free I've started hitting the gym up on a 5-6 day a week basis. I'm almost always in the labs working on homework, projects, and extracurricular activities. I try to keep as busy as possible so I don't have a chance to ever think about it. I've even noticed my social skills immensely increase. A girl even told me I was cute a few weeks ago at a party I was at. I couldn't even believe that shit. I make direct eye contact when speaking, I articulate my words. No more stumbling when trying to express an idea. No more feeling awkward in a room where I don't know anyone at all. But honestly at this point I don't think about it at all really. Yes my friends smoke. Just about every single one smokes. But they don't care. They respected my decision and I am forever grateful for having these people in my life. I hope that you too are surrounded by supportive people. If you have to lose that friend that always prompts or urges you and won't respect you or help you out...so be it. It's your life. And are they really that a great a friend at that point?Something that helped me every day was going back to my first post in this sub. I'm a computer engineer at my school and surprisingly a lot of other former stoner engineers commented on my post telling me how they were once me but today they make six figures and are at the top of their field. That's really what made me realize that fuck yeah I can do it too. No one is born knowing everything they just have the willpower and desire to learn. That's what I am going for right now.  Best wishes and the best of luck to you. Seize the day.

I'm currently 124 days clean from weed and today marks the start of my 4th day free of PMO. I had recently hit a week for the first time in nearly 300 days and I am back again trying harder than ever. Something that helped me with smoking and will now help me with fapping is that I never want to be back at the 0th day. I wrote down how I felt after my most recent relapse and how the past few days have been versus when I was on Day 7 and I really don't want to be at that place again. I want to see how I will be after 90...180 days etc.Also thanks for all the great posts recently. They've really been helpful when the urges have been the most. 
38202d	-20404	1433143860	leaves	201 DAYS	I actually forgot to post on the 200th day yesterday. I rarely think about smoking. The only real day I had urges was 4/20 but that feeling passed pretty quickly. I think it was just the allure of that date that brought some urges back, it was rather strange. But wow what a journey. I can't believe I've made it this far but it's been awesome. Focusing all that time and energy into other areas of my life...school, extracurriculars. It's fucking fantastic to be able to think quickly and clearly. Knowing where to put my priorities. I'm an engineering student at my uni and I notice the subtle edge that I have over my other friends when we're learning a new topic...I love it. Some of my friends, the ones that I started smoking with, always ask me when/if I'm gonna go back ever. I don't think I ever could because when I think about even stepping back into the brink of smoking I remember that night 201 days ago when I was so frustrated in myself for not completing a project that I had three weeks for and was so devastated because it had been a recurring event in my life. I never want to be back at Day 0. I wish the best of luck to anyone out there reading this. I've been through that struggle and lemme tell ya when you replace smoking with another good activity your life will improve immensely. I'm also thankful for this community that showed me anything was possible. I hope the community is helping you out and that your real life friend group are an understanding bunch of people. See you at 300 days.

How about you all grow some fucking skin and not allow your (because not all of us have had the same inconveniences as you might have had) dissatisfaction with an arguable sub-par service turn into a bitch-fest. Granted you hurt EA, but you're also hurting the hard working developers whose only association with EA is a damn paycheck. Take a guess as to who you piss on the most when you declare that all PC gamers should stop enabling EA by not buying their games due to a faulty system that is likely temporary?Rome wasn't built in a day people; give it time.

m3cb4	-20409	1320655293	occupywallstreet	The UNIVERSAL Demand of OWS	There are many misconceptions about the demands with the Occupy Wall Street movement and the American populace remains divided. Here's why such a division should not exist. The one demand that is universal, the singular belief that is held sincere by protesters across America, is this:**Money should play no part in the workings of a government that is by the people, and for the people.** No *individual* should have an unfair influence in a free society, and a fair government. No *politician* should prioritize the success of his or her next campaign over his or her civic duties. No *voice* should speak with the power of more than one voice.This is what is at the heart of the problem, and this is what the people of OWS hope to correct. They care about their government, they see the injustice, and they are willing to take action. In a democracy, dissent **is** patriotic. Obedience and idleness are not.

But first, a rant.The nostalgia and humor r/gaming provided was fun. The incessant, inevitable, and constant whiny bullshit was not. How to get to the front page of r/gaming? Fuck EA, that's how. I swear to god there is a stampede of sheep every time some one has the goddamn **COURAGE** to post "Fuck Origin" or "Fuck EA" or "omg I love Valve"... and yet, in the midst of all this retardation and single mindedness, the comments are often filled with honest gamers who *do their research* before raising the Bullshit Flag. But anyways, I digress. Back to the rant.Fuck you people who pirate games. You hold the gaming industry back. You hold especially hold PC gaming back. You harm the developers. You harm the consumers. You essentially fuck everyone who are not as degenerate as you are.Fuck you people who whine about what is deserved. I think your boycott of Bioware is utterly pathetic. Let's face it- there's not a snowball's chance in hell your sense of self entitlement (or boycott) is going to work. "but but... Bioware's actions are so immoral! They are CHEATING US!!"Yeah, fuck that noise. **The day I accuse a company of cheating me, the consumer, is the day I feel I'm not getting my money's worth from them.** It is NOT the day I don't have everything go the way I want them to go. With ME3, I'm all but guaranteed to have dozens of hours of solid content and good story telling. For the price tag of $60. To put things in perspective, my getting a fucking haircut is 1/4 of that price. Buying a bag of chips is 1/10. Buying a burger combo is 1/8. Buying trash that is Modern Warfare is 1/1. *Oh shit, Bioware is totally cheating me. How dare they sell me an incomplete game. How dare they stoop to such levels! HEY R/GAMING, LISTEN AND UPVOTE!!!*Good fucking riddance, entitled asshats.Sincerely,A Disgruntled Redditor

However, when I think about the rest of the game, the 99% that was the pinnacle of voice acting and story telling in a video game, I can't help but feel satisfied. [After years of build up and escalation, finally resolving the conflict] (/spoiler) between the Geth and the Quarians was some of the most satisfying and well written work ever conceived in video games as a whole. Asimov may have been the hipster here, but I have a feeling he's smiling down on the writers of ME right now, at this modern interpretation.And that's just to name one of the many things that the game DID do well in. Well, that's my 2 cents anyways. It's just like life. No matter what we do, our ending is going to suck terribly; it's the getting there that really counts, IMO.*If this is not enough, which is understandable, the producers did say they have significant DLC plans which will "make you hold onto your copy of ME3 forever".*

Why is that every time this topic comes up, it is always about food?I'm sorry, but giving food aid to Africa is easing the symptom, not curing the problem. The entire northern part of the continent is rife with war and disease. There are few stable governments and even fewer honest ones. Access to education is non-existent in entire regions.There are entire governments whose sole purpose is to take advantage of external help and hoard material aid in order to strengthen their position. There are entire populations that live under constant fear for their lives. There are people who think raping babies and virgins will cure them of AIDS.When you think about these things, do you honestly think "oh, they're just not very well off because they don't have food."?

xhef6	-20409	1343786467	Games	If you guys want to try SWTOR since it will be free soon, try playing the IMPERIAL AGENT!	Some background:I bought the game when it first came out, solely based on the fact that I love Star Wars. I have never played an MMO before (well, except Runescape in middle school, but that was eons ago) and I have to say that if you love a fun story, making decisions, and the Star Wars universe, this game is definitely worth a try.I know that Bioware and EA are not popular names right now, but please don't let that poison your opinion of the game before you have even tried it. This game had flaws but the amount of hate it received was frankly beyond understanding. It is completely fine to hate Bioware and EA, and god knows they deserve some of the hate, but their artistic product is something that you should judge for yourself. Here's a personal example. I loved Ender's Game. The book was intelligent, eye opening, and raised many interesting and engaging questions and it is perhaps one of the greatest in the entire sci-fi genre. Orson Scott Card on the other hand, has some problems as a person. Does that invalidate his good writings? No. If you had a bone to pick with him, would you bash his books without reading them, or would you confront the person directly? You can protest by not buying his books, or not watching Ender's Game when it comes out in cinema, but you, as an honest person, would not seek to defame his literary works by attacking him on his personal beliefs, would you? You would treat that as something different. You would criticize the man for his beliefs, and his works on their own merits.Please, have some integrity and critical honesty. Don't let this misguided internet shitstorm sour your opinion of something before you have had the chance to personally witness it or experience it yourself. If you guys know Reddit, then you know that this community (and indeed the entire Internet) has an awful tendency to do just that. Don't be a part of the hivemind; make up your decision based on your own experiences. Ok, that's the end of my little rant, so now back to SWTOR itself. It was a *good* game. It was fun, engaging, and had 8 unique storylines, and from my experience playing the game, 16 different voice actors and actresses poured their heart into it. **minor spoilers**The Imperial Agent is the first class that I picked and I had an awesome time with it. I played the female version, and it was the same voice actress that played Hawke in DA2 (Fuck, was DA2 extremely disappointing. Voice acting was still top notch though). Both the male and female agent sound very "Imperial", ie classy and pretentious. It's classic Star Wars really. Literally within minutes you find yourself immersed in the environment. Your Imperial Intelligence overseer contacts you and instructs you to blend in and to not reveal your Imperial ties, and you would actually hear the voice actress do a different accent. Inside the hutt palace, there was actually a situation where a pirate who actually knows the person you are trying to impersonate, and confronts you. You can deal with him in a variety of ways. Playing as a female agent, you actually had options to seduce him in order to avoid paying his demands, or just kill him outright. Continuing with the seduction attempts, he offers that he is willing to overlook this incident... if you bedded with him. At this point, you can choose to do just that, or refuse him. If you refuse him, he gets angry and you will have to kill him. Remember that once you made your choice, it is actually impossible to go back to see how your other options have have played out! Once you get companions it is entirely up to you whether you want to see them around or not. Only in a very few situations would you need them out for storyline purposes. In a tight fight, you can summon them to help you, but that's entirely up to you. **major spoilers**Throughout your travels, you get to visit the Imperial City, many different worlds, and solve multiple plots that involves everything from attempting an assassination on a Sith lord, to plots to overthrow the Empire itself. There are major story arcs that provide you with such different options that you will find yourself at a loss to decide which one. For example, once I finished chapter 1 of my class story, I chose to **major major spoilers** refuse the offer of a Darth to overthrow the Emperor and to join him in his plot. Immediately, I wondered what would have happened if I instead chose to join him. Even now I still don't know what would happen if you joined him, because that would either require an entire second playthrough from the beginning or watching the videos on youtube. The Imperial agent makes you feel like you're playing a spy. Throughout the game, you engage in sabotage, espionage, and assassinations. You take on missions which leaves you wondering, did I really serve the good of the Sith Empire, or did my actions inadvertently hurt it? Are you going to be the suave and independent James Bond type, or the merciless killer that follows orders to the letter? There are too many awesome things about the agent storyline to list, so ask questions if you want to know something specific!Storyline: Very good, if not the best.Companions: Not as good as some of the other classes, but decent.Starship: Sexiest one available. Looks (gear): Think the Terran Ghost from Starcraft. I think they look awesome but looks are highly subjective. High tech, but none of the "holy crap that guy looks intimidating" you might get from the Sith classes.Combat: The 2 different specializations are completely different, and even within the two specializations you have different options. This means you can choose to be either melee specialist, healer, or ranged specialist and they are all really good.

Some background:I bought the game when it first came out, solely based on the fact that I love Star Wars.

10sikx	-20409	1349139181	Games	I know it is considered heresy to criticize Steam, but what if they took a little less than 30% of all sales and gave more to the developers?	I know a lot of people love Steam. I do too; it is an excellent service. Under the current system however, they are taking quite a chunk of money for every game sold, 30% to be exact, from game developers. Business is business, but I mean this extra income, should Steam take a little less, can benefit so many smaller developers! And yes, I understand that getting their indie games onto Steam in the first place is a huge boon already, but that's not my point. If Steam allowed a little more to slip into the developer's pockets, they can have even more resources to develop the games we enjoy so much. I'm not a developer, nor do I have ulterior motives for suggesting this. I mean, Valve only needs so much to fund their great service and develop new titles, so why not make a small investment and lower the rate. In the long run, it will probably even help Valve with an even greater influx of new games.

However, this also means that until you get it, your early game soldiers gain Will at a slower rate.I don't know about anyone else, but I would like soldiers that have stuck with me from the beginning, who are now colonels and majors, to have the same benefit as the later rookies. Right now, their Will is drastically lower than say a colonel who has had the benefit of Iron Will from the rookie level. This is also so important later on when training Psi soldiers.What do you guys think?

Also, what I have to say most likely will not be the first time that you've heard of them, but I just have to describe this trend I see and how much sense it *doesn't* make.The problem that I have identified as the foundation is the maps.To compensate for small maps, you need static aliens.To compensate for static aliens, you need to reduce squad size.To compensate for reduced squad size, each soldier must be capable of performing a multitude of actions.To compensate for each soldier's ability to perform a multitude of actions, you must have a class system, or else no soldier has any specific weaknesses.To compensate for a class system, you cannot have an extensive inventory system, which will defeat the purpose of class specific strengths and weaknesses.I still cannot wrap my head around this needless complexity.Why not bigger maps &gt; more aliens (from numbers and free movement) &gt; more soldiers &gt; more tactical gameplay?
12d8dt	-20409	1351639509	Xcom	Clearing some misconceptions and some additional tips I feel should be mentioned	1. Being out in the open has the same penalties as being Flanked. There are absolutely no differences between the two. Being Flanked from an enemy effectively means you are out in the open *to that enemy*. This of course means that you can be flanked, and still receive cover bonuses from enemies that are not flanking you.Whether you are flanked or out in the open, the only penalty you receive is a +50% critical chance against you. It is *not* inherently easier for enemies to hit you, nor does flanking an enemy make it inherently easier to hit them (it just takes away cover bonuses). 2. Want to research Blaster Bombs but haven't found an alien Battleship yet? Ignoring UFO contacts towards the late game will typically bring a Battleship contact that will attempt to destroy your satellite. Bradford will actually tell you something along the lines of "we're picking up a strange signal, almost like they're searching for something" which signals that said UFO is looking to shoot your stuff down. Of course, this does not work all the time, but if you're tired of doing each and every Small Scout missions, just let a few fly by and hopefully you will attract a Battleship. This even works on Impossible and you will *not* gain too much panic, provided this is late game.3. If possible, begin shooting with rear troops *then* shoot with troops that are closer to the enemy. Your own troops have the potential to blow up cover that is occupied by a friendly, and if this happens *after* you have already performed the 2 actions of said friendly, it is almost guaranteed that he will die because his cover is now gone.4. On Classic or Impossible, it is extremely difficult to skip laser weapons without serious consequences. Even if you rush straight to Containment *and* have S. America bonus, you are almost always going to run into Mutons before you finish Light Plasma research. I've tried this several times, and would not recommend this course.

I recently posted this question on another gaming reddit but didn't get much help. Wondering if you guys have some info or advice. So I'm looking at the price tag for a XL right now and it seems that the price still hasn't changed. It has been out for quite a while now, how likely is it that if I wait a while longer the price might drop? What do you guys think?I mainly want a 3DS to play Fire Emblem Awakening, having only recently discovered the series. I'm a fan of the Advance Wars series and I was thrilled to learn there was another highly rated TBS strategy game series by Intelligent Systems.The next installment of Advance Wars is also a big deal to me, and I would feel pretty stupid if I bought this console and IS doesn't release an AW game for the 3DS. Have there been any rumors of the next AW on the horizon? Will one even be made for the 3DS?Any information you guys can provide will be much appreciated.
19t717	-20409	1362615457	3DS	Guys, I've been missing out. What can you recommend?	A few weeks ago, I made a post asking about buying a 3DS and Fire Emblem: Awakening.At the time, I knew nothing about the series, only that it was made by the same people who did Advance Wars, and that made my very happy. After the post, I tried out the older Fire Emblem games, the North American GBA one, and it stunned me with its rich story, characters, and gameplay. I immediately bought a 3DS XL and FE:A, and I certainly wasn't disappointed either.So now I'm wondering... what the heck have I been missing? I know this is a 3DS subreddit, but I'm assuming you guys here are all Nintendo fans with previous handheld console experience.What are the other games I need to play? Assume I'm totally ignorant about anything Nintendo related. I'm mostly a fan of Turn Based Strategy, but I enjoy almost everything that tells a good story.
19tc5h	-20409	1362619253	fireemblem	The Fire Emblem series opened my eyes, and now I'm eager to try out other TBS/RPG games. 	When I first heard about Fire Emblem Awakening being released in NA, I had no idea what the big deal was about. I did some research, and found that it had a long history of great games, and more importantly (in my mind at least), it was made by the same company that made the Advance Wars games.I was very excited to learn that fact, so I downloaded an emulator and tried out the first Fire Emblem game released in NA, which was FE 7 for the GBA. I was completely shocked at the quality of the writing, the deep characters, and fantastic game play. I did not think such a level of strategy AND story telling was possible on a hand held console. Since it was made by Intelligent Systems, I felt safe in believing that the game play would not be disappointing, but wow... FE 7 told a story I would not forget for the rest of my gaming life. Literally a day later, after I finished FE 7, I bought a 3DS XL and FE:A. A day after that, I'm on my second playthrough. You guys must be fans of the TBS genre and games similar to the Fire Emblem series, so what have I been missing out? What other games can you guys recommend, similar to Fire Emblem?

I have no idea what is behind the motivation of the central plot of Book 1.More importantly, why is the Emperor so invested in Leto's death that he is even willing to commit Imperial troops? From what I understand, the Great Houses and the Emperor are two separate and powerful political bodies right, so what is so important that he is willing to put his personal stamp on the death of a leader of a great house?What the heck is spice?

1ek9g7	-20409	1368852266	changemyview	The death penalty should be WIDELY implemented for repeat offenders- people who have demonstrated time and time again that they cannot operate within society. CMV.	To set some background information (please note that the following idea is not up for CMV, at least for purposes of this discussion):I do not believe in universal human rights. Rights are the precious product of civilization. They are protected and granted by members of a society coming together, forming a mutual contract that seeks to serve in the best interest of all by demanding a small sacrifice and obedience from behalf of all. As gifts of society, rights can, at any moment, be taken away by society.Country of residence: United States, which has capital punishment laws, but are rare and difficult to carry out.Rehabilitation is good, IF the cost to society is outweighed by the potential gains. For criminals who have committed a single deplorable act, rehabilitation SHOULD be the first consideration. The value of a human life is its utility to society. If there is a potential utility that can be re-accessed without too much cost in terms of resources and personnel, then I am all for rehabilitation. However, not all criminals are able to benefit from rehabilitation into society, as our prisons filled with repeat offenders demonstrate. For these individuals, who have demonstrated time and time again that they are utterly incapable of changing their ways, the most logical choice is immediate summary execution (preferably mandatory organ donation). Humans who cannot exercise the ability to control themselves within a society should not be treated as humans, but as the lower functioning animals that they are. These are the cancers that eat away at the whole- unable to be cured, a burden to maintain, and of absolutely no utility to society. To increase the rate of capital punishments, repeat offenders should not be given the same level of trial time and consideration. They are not worth the resources. The justice system is already capable of making mistakes, and that is why the limited resources that it has should be spent on those who have committed only limited offenses, since their guilt is much less certain then those who already have been convicted multiple times. Also, there should not be a separate trial to determine guilt, and another one to determine eligibility for the death penalty, which greatly increases cost (United States).

1gbbqk	-20409	1371178571	anime	Hi all, I'm somewhat new to anime and a few shows I've watched recently really reignited my interest. I'm looking for a few specifics; care to offer some opinions?	I can't honestly say I'm a fan of anime, but having recently watched such great shows such as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Attack on Titan, I feel I can finally put to words what I am looking for in anime. I'm eager to get back into anime again, but I'm looking for solid series that contain a certain elements while lacking others.If you have the time and interest to help me out, please take a look at my *opinions*(I cannot stress this enough) and recommend a few series to me!**-A serious, well-told story.** Since Attack on Titan is still in the works, I have to point to FMA as a prime example of excellent story telling. The world felt alive. The characters felt real. Their problems and struggles, shortcomings, achievements and sometimes even deaths were tangible things that worked together to bring meaning and power to the overall story. The first half of Sword Art Online is another prime example of what I consider to be good story telling. **-No fanservice.** It is perfectly fine to like it, but I personally despise it. It just completely throws me out of the show. I have no problem with sex or erotica, but it has to be done reasonably, with a mature audience in mind and within the larger context of the story. **-Humor that is intelligently delivered through dialogue, circumstance, and character interaction (IE good writing), and NOT through goofiness and silly animation.** I feel like FMA, as much as I love it, is a big violator of this. Humor in my opinion, when done right, should be subtle, intelligent, and does not detract from the overall tone. The humor in Attack on Titan for example, while sparse, felt 100x more real than in FMA. What would you sooner forget, Sasha Braus the potato girl and the interactions between the soldiers of the trainee corps, or the bland and generic humor that are products of ridiculous animation and loud screaming?
1he37x	-20409	1372633718	changemyview	I believe that Capitalism and Democracies cannot co-exist. The former will inevitably degrade and destroy the latter. CMV	*Whenever I say democracy, I mean all forms of democratic governance. This includes a republic, democratic republic, true democracy, etc.*Whenever I say capitalism, I mean all forms of capitalism. This includes true capitalism, socialist elements within a majority capitalist system (such as US), and majority socialist elements within a minority capitalist system (select nations of Europe).*Whenever I say "private" as in private interests or groups, I also include publicly traded companies. Let's face it, just because a company is publicly traded does not mean power and authority is equally distributed. Power still rests in the hands of the very few and is, in almost all cases, highly inaccessible to the general public, hence the word private.  Now here is why I hold this view.Statement 1. Capitalism, in all its forms, is about private control to the means of production. Now the extent to which private control is exercised is what creates the varying degrees of capitalism, but nonetheless they all share this trait.Statement 2. Whenever there is private control to the means of production, successes and failures in the free market will mean the accumulation of massive wealth into the hands of the very few.Statement 3. The figures behind powerful corporate entities will inevitably have undue influence in politics, disproportionate to their numbers. This is an inevitable result of massive concentration of the means of production into the hands of the few- instead of answering to the government (and thus the people), the government will have to answer to them. Statement 4. In a democracy, the public does not have any control whatsoever over private groups. They may only influence political matters. (No, "voting with your wallet" does not count as control. I'm not talking about the Electronic Arts of the world, but the Exxon Mobils)Statement 5. A government for the people, by the people, will eventually degrade into a faux government because it no longer matters who the people vote into power; those voted in will answer to the same entities, who are beyond the reach of the people, and their influence.Statement 6. Democracy is destroyed. An oligarchy rises. Please ask me to elaborate further if you disagree with something or do not understand why I feel a certain way, and please try to poke some holes in my line of thinking.

8ua99	-20410	1245564709	Marijuana	The Marijuana Paradox	I am 31 years old and have used cannabis regularly since I was 15. Recently I made the decision to stop smoking cannabis mainly with the intent of observing the changes to my behaviors both psyclogically and socially. Now, I want to begin with the caveat that this was not a scientific study. The following account is nothing more than my own subjective observations and opinions surrounding the circumstances.I currently consume about half a gram of smoked cannabis daily over the course of three smoking "sessions" per day. While I occasionally drink in social settings and may occasionally take other recreational drugs, cannabis is the only psychotropic substance I ingest on a regular basis. For 30 days I attempted to refrain from smoking weed. During the beginning of the hiatus, I felt no change in mind state or outward behavior. About five days in, I began to have difficulties at work; feeling overwhelmed and anxious. Every minute seemed to be an hour. Upon heading home, I was not content. I was restless and often sought out alcohol to experience an altered mind state. Twenty days in and I had behaved ridiculously at work, around friends and around myself. I was angry and unsettled. It was difficult to "vibe" socially. I had alienated myself and decided to head home for the weekend. When at home I began to unwind some but then began to drink and take synthetic opiate painkiller pills as well as Valium. While on my drinking and drug binge, I contacted some friends and said some asshole things.I headed back to my house on Sunday and that Monday, I began smoking cannabis again. I made it a bit more than three weeks but decided that it was better for myself and better for society if I consume marijuana. It was the responsible thing to do. Upon resuming my regular consumption of marijuana, I was immediately functional and felt "well".So here's the paradox. It's quite obvious that I have addictive tendencies. I am not arguing that. What I am arguing is that consuming cannabis keeps my mind at ease and that depriving myself of it is a reckless act. While I think it would be great to be well enough to not rely on any substance, the best substance for my regular consumption is marijuana. Marijuana keeps me from being an addict.

93qyz	-20410	1248329827	AskReddit	This is a letter I felt compelled to write to an ex girlfriend of mine. How does it come across to you? 	Before I get started, I want to begin with the caveat that this will be my last communication with you. So don't freak out. I am not saying anything bad here. There are just a few things I want to get off my chest, some emotional roadblocks that I'd like to dismantle so I can proceed peacefully with my life.You cared for me and Ivy well. Even though we fought a lot, I always felt loved and cared for by you. I was originally attracted to you because you were so non-judgmental and seemed to see right my through my flaws, to my core, in which I am a good person. You were my Blind Mary. We struggled ferociously to make it, we lived on nothing but a prayer sometimes, yet we stuck together. It was me who always had contempt for you, who was always judging you and starving you emotionally. I feel like if I had just given you a little bit more love, like five percent more, you would have been so much happier. You just wanted me to love you, to show that I loved you.I know it's too late. I'm not trying to seduce you back. I really just want you to know that I don't blame you for anything. I'm not mad at you about anything. You were good to me and I was bad to you. I am so sorry I kicked you out on the streets, (Her Name). What a fucked up thing to do? And afterward you still didn't hate me, you tried to spend time with me, you cooked dinner for me. You're virtue is forgiveness. In this category, you are a saint.I want to put all this behind me, I really do. As much as I have been avoiding it, I feel a great sense of loss. I miss you, spending days off together, smoking weed, making love and so fourth. I really miss the warmth you brought to my life, that is something that is not easily replaced. But I understand that I did not return the warmth that you gave me and that is why you had to leave. It's OK though, I've got plans, I've got things going on all the time, I'll be fine. I just want to give you a proper goodbye and let you know that you were a good girlfriend to me.

What all the haters don't understand about pickup is that these guys sincerely give a shit about each other and have a strong rallying point around attracting beautiful women. I want you guys to know that I have only been at it for a few months but have had some good nights out with a recent HB9 fclose. I'm really getting a hang for vibing socially and coming off as high value. There is no doubt in my mind that I have what it takes to become a mPUA. I just need some rocking cool pickup buddies and a big ass, west coast city to play around in.

9id45	-20410	1252401136	seduction	This past weekend, I f-closed 2 girls on 2 different nights. One of them is a stripper. On top of all this, I was flat broke, completely busted. I think I'm getting the hang of this pickup thing.	Earlier last week I started shooting text messages back and forth with this unnamed girl. I teased her, I demonstrated high value and social status. I had her qualify herself to me. Finally, on Friday night, she says she wants to come over. we smoke some weed end up on the bed. Some cuddling caressing and such, go for a move. shot down. no problem. get up go to kitchen get a drink cut back on lights check email. Get back to bed. She's like "ill sleep under the comforter you sleep on top" (mainly due to body temperature differences). Realizing the difficult logistics of the situation, I decide to step outside with my dog for a second. Get back, under the covers, this time. "Will you massage me?" she asks. (she missed me) "Sure." I say. (She's face down). I start getting into the 'incidental' touching Dicarlo talks about, did the Jedi mind trick where the incidental touching turns into intentional touching. By this time, she'd rolled onto her back and as soon as I started brushing her titties, she asked me to go down on her. I did. Then we had vigorous, full-release intercourse.And then just a few hours ago, I was getting ready to watch a movie and for whatever random reason, chronic internet bordem I guess, I checked my myspace, something I do maybe once a month. When I get on there this girl I added while partying at some friend's house the other week, she sends me an IM. So were like la ti da, fluff and then I ask her what is the normal amount of times she likes to have sex with a person when they sleep over. I said that I like it twice at night and once in the morning. We moved onto orgasms and other naughty things. Anyhow she says she's so bored (which ironically sometimes can be an IOI) so I invite her over. No last minute resistance there. We were having sex within fifteen minutes.That's pretty much it. I just wanted to share my field report with my redditor PUAs. Cheers guys.

9k8jn	-20410	1252896414	Marijuana	We all smoke marijuana for medical reasons: A little pro-legalization essay or whatever inspired by my research and discussions on the MJ subreddit. 	I am calling upon all individuals in America who consume and enjoy marijuana: You must stop feeling guilty for consuming cannabis. If you crave weed because it improves your state, then you are medicating yourself. You have as much of a right to smoke a joint as a person has to take an antidepressant. We all smoke marijuana for medical reasons. Tell your doctors and lawmakers that marijuana is your preferred treatment and that you demand legal access to it. Get high whenever you feel you need to, if the police come for you tell them it's your medicine. If you go to court, plead not guilty, tell the judge you discussed marijuana therapy with your physician and that the state has no business interfering with your medical treatment.We, the ganja enthusiasts, need to liberate ourselves from the notion that there is anything morally wrong with consuming marijuana before the laws will change in our favor. We cannot wait for governmental bodies to "come around" to the notion of marijuana legalization. Rather, we have to assume safe access to marijuana is an intrinsic right that we have as humans and we will not be timid about acquiring and consuming cannabis. Only then will the law curve into congruence with our beliefs.

9nx9l	-20410	1253859477	vegan	The dairy cow dilemma. Vegan reddit, I really need your insight here.	Let me begin with the caveat that I fully support veganism.  I am not arguing against it here.The first few years of my life, of which I barely remember, were spent on my family's dairy farm in northern Virginia. While the farm was sold in the mid eighties, my mom lived and worked from early childhood until her mid twenties on the farm. Now this was *not* a gentleman's farming endeavor. My mom and her siblings were out there at 5 am and 5pm 365 days a year milking those cows, getting slapped in the face with their piss-soaked tails.What I'm trying to illustrate here is that my mom *knows* dairy cattle and the milk business like very few do.According to mom, if dairy cattle, like Holsteins, are not milked daily their udders will distend and become abscessed. The animal will suffer terribly and die. This is due to the hyper-lactating nature of the bovine's genetics.Well let's say that next week the demand for milk completely dries up.What do we, as humans, do will all of those dairy cows? It doesn't seem very ethical to euthanize them all. Yet, if they are not milked the cows die in agony. Now I understand that this is a primarily conceptual argument and it is highly unlikely that we will face such a dilemma in our lifetimes. Nonetheless, becoming vegan is primarily an ethical decision and this argument, like many in the field of ethics, in a theoretical one.I'm curious to know how the vegans of reddit reconcile the decision to abandon dairy products with the fact that cows have been genetically molded to require milking.I'm also curious to know any arguments or sources that you may have countering what my mom says about cows dying if they're not milked. Honestly, I hope her statement is spurious.

I wonder sometimes, these people with 3+ KDRs, how often they quit when things aren't going just their way.**Edit 1:** It seems that there are two polarized views on the topic of rage quitting best exemplified by the following two comments:The below comment exemplifies the "take the good with the bad and be a man/good sport" mentality.&gt;**lonelliott** says: What ever happened to sportsmanship?...You win some, you lose some. If you cant finish a ten minute game because things are not going your way, what does that say about someone as a person?The following comment reflects a mindset of "this is a video game that's mine to have fun with -- why would I continue playing a match that isn't fun?" mindset.&gt;**shagoth** says: It seems to me that playing a game is about having fun. When it stops becoming fun...it's time to quit and I do. I won't stay in a bad situation that isn't getting better.Both have logical an ethical validity. I generally tend to lean toward the former, in practice; I often wonder, though, if I wouldn't extract more enjoyment out of the game if I would just back out of matches that were essentially "not fun".So it seems to boil down to one question: Is a person who backs out mid-match exhibiting poor character or are they simply doing their best to have fun playing the game they paid for?

bvwsh	-20410	1272220560	MW2	What sort of "damage control" tactics do you implement when you find yourself going negative in a strictly kill-based game type?	As a casual, average player of the game, it doesn't really bother me to finish at the middle to bottom of the leader board at the end of a match -- even if I go negative a few kills.I would be lying though, if I said I did not feel pretty shitty when I have a match where I am getting killed all over the place and at the same time struggling to fish out even a few kills of my own.I know we have a lot of great players on the MW2 subreddit, but everyone finds themselves in a match occasionally where they are under-performing and a bit disgusted with themselves for it.What I want to know is how you turn these unfavorable situations around or at least what you do to keep them from spiraling out of control.
bw1t9	-20410	1272252705	MW2	Tonight, I joined a Free For All match and there was some booster schmuck in there calling in nukes with a four kill streak. What is this? This boosting bullshit has gotten out of control.	
bw47o	-20410	1272266394	MW2	Why do people boost? All the reasons I can think of are so incredibly stupid that I feel I must be missing something. 	Boosting is one of the rudest forms of cheating I have ever come across. These people who pay for tenth prestige lobbies, they're stupid too but, they are really only cheating themselves out of the challenge of the game they (or more likely, they're mom) paid for.Boosters on the other hand, have actually *wasted* a considerable amount of my leisure time with their homoerotic headshot swapping antics. Sometimes I might only have 30 minutes or so to game before I have to do life responsibility shit. So I spend 20 minutes getting signed in, finding a match, tweeking my kit, getting my kills and then some booster troll calls in a nuke and jumps to the top of the leader board when I have 21 legit kills posted----That's wasting my time and diminishing my achievements in the game and it's fucking childishly rude and flagrant . And why? What for? So they can tell the mostly anonymous people on their friends list that they've called in 50 nukes? So that they have some new emblem to post next to their name that they "earned" swapping headshots with one of their juvenile, ignorant, douchey friends? These "boosters" are one low, low breed of gamer in my book and they disgust me.

gegpz	-20410	1301458172	atheism	Today I confronted my 16 year old brother who is being brainwashed by the Wesleyan Church to attend their academically questionable institutions and abandon his dreams of attending a legit Ivy League University.	I am 33 years old but my youngest brother is 16. Anyway he's more like a kid to me than a sibling and I love him immensely.I grew up going to Methodist church. Never was serious about the stuff they said -- always seemed far-fetched, even as a little guy -- but I had a good time in the youth group and some of my closest friends now as an adult are people I went to church with.While I never identified as a Christian in anymore than a cultural context, I did find myself in my late teens and early twenties seeking religion, mostly studying Eastern religions like pretty much most liberal arts college matriculates.I suppose it was my mid-twenties that I started to see how life was its own reward (mind altering substances played a big role in this) and that there was no need for any sort of invisible sky man to guide me in my life or reward me in the future. "Trust Yourself" is the mantra I chose to live life by.Back to my brother. Like I said, I grew up Methodist and so did he, until about age 13 in which he and my parents began attending a Wesleyan Church. While not a mega church, it is pretty big. Maybe 400 members or so.Well since being a little kid, my little brother was heart-set on attending a Duke University which is incredibly hard to gain acceptance into even for the top performers in top private schools. This is a dream which is quite feasible because both his father (different than mine) and grandfather are both Duke alumni and have donated to the university for decades. Plus my brother has the brains and academic record to get in, or at least give it a good shot.Well, at this Wesleyan church they've been attending, they are always promoting these Wesleyan junior colleges and universities to the kids in the youth group there. My brother has been completely brainwashed and now wants to be a youth minister and attend Wesleyan junior college and then Indiana Wesleyan University.When I learned that the youth group was travelling 12 hours in the coming weekend to attend this scheisty church college, I had to intervene.Up until that point I told myself I would not interfere because at his age I was way more concerned with procuring beers and weed than reading Bible verses and I thought the latter better than the former.After considerable thought, though, I realized that I was the only voice of opposition in little bro's life and that I had to put my voice forward.I will try my best to paraphrase our conversation accurately:I asked him if wanted to attend Wesleyan schools and become a youth pastor. "Yes" he said."What about Duke? You've always wanted to go to Duke." "I don't know.""Christianity says that people who don't believe what they believe will be tortured forever, do you believe that?""That's what it says...""What about someone born on the other side of the planet, in India to Hindu parents, are they going to be tortured forever just because they weren't born to Christian parents like you?""..."[long pause]"Come on, talk to me about this! You want to be a youth pastor and you can't even talk to your own brother about your Christianity.""I don't believe in God and I'll tell you why. If God exists, God either is too weak to exert influence on our world, is ambivalent to human suffering or is just evil. It makes more sense to me to not believe God exists.""...""If God exists then why is God hiding?!" "I have the faculties to observe the world around me. Where is God?""..."So after this it was very quiet and awkward. I felt guilty even though I did what I felt was right. I think it has to do with him finding comfort in church stuff. In a way I am happy that he gets joy from church but I think they are hijacking my little brother's dreams. He is a very smart kid and I don't want him falling into this pyramid scheme.Youth pastors aren't exactly what I'd call "scum of the earth" but I hold a great contempt for them and I don't want my brother to waste his life and education on such a slimy endeavor.Your thoughts /r/atheism? Have any of you found yourself in a similar situation?EDIT: I so appreciate all your input and will respond to more, but I'm at  work so I'll be typing up responses as I get time throughout the day.

je6cl	-20410	1312944350	phleef	Comedy is a language.	Comedy is a language. There is a certain mental space where it is the native language.It is about how one observes the world and processes it.I had a dream once where I was surrounded by people, maybe several dozen. Everyone was laughing uncontrollably at the things I was saying and doing in front of them. It was one of the most euphoric experiences I've ever experienced and the funny thing was, it was easy for me, effortless, really.I never have understood my role in life. I have always studied and written comedy. I mean I was the front man for Nutrition Fullness Biscuit and wrote all those songs that those guys still perform today.So waht I'm thinking about is starting up a podcast where I can talk about things and listen to it later. Even if you don't put them all up. I have been listening to a lot of podcasts from different comedians and I want to do my own podcast. I think it is one of the greatest media formats. I like how there are opportunities to be funny and also explore the human condition and what comes along with that.What I'm  getting at is that to be successful in comedy you have to have a large body of work. It isn't the only way but it is a pretty failsafe method in that the worst you can end up with is thousands of pages and hours of trying to be funny. And even if that's not funny it is funny that you put that much work into it and still weren't funny.There is an transformative/rebirth aspect to this comedy thing too. I want to do comedy under an assumed name, Joel Fulburne. I want this to me my new persona, my reinvention of myself with all the good things about myself and without the shitty thing that have held me back from getting what I want out of life.When I do the first podcast I will post it here.

jgr4d	-20410	1313156755	phleef	My dick knows.	As a single man, masturbation takes a front and center role in my life. What's funny about it is how my cock and balls seem to know, you know if it's real or not. Just hang with me here, alright. So what I'm saying is that i can be watching some intense porn, with like three exotic beauties, triple-teaming some dude all kinds of orifices being penetrated and that get me hard. But my dick knows its fake. I can tell because once I get to climax it's like this fucking itty bitty cum comes trickling out. But my dick knows the real deal. On the off chance that a woman becomes drunk enough to allow me to molest her for a few minutes, well thats a totally different ballgame. Even if we don't go very far, second base even, you know just some french kissing and over-the-garmet groping, my dick knows this is the real deal and calls in the auxillary sperm troop reserves. So lets say no sex happens, home girl bounces, my balls feel like they've tripled in fucking weight, they're in fucking high gear. Now after something like that, jerking off is a totally different animal. With the porn, it sort of like deciding to have cup of tea, this proper, semi-planned event. But when I've had a real woman that I've successfully molested, but didn't come, jerking off becomes a fucking code red level 5 emergency. When Im jerking off after that is like rumbling starts all deep in my loins and about 15 seconds later my dick turns into a fucking semen geyser, pumping out gallons of jizz uncontrollably over like a 5 foot radius. When that happens you know you've made a nice fat deposit, to the Spank Bank. You know you're going to revisit that one.I also think there is a bit of a fallacy in what masturbation means to a man. And not just by women but men as well. We tend to characterize masturbation as this second-rate alternative to real sex. As if the about to masturbate man thinks "OK not getting laid tonight, better jerk off". Well this is true but I know personally, I've had some hot sex-crazed girlfriends who've pretty much opened up the sex buffet for me. But still I will find these sneaky private moments to jerk off. Why? some may ask, just go have sex with your hot girlfriend. I'll tell you why...because masturbation has a little-know second function as a mans personal sportscenter for sex. I mean think about it, how much less good would football be if the big plays were never revisited in sports center. Sure it's most exciting when that big play happens when you're watching the live game, but an integral part of the process is reliving that later on. That is the little known secondary function of male masturbation. When I'm at a point when I'm having a lot of sex in my life, I'll masturbate more than normal because there's so many fucking highlight reels rolling through my head. Like one time I was sexually involved with this really hot asian chick, she was tiny maybe 100 lbs. Any way so were doing all this intense sex and she ends up on top of me like riding me and what does she do? She reaches around her back and grabs my balls, and just rides and grinds fondles my balls. I was like "wow!" this is definetley going to make the spank bank highlight reels and I will relive and revel in that shit during my next wank like a fucking 80 yard touchdown in overtime, son.

Look, black people I just want to tell you, I'm only about a tenth of white as I appear to you.I don't know what it is but when I have to walk in front of black people  I feel like I'm suddenly transformed into my alter ego: Whitey McWhiterson.So you know I'm there getting ready to leave my apartment for work in the ethnically diverse neighborhood...I'm walking out the door, feeling like a pretty cool dude (saturday night fever walk) (nice and clean, earbuds in, shirt pressed) Then I notice on the patio acrross the way...two black people...It's like a fuckin vampire in the sunlight...suddenly I'm converted into WHitey McWhiterson (nerdy walk)HOw is that? That things can be two ways at once. It's like quantum mechanics and superpositioning and all that shit. It says that all possibilities exist simultaneously all potential outcomes. WHat I want to know is when can I simultaneously be at the office working and also be playing xbox and getting a lapdance. THat's my kind of multitasking.
jxqbb	-20410	1314598668	phleef	Dog size prejudice 	Hi out there everyone of the world. WHat the hell is shaking, people? What was that, cmon. THere are some crunk mutherfuckers out there tonight, ummhmm.ummmhmmm.WHat the fuck is that anyway?ummmhmmm.I'll tell you one thing though, no body know s how to summons the power of the ummmhmmm like an old black woman. THat shit carries some weight people.Man I tell you, I love black people, though. YOu know how I got to love black people? Working for a bank.THat's right, working for a bank.I don't like to admit this but I earned a living for a brief while as a phone operator for a bank which was essentially some sort of verbal gladiator zone over overdraft fees. Of course being the ones who did it day in and day out, most people couldn't really compete.That why I liked black people cause they didn't even put up much of a fight. YOu see black people are plenty used to being fucked over. That's why I see the line ringing in and saying "please let this be a black person."to myself. Cause this is what it's like getting a white person: (imitate white woman minnesota accent)Black person to me: So the bank done fucked me over, ME: yeahThats going to be a tough joke to float.I was thinking about the McKensian sense of a cultural operating system. McKenna said that such an operating system was your mortal enemy. When we take psychedelics in high enough, it's kind of like having a pc where the operating system in it is Windows 7, where the W7 is the normal cultural operating system and you then take a usb drive with the linux open source OS and boot from that. You are using the same hardware but accessing and processing data in a very different way. When the plants are injested, you are essentially booting into some sort of open source consciousness. you are existing outside of your cultural operating system.Sacred plants are one way to shed the cultural operating system, but not the only way. I propose that if you say "fuck it" to such an outrageous extent, rampantly thrashing apart the fabrics of decentcy and morality, that you separate yourself, become some hideous beast however so briefly.That's what I intend to do and I intend to do it with comedy. Seriously to me, if it's not comedy, it's fucking boring. I think that a lack of sense of humor is the biggest threat on the planet. Sure there are times to be serious. Like when your evacuating a building engulfed in flames. Some people are serious about sports, I could give a shit about any sport. Sports bore the fuck out of me, even depress me really. Shit, it's fucking pathetic all these old furry people intoxicating themselves with nachos and coronas cheering on a bunch of college boys in tight pants. As someone who's managed to be raised here in a house where sports were as sacred as Jesus. Any dog lovers out there tonight? HEll yah love me some dogs. And let me let you all in on a little secret: I am King of the dogs. Every time I see one of those beasts they go apeshit. Because I'm the king. You all think I'm kidding but its true. Protip here listen...be a dude that like to walk in the woods and don't mind dogs tagging along. Bring them with you I think a dog might like a walk more than I like pussy!Thats right people with dogs when you get home, before you pass out in drunkeness, Take that pooch for a walk.Yeah I fuckin love dogs. I do have a bit of a size predjudice when it comes to dogs though. NO! to all you sick fucks, I'm not talking about the dog penis size! I'm talking about general weight and size. Like a dog that's less than ten pounds for example...it's not that I don't like them and they "yip yip" and all that I can deal with that. You see my problem is that I just feel a compulsion to just punt dogs of that size. I mean I would never, never fucking do it. But visualizing it (mime it)whap! Just kicking that fucker right over the hill...I'd have to admit, pleases me. Hearing the little doppler effect (mimic) I'd never do such a thing.And the big dogs great danes, my compulsion is to just hug the shit out of them. I like to get my grill like right up in a dogs grill, I know it's dangerous, but goddamn that's a friendly zone right there. That's were the friendliness emanates from a dog, the head. That's scientecfully proven.
jxqve	-20410	1314600036	phleef	Why not just be gay?	...(spin off of "my dick knows") What if there was a pill that would make a man gay?I bet a lot more dudes than you think would take it, I mean how fucking easy is that, if a hetero dude was having the hardest time getting laid like years without sex, if he turned gay, he would definitley  be getting sex. it'd just be gay sex.You know there have to be dudes that have been in that situation and tried gayness, but it didn't work out like at all. That could make for some awkward scenarios. {Gay lover skit: Pound my ass damnit! But it smells like balls and manturds! AAhhh I can't do it! runs out the door}You know that shit's gone down there's 7 billion peep on this planet, its happened.I certanitly dont have anything aginst gay cultures and lifestyles. I mean it's kind of a barometer of the level of acceptance of the community. PLaces where people can be gay openly, within reson, are the best places to be in my opinion. But gay men please forgive me but as a straight comic, you have to understand that I find male on male asspounding the most hilarious thing possible in the universe. I might even could have been one of you but if I found myself in that situation  predicament, the joke mill in my brain would be spinning so fuckin fast that there no way I could maintain a boner. Of course I would never have a boner in the first place because as stated earlier I am not gay, totally not at all one bit not even like 7% gay. I mean yeah sure I have some dildos I mean sure some might call it a small collection. but just because a man collects rubber penises doesn't mean he's gay! And I'll tell you not one of my large collection of large dildos and vibrators is pink. Now if you had pink one, that's totally gay, Gross. But me not meee noooo. My dildos are manly dildos.

This is a ten minute power type session braindump.Hey every one thanks for coming out, not much else to do in this shithole town so I feel so privileged to being a slightly more appealing option to the wal-mart parking lot.What's going on out there tonight, who is celebrating a special occasion?I feel that comedy is an underestimated force in this world. I feel like if more people had a better sense of humor we would have near the problems we have today.THat's right. I was watching this documentary by Banksy, the famous London Graffiti artist. It was called "The ANtics Roadshow".One of the blurbs in this Documentary was a short story about riots in Northern Ireland...not so much riots but they were chucking stones and setting fires and the like. And considering this was Ireland, it goes without saying that no alcohol at all was involved...eh, em. All these riot patrol vehicles come out and were having a tough time getting things under control. Finally one of the armored trucks that had been deployed to the scene, one of the cops inside, started broadcasting over the loudspeaker the ice cream truck music...that's right. Suddenly both warring factions dropped their projectiles and went limp with laughter...THat right. Comedy can save the world.Imagine if you could drop a laugh bomb on a place, just make everyone within radius start cracking up. THere is not a single person in this world, friend or foe, who I wouldn't want to see tormented with laughter. And another thing, you get two people laughing together and see how long they stay enemies for. Imagine that, though, the coolest thing would be the people that were hit with the laugh bomb in the most grave and serious situations. The guy doing the autopsy, judges, big night club bouncers, just like pissing themselves laughing. I once had an uncle who made me laugh so hard as a kid, not a little kid either, like 11 or so, that I pissed my pants. And the funniest thing thinking back to it is the look on his face. It was a mix of bewilderment and disgust with a tinge of pride. I mean that is a comedy achievement right there. Make someone piss their pants. I'd be proud of that. If I could make all of yous soil your selves, hell yeah I'd do it. I don't think the comedy club would have me back, but It'd be worth it.

Don't feel so chipper today last night dreamed of trying to fortify a house for some sort of zombie attack and there were all these multiple doors with dead bolts and I was trying to make sure they were all deadbolted then would remember one like down in the basement that was not yet locked and the zombies or whatever were drawing ever closer. Very stressful.WOke up with a fucking headache, don't you just love waking up with a fucking headache. Especially when you haven't been drinking. I have this hierarchy that I go through when I have a headache. Because I am a headache pussy. I am a little bitch when it comes to having a headache. WHen I first notice it, I go for the caffiene-infused otc painkillers, Excederen in the south, BC powders you know that kind of shit. There is one thing, though my last line of defense, no headache yet has been able to withstand: A double shot of Nyquill and a hot bath.That's 5. Will add later

kawkj	-20410	1315634453	phleef	"secret meat" (not comedy it's about veganism)	I need to do more typing, less browsing. First I have to skim all the bullshit off the top and get down to the kernel. I've been doing this vegetarian diet and it is going alright. I haven't  weighed myself but my clothes are looser for sure. I'm not vegan by any means but my preferred meal or ideal meal is vegan. It will be hard to phase milk and cheese out but I don't take ovo lactarian vegetarianism very seriously, because thats still consuming the reproductive tissue of animals, the fact that a slaugher isn't necessary, doesn't make them any ethically better because the animals and the workers that work with them are held in unacceptable conditions. I feel like the vegan diet is the future diet of the human race. It is the best way to make the best of the earth and the best of our bodies. People love to attack veganism but you can't really attack that.With that being said it is going to be...not so hard maybe. I think the hardest part is going to be declining it when offered or served up freely. I will just have to think of milk as "secret meat". "secret meat" that sounds funny and gross.--------I almost titled this and shut down, but I feel like I have to keep plowing on. There is something in me that has to get out. What are you thinking about in your head. Stop trapping your thoughts to the imaginary. Cut those fuckers loose. Open up the sphincter of your mind, Leave it all behind you behind. Can you ever making something that is comedy but not dirty. Evidently Fluffy keeps a clean family friendly act. This is not a family friendly place, reddit. This is one of the greasy shitholes of the internet. This is a vile and decrepit corner of reddit. But at least /r/phleef is honest with itself.The way I look at it, I can create this mini-civilization all within reddit. One where I play all the roles, at least to a point I want readers and commentors from outside myself but I am going to attract them buy making hundreds of pages of my writings and comments on them. ideally  I would work hundreds of novelty accounts along with it to make it the perfect art but the fact of the matter is that that is a pain in the ass. So I post comments myself like some forever alone loser. I can say that because I know I'm not a forever aloner. I'm just not around people, cool people, enough. I know that might come off as smug but I'm not in college or anything. I work in a software engineering company with a shitload of dudes. Like dudes with kids and there isn't a seething urban community here. I don't have peers here or at least I've yet to meet them. I suppose doing comedy is an attempt an trying to draw people into me. A beacon of my values and opinions on shit with some chuckles thrown in.Speaking of shits and giggles, Joey Diaz is the funniest person I've ever known. I see why Joe Rogan says that he's his favorite comic. Joey is the real deal. I say that expression probably too much but I really mean it here. It's hard to put your finger on. He's like the gruffest person you could imagine yet at the same time he's the most loveable person you could imagine.I know this is lame but I have to get to bed and I havent been posting lately. This isn't commedy gold but you have to get this out to bring the funnies on. It doesn't matter anyway because this is your place where you can do things exactly how you want.

kcqvr	-20410	1315802112	phleef	"Action Baby" [part personal part comedy brainstorm]	This is a 30 minute purge. This whole time I have to sit here and type. Not just type but write. I went to help my Dad move into his new apartment in Cary. He's been living with his girlfriend in this shitty town called Henderson that's a hour from his work and is an all around shitty place.It was cool driving through Cary because I could identify with so many locations. I don't have that here in Winston-Salem. Winston Salem is also a shit town. Way better than Henderson I suppose. I sometimes think there is this secret cultural underbelly of Winston that I've yet to discover but I keep coming up disappointed. That one dude did send me that message on reddit saying that there were the EDM nights at two local clubs. Who knows, maybe I'll start going up there and really getting into the scene.It's a tricky situation I'm in now because I'm looking at buying a house but I would like to leave the area. If I'm going to end up staying in this area, then I need to buy a house, although the place I rent now is pretty damn cheap I'm still throwing away money though. I could possibly end up in Greensboro, Winston, Raleigh or Hollywood. I'd like to go live in Hollywood so I could go up and see good comedy all the fucking time and maybe get to know some comedians there and become one myself. I know it sounds far flung and it is but I feel like there is a chance ther and what really is there to lose. It's not like I'd be leaving a kid behind to go persue my dream. I just have to make sure that I can keep some income coming in I guess doing tech support. And if I'm going to do that then I really need to get the Microsoft cert which isn't a huge deal but that means I can't spend so much time fucking around which is like my favorite past time. But if I could get that certification, which is essentially just a matter of studying, I could make it in LA. I have to think this out though, because I need to keep my family in mind especially Dad who is looking at a knee replacement and Mike who needs an intervention. I know that Dad is tired of working and is in no way prepared for retirement. My thought is that I can get a good situation going in Cali and bring Dad out there to hang with me. I want  him to have a healthy and leisurely rest of his life. I want that to be my  gift to him. I'm not talking about buying him a Bently and shit like that, but just like having a nice place for him to stay and hang out and do fun things with him and have enough resources to basically keep him as a human pet. That sound awful but that's what's going through my mind.Now that I've got that garbage out of the way, am I ready to write some funny shit? I don't know there's still a lot of practical stuff going on inside my mind. My personal thought struggles are so fucking boring, I guess everyone's are.I was having some funny thoughts going through my mind today, but more like skits than jokes. I think it would be funny to have a skit where the protagonist is "Action Baby""Action Baby" is like one of the realistic baby dolls that is dressed up in some sort of Patric Swazee Roadhouse outfit. The baby which the actors pretend is real is the hero. The joke is that the thing that the baby 'does' to be a hero are centered around the sort of physical size and dead weight of a baby. Just hang with me here, hear me out. One example would be like a good guy is chasing a bad guy and cant climb over a wall. He's just short of making it. Well, then Action baby steps in and basically just gets stepped on so the guy can make it over the wall. Another possible scenario may be like some said third world kids who don't have any playgroud balls to play with. Action baby saves the day by converting his body into the teatherball. Another scenario I've thought up is like a grappling hook scenario where Action Baby is the grappling hook.Another variation on the super hero comedy theme would be like this overweight 'Dildo Man' who has all sorts of dildo-based gadgets that he uses in an almost accidental fashion to stop crimes and what not. It would be a good medium for all the dildo apparattsses  I've thought of like didlo nunchucks, dildo pitch fork, dildo tipped grappling hook.I went to the open mic the other night at the Comedy Zone. It was crazy. Those dudes that went up there were crazy. It may take a few months before I have the calibration and material to go up there but I'm going to go up there. I've thought about taking some acting classes here in town to gear up for it. I need to have some heckler defense jokes prepared and be able to sufficiently insult the audience as a whole. basically calling them dumb rednecks without just coming up and saying it. WHo set off the redneck bomb in here? Spare the horse, ride a cowboy? DO any of you know a horse or a cowboy? I don't think they make saddles for cowboys, you'd have to ride bareback. And then if this shit isn't enough, everybody goes over to Arizona Petes to blow off some steam country music line dancing and shit like that.What are some insulting things I can say to people in the audience? I can steal that one thing about when god made you he grabed the shaker for a dash of cunt, but the top fell off.Maybe something about, I know this isn't as exciting as the wal mart parking lot, but shut the fuck up./End rant

mdwe6	-20410	1321411976	AskReddit	Have any of you ever gotten fed up with your life and one day, without a plan, just walked away from it all and started something new? How did it turn out?	I'm about to that point. I don't have kids or pets so I'm sort of free in that way. I do have a job that many would see as "good" and other aspects of my life sort of look good on paper too. But the reality is that I have never been more miserable. I live this isolated life, even though there's people I go out with occasionally and I'm even dating this girl, somehow these people just aren't my tribe. It's weird. And the job, all it does is get me enough to get the shit I need to have a job like a car and an apartment and beers.I know it sounds silly, and I've been trying to explain it to those close to me, but I'm running out of time, time that I can continue to keep this shitty cycle going.I don't know what to do next, I don't have a plan but this shit is fucked. One day I'm going to wake up and I'm not going to be able to do it anymore. I mean I had so much more going on and loved life so much more when I was dirt poor. Now I've done college, had some long terms, had a dog for 12 yrs (she died several months ago), now I've got my new car and office job and I feel like the biggest loser ever.The way I see it, there are only two options: I keep doing what I'm doing or I do something else. The trouble is that I'm already on the edge of a nervous breakdown and I'm in no position to make a plan to smoothly transition out -- I'm just going to have to bail.

s1z29	-20410	1334028279	Psychonaut	Long, LSD trip report. I've always wanted to do one of these because I've enjoyed so many of yours. One of my more insightful experiences with Lucy.	I can already feel the details of my journey fading, so I wanted to take some time to document what I recall of a profound and intricate LSD trip I experienced over the weekend.I feel comfortable in saying that I’m a fairly experienced psychonaut. Now I’m in my mid-thirties and have regularly consumed psychedelics since I was a teenager. No doubt, I still enjoy dosing and goofing with friends at a concert or whatnot, but nowadays I am mostly into minimizing external stimulation so that I can turn the insightful powers of the substance toward deep introspection. In a way, I feel that LSD in particular has this ability to “overclock” the wetware of the mind, allowing the brain to process fantastic simulations and massive calculations.On this particular night, I was at a close friend’s birthday. As a celebration, we were having a cookout and enjoying some mild, sunny weather. I heard mention while at the cookout that there was some Lucy available and went ahead and bought 5 hits. The plan was to go out into town after dark and hit a few bars. I had considered taking a dose before going out, but decided to check the vibe first. While it wasn’t unpleasant at the bars, it was a bit boring so I decided not to eat any L, although some of our group did. At that point, I thought that I’d save the doses for another time.We ended up closing the bar down at 2am. I am not a vigorous drinker but did have a beer and a closing time shot of tequila. Before leaving, we decided to go back to the house where we had the cookout earlier to have a late night bonfire and maybe watch the sun come up.It was about 3am when we arrived back at the house. Again I didn’t think I would be dosing that night because many of my party had already done so and were coming off the trip. I had a joint on me and I fired it up with the birthday boy and the owners of the house we were chilling at. At that time birthday boy asked me if I was going to take any of the Lucy. I said “nah everybody’s coming down, it’s too late”. “I’m going to dose again,” he said. At that point I was all in. I ripped off three hits and chewed them like a piece of gum.Before getting into the actual trip, I feel it is important to mention that I had taken Lucy a handful of times over the past few months and had some great times, but had not gone into any advanced cosmic states. It seemed that the LSD generally available was what some might call “cocktail acid”. In other words, I would drift into the psychedelic spectrum, and but maintained a solid grip on ego and social functionality. The doses I took that night were not “cocktail acid”. I was tired. The night before I was up late playing with my band and hadn’t slept much, plus it was 3:30 am and I’d had a big, active day. I felt a little awkward socially because I didn’t know many people there, and I was stoned from the joint of bubble kush I’d just blazed. Giving up a bit on being social, I decided to plop down on a large leather chair in the living room and just relax for a few minutes.I am not positive if it was due to the L or just my body, but I suddenly felt quite cold, unpleasantly so and was concerned it may be a theme for the evening. It was then that I remembered I had a jacket in my car. I headed that way a grabbed my jacket. On the way back I saw some of the guys were working on building the bonfire. “I want in on this work group.” I said, knowing that hauling wood would warm me from the inside, and once the fire got going, it would be a source of external warmth.Once we got the fire tall and wide, I was quite warm, but with the warmth came fatigue. I wanted to be social as more people were arriving, but I was overcome with sleepiness. I was starting to feel the doses kicking in and reluctantly decided to go sit in my car for a few minutes of silent darkness to calibrate the trip.I got into my car, leaned back the seat and closed my eyes. It was at this point that I realized things were getting heavy. My first visions were of interlocking, glassy, nautilus-like structures. The visions were rapidly tessellating and increasing in complexity. To say they were “visions” is not completely accurate. It is more like the complexity and speed of the shapes were a representation of deep inner-workings of my mind. As I mentioned, I feel that LSD “overclocks” the brain and it was as if my mind’s processing cores were revving up before a race.In silent darkness, I was sharpening my introspection to a keen edge, using caution not to give in to astonishment. This was difficult as the thoughts and visions grew in intricacy  and scale. By this time, the brilliant, interlocking, glassy structures were revealing themselves to be a sort of inter-dimensional machine whose purpose was to pare down the essence of the Universe into the most absolute fundamental essence. I think of it as analogous to particle accelerators such as CERN who’s purpose is to reveal the most fundamental sub-particles in the physical world.As I gazed deeper and deeper into the mystical machinery, I developed a rough system of nomenclature to help myself understand the tool. It was a system of what I called combs, blades, baffles and mirrors. There was a sense that ultimate reality was a nearly impossibly elusive endeavor and the machinery had to move screamingly fast and grow in scale and complexity in pursuit of it. Fascinatingly, these combs, blades, baffles and mirrors would occasionally dig into a rough, unrefined segment of the reality matrix and the entire assembly would fly apart, flipping and spinning multi-dimensionally before pulling perfectly back together. While broken apart, the machinery exploded with data, delivering novel and exciting insights into the Universe.My admiration grew for the machines. They were perfectly exquisite, gleaming masses of aesthetics and functionality. As I became more infatuated and comfortable with the structures, I realized that all this was taking place in a sort of vast cosmic laboratory. What’s even crazier is that I was not alone. There were other explorers there as well using similar machines to examine reality.My colleagues all appeared to be gentlemen -- I say “gentlemen” and not “men” because they were incredibly well-appointed and polite, although I don’t recall any words being uttered. The gentlemen were very proud of their machines and openly showcased them to me. It is difficult to describe them in a non-psychedelic state, but I will try -- think of a cross between a Lamborghini, a particle accelerator and a Rubic’s Cube. There was a feeling that we were researcher-adventurers who frequented this space and worked in some sort of collaboration while still maintaining intense independence.Meanwhile the machines were still whirling away and truths were being revealed. I felt myself going far and deep into vast emptiness. I went so deep into the Black Ether that it is not longer accurate to say “I”. I lost myself. There was nothing, not even “me”, not even time. It could have been one minute, it could have been a billion years. All I can say is that it was not a desirable predicament. There was a horrifyingly immense pointlessness to what was going on.(See Comments for the rest)EDIT: I'll be on to answer your questions soon. I posted this before I went to bed and now I'm at the office. Promise I'm not ignoring you.

vere5	-20410	1340323881	AdamCarolla	Anyone else think DAG is an obnoxious not-at-all-funny prick?	I've tried to like DAG. Adam has him on pretty regularly and I've tried to get a taste for his "comedy" but this last at Carolines was the worst. He was a complete attention whore and was rude to Adam and Dave Attell. He interrupts and doesn't seem to understand that the appeal of a podcast is to have a somewhat regular, but funny, conversation. It's all about him when he's on there. That shit where he was talking about how Adam's audience wasn't Dave's audience was so stupid I couldn't bear to continue listening. His ongoing "joke" of being condescending toward Allison is anything but funny. He would interrupt Adam anytime he would build any momentum rant-wise. He is the death of funny in my opinion. I love Adam's podcast and I feel bad bitching about something that is free, but the podcasts with DAG are fucking awful. I don't understand why Adam likes him so much and I hope he annoyed him enough this time so that he won't be invited on again. It left such a bad taste in my mouth that I had to post this as an outlet for my disgust. Adam is the fucking man, Bald Bryan and Alison are the shit and most guests are great. But DAG is horrible.

2nicz8	-20453	1417033139	CrusaderKings	Question about de jure drift	So, I'm planning on forming the Empire of Britannia starting as one of the petty kings, maybe Wessex, for the challenge. I'm going to take its de jure territory, then expand to Britanny to get a foothold on the continent, so I can respond to pesky continental wars without having to assemble fleets. I will also take the duchy of Orkney from Norway, to deny them influence over the northern Atlantic, and because they're uncomfortably close to Scotland. Also I think it will look good on the map. So, after all that unnecessary info, my question is:Will the duchy of Orkney drift into my empire, or do I have to transfer its duke as a vassal to a potential king of Scotland, so it can drift to Scotland and become a de jure part of Britannia? The first option is the one that pleases me the most, since kings are annoying and I don't know if a viceroyalty would make it drift. Thanks in advance for any answers.
2nrcxf	-20453	1417272699	CrusaderKings	About republics	Let's say I start as a tribe in Scandinavia. I subjugate people and convert to a republic after some time. Do all my vassals convert to republics as well?I'm trying to create the Principality of Scandinavia, but I don't know if it will really work out as I wish. Do counties/duchies that are not coastal convert to republics? I'm trying to keep my realm free of feudal vassals. I can hold castles but it's unwise since characters with poor stewardship screw that up and force me to create feudal vassals. Will my vassal republics create feudal vassals? Does the republic limit apply here?
2odvnq	-20453	1417804274	CrusaderKings	Managing the Roman empire	I've recently started playing as the Byzantines. Started as the Basileus in 769, restored de jure borders, and organized my affairs internally. My vassals like me and my character is good. The time seems right for expansion.I want to restore the Roman empire to its de jure borders. Upon doing it, I'll have a huge empire to manage. So, I inevitably have to distribute kingdom titles, or at least viceroyalties. What kingdoms to you guys feel I should hand out, and how?For example, should I give out France and Aquitaine, or France and Hungary? On one hand, I get the problem of a compact front in case of rebellion, which means bigger stacks, and on the other I have to fight on multiple fronts, which are far from each other, meaning smaller stacks but more wasted time. Not to mention someone might feel opportunistic and invade me while I deal with my restless vassals. Should I hand out a handful of powerful kingdoms, or a lot of insignificant ones? Should I prioritise dynastic members? Should I just give out viceroyalties to content characters?Any answers are appreciated. Thanks in advance.
2p3lv3	-20453	1418408951	CrusaderKings	Does anyone else hesitate to destroy old dynasties?	I usually try my hardest to keep dynasties that have been with me since the start of the game alive. Even if they betray me, pull some faction crap on me, or are overall unhelpful, I still try to keep them alive. I do this because they survived the test of time alongside my dynasty, and I like my vassals to be of ancient lines. Other times, for example, when I have the Karlings at my mercy, I usually try to vassalize them, so their line carries on, albeit at a lower station. It just seems like a waste to destroy centuries of history and adventure that another family might have had for the sake of gold or easier ruling. Although I mercilessly destroy young Houses. 
2qnreo	-20453	1419810722	CrusaderKings	Restraining vassals	I have restored the Roman Empire, and I've hit the vassal limit. I kinda want to keep the borders I have right now, for purposes of administration, but my annoying vassals keep expanding beyond these borders, and people rarely attack them because they fear me. These guys are really driving me insane, they piss powerful foreign rulers off, they provoke other religions into holy war, and they make me deal with countless peasant/religious revolts. Additionaly, the territory they take is sometimes not contiguous, meaning I have to send troops to very inconvenient places when shit hits the fan.I am afraid of retracting their vassals because even though they are mostly powerless compared to me, angering a lot of them is dangerous, especially to my young ruler. Fortunately, most of them like me, and most of the land they've taken so far is contiguous, and I intended to take it later anyway, but things can and will get worse, since RNGesus hates my guts. Should I raise crown authority to absolute? I have the Augustus and the Born in the Purple traits, but I'm afraid that they'll be offended or something, and tear my empire apart from the inside. Can I do something else to rein them in?
2qvaex	-20453	1419985564	CrusaderKings	Longest peace time?	We all know that, when playing CK2, one can expect nearly constant warfare throughout the entire duration of the game. Claims, rebellions, holy wars, subjugations, you name it. Sometimes boredom triggers war. So, I ask you, what was the longest period of CONTINUOUS peace you ever had in one of your games? Personally, if it wasn't because of revolts, I'd have gotten to 30 years of continuous peace in my Francia game. Instead, I got 7 years. Vassals don't like being imprisoned. Not that I was inactive, I was just focusing on making the HRE fall apart through intrigue. The pen is mightier than the sword.
2r4c6k	-20453	1420222408	CrusaderKings	The saga of House Karling the Undying	So, I'm currently observing a game, and focused on watching the Karlings, to see if they would die out. Here's how the game played out so far...769, Charlie and Karloman are glaring at each other. Mommy Bertrada takes Charlie's side, as usual, and slaps Karloman on the hand for, well, not being Charlie. Some years go by, Muslims are approaching the Pyrenees, Karloman somehow killed Charlie along the way. He declares war on some unimportant Muslim Sheikh, thinking him a juicy morsel for his realm. The Ummayyads, who were fighting Asturias, sent a weak force just to tell him they were watching, but Karloman didn't care, and kept sieging. The Ummayyads didn't like that, promptly smashed Asturias against a wall, and came with a much larger force. Karloman fled, but was intercepted by the army of a Duke who had revolted. Karloman, unfortunately, won. It was a phyrric victory though, and Karloman promptly proposed peace to the U-Mads and the Sheikh of nowhere important after having some of his southern lands sieged.He lost prestige with this, which made his nobles like him even less. His mother starts a plot against him, and failed, courtesy of a drunk count. Karloman imprisons his mother, and executes her, gaining the Kinslayer trait. Now, he never was on good terms with Il Papa to begin with, but this was too much, apparently. The Pope excommunicates Karloman, and soon most of his nobles revolt. Then, Bavaria and Lombardy declare war, and, to my surprise, it looked like the end of House Karling's rule of the land. Nope. Karloman gets caught by Bavaria, peaces out with them, peaces out with the revolt, effectively making himself a king without power, and gets a chunk taken out of Burgundy by Lombardy. He dies a few years later, murdered by the young Duke of Aquitaine. His son ascends to the throne, miraculously survives until 16, and has a pretty uneventful reign until he reaches the age of 53. That's when he decided to imprison the Duke of Aquitaine, now an old man, for plotting to murder him. This guy really didn't like the Karlings. The imprisoning fails, and revolts, and most of the realm follows suit. Bavaria, ever the opportunist, declares war for some duchy in Burgundy. The Karling guy loses the revolt, loses prestige, and loses the duchy in Burgundy. That's when the Ummayyads strike. This was the last straw. The king dies from severe stress, and leaves his boy heir, Louis, on the throne. His regent promptly usurps his shit, and apparently it did some good for the realm, since he managed to beat the Ummayyads back. The boy and some family members flee to Lombardy (heh). It all seemed to be ending there. A bunch of people, most of them without claims, flee to some foreign court and are left to wither.I pinged them for interest, and left to watch some other areas. 20 years pass, Louis is a man now, most of the family is dead, stats are nothing too special, he has decent martial, and he's sitting in Lombardy. Welp, time to lay House Karling to sleep. Louis didn't think so. He becomes an adventurer, and what is he out for? England. Yes. Not his ancestral home of France, not Bavaria, just England. He easily beats down a war-weary England, that had been fighting the Scots for a piece of land, and crowns himself King. He gets an heir, dies, and the Karlings rule England for about a century, converting most of the population to Frankish. That's when they decide to invade their old realm of France, which ironically calls Bavaria into the fray. England gets defeated, the nobles get pissed off, revolt ensues to put some claimant on the throne. Karlings lose, flee to Hungary of all places, and start doing what they do best, which is surviving. One of them gets a title from the Hungarian queen, no doubt because he became her lover. The Karling duke rules for some time, and eventually dies, leaving his Hungarian heir to rule. He brings strife to the realm with endless plots and internal warfare, installs his wife on the throne, and a Karling heir rules Hungary after some decades. These people just won't die, they just hop around the map, although the Byzantines are nearby, and they're quite strong, after a rare instance of the Blobbasids collapsing.Edit: Finally got Paragraph tech researched. Lost 3 spymasters.
2rjc6f	-20453	1420568604	CrusaderKings	Have counts as direct vassals, is it worth it?	I'm playing Francia as the Karlings right now, I've conquered the de-jure land, everything is tidy internally, my dukes have only their de-jure land, and they don't have many counties themselves. I've also conquered 2 counties, mainly for good looking borders, but I've secured my mountain passes against the Muslims further, so it wasn't really a waste, since they invaded through one of the counties I took anyway.I currently have 2 counts directly beneath me, none of my dukes care since they're not part of any duchy in the realm. I've almost filled my vassal limit, and these 2 guys didn't help with that. Should I just transfer them over to nearby dukes, or do I keep them so I get more troops? My dukes are already powerful, I had to heighten CA to prevent some of them from gobbling up parts of the weak kingdoms around me, but while keeping the counts might be beneficial for defense, it's 2 more vassals to worry about. I don't really plan on expanding my realm, my current goal is indulging in incest and expanding my dynasty like the weeds they are. I might take Jerusalem once the Crusades activate, just for the Holy Orders.
2so0pj	-20453	1421441609	CrusaderKings	Has anyone managed to feudalize Britannia quickly?	I used to love playing as Wessex in the British Isles, and go up to form Britannia. I'd absorb my neighbors and form England, and from there on it'd usually be smooth sailing. England dominates the British Isles easily, provided you do things right. So I started a new game some days ago, formed England, and started fabricating claims on Wales. Everything went smoothly, my Chancellor forged some documents, and I quickly brought Wales into the fold. Being a tribal kingdom, it quickly became an annoyance. My vassals there hated me more often than not, and the land is dirt poor. No pun intended.Painstakingly, I took on a Scottish-Irish alliance in my effort to unite Britannia, having only England to rely upon for troops, since Wales is pretty much useless. I succeeded some generations later.Now, I do have an Empire, and Wales developed a bit, but I'm at a disadvantage against the Karlings, who managed to defend Brittany from an invasion of mine, despite their constant infighting. Scotland and Ireland are currently drains on my coffers. I've installed Anglo-Saxons everywhere, but they're still not of much use. Is there a way to feudalize these realms quickly? I could leave them to their own devices, but with the constant wars the Karlings declare on me, I need all the strength I can muster, and the way things are going, I'm probably going to get destroyed in the next war.

2ufg32	-20453	1422815368	CrusaderKings	Can viceroys destroy titles/lower CA in their kingdoms?	To further elaborate, can king-level viceroys destroy duchies? So far, whenever I need viceroys, I create viceroyal super dukes. This is because I'm afraid they'll destroy the duchy titles during their rule, and then I'll have to create them again. I'm also afraid they'll lower CA. Both of these contribute to internal border gore and chaos.This is especially troubling in large empires like the Roman Empire, because in some generations you'd have a mess so great it'd take a bunch of civil wars and purges to fix it.So, can I safely hand out kingdom viceroyalties, or do I keep using my system? I don't care about counts, but I want the higher ranked titles to stay inside their de jure borders and to have uniform CA.
2vnzus	-20453	1423759706	CrusaderKings	Any tips for a Mali playthrough?	I'm considering Mali for my next game, and I've never really played in the region. My objectives are to feudalize, reform my religion, and reach the maximum number of holdings. Basically an isolationism game where I try to improve myself and keep everyone else out. Any tips? So far, from what I've seen, I'll have to slowly work my way to Feudal while keeping angry Muslims at bay.It seems like a bad position to start in, since Gavelkind is all sorts of fucked, and Islam is a very powerful religion. An organized religion at that, any ground they gain on me needs to be taken back quickly, or the population embraces Islam and hinders my objectives even more.Furthermore, the whole region is very poor, it's the worst Empire in the game, with less than 100 holdings, and a very reduced number of duchies and provinces. I guess I can turn this to my advantage, since with less titles, I get less vassals, so I can centralize more, get more CA and basically tax everyone to space. But I can't do this until I have managed to get Mali unified, organized, and moderately rich.I've also seen that the West African religion gets a holy order when reformed, do they build new holdings like, for example, the Templars? That would be a huge incentive for me to feudalize and reform quickly, since it means Mali gets less dirt-poor.Any tips on how to make this work are appreciated.
2w0o9d	-20453	1424042530	CrusaderKings	Republic vassal question	I'm currently playing as Venice, just set myself free from the Byzantines after enjoying their protection for a few critical years. Currently the top power in the Mediterranean, with Orthodox religion and an excellent young ruler. I'm considering taking over the entire Italian peninsula and forming the empire of Italia, but I hesitate on this because of the "burgher vassal limit" feudal rulers have. Does this apply to me as well? Or do I have a "feudal vassal limit"? I want every count-level title and above to belong to a burgher (city vassal), but I'm not sure this is possible.
2yp2h8	-20453	1426093794	CrusaderKings	Is it worth it to hold more than one Empire?	I'm asking because I've conquered Hungary and Wallachia as Byzantium. Drifting them in might be a problem, but I can create the title of Carpathia. The prestige bonus for holding it would be nice, and I can set up inheritance laws so that things go smoothly and I don't have a civil war every generation, but would it be better to just let the kingdoms drift in? If so, why?

When I thought I had solved my problems, Email starts to drain my battery the next day.

1xxw23	-20466	1392421182	SSBPM	New Launcher Problems	My Wii has problems reading my brawl disc. It usually takes anywhere between 1-100 tries to get the disc to read the first time when starting brawl. This was fine in the previous launcher since it would just give me an error then I could go right back to the launcher menu to try again until it reads the disc.With the new launcher, I press start and if it doesn't read, it goes back to Wii Home. Then I have to try and get the disc to read again.I would love a solution to this problem that doesn't involve either a 400mb download or buying a Wii U (which I would like but can't afford). Any ideas?

I've recently made the mistake of buying an xbox one and as I've paid my £40 for a year of live, I might as well use it before I sell this thing for scrap. Been trying to play destiny, however working 50-60 hours a week means I pretty much just waste my precious little gaming time on 'the grind' plus I'm now getting an error message that nothing will fix, so fuck destiny!What games would you lot recommend? I do enjoy these first person shooters, but I also enjoy sandbox &amp; strategy games. I don't get much time free so I don't want something that's hard work, just a game I can play &amp; enjoy for a few hours a week &amp; see progress. Thanks!

There would have to be some kind of limit on how close the nearest boss is. Additionally, I'm not sure if there should be some kind of rule about these rounds not being able to pass through objects or not. It sounds reasonable at first, however it might not actually ever hit the boss. It would probably have to be play tested to find the right balance. Also, Pulse Rifle, Auto Rifle, or Hand Canon? There are reasons to place it on each. Which would be perfect for this and why?

2s8gr4	-20553	1421114698	DestinyTheGame	[Spoiler] House of Wolves May Have A Better Use For Loading Screens	I was ~~drooling~~ looking over the [graphic of the DLC included in the upcoming House of Wolves expansion](http://i.imgur.com/PBQFn20.jpg) and noticed something quite odd. I'm surprised no one has said anything about this yet, but I'm pretty sure we could see some other uses for our ~~loading screens~~ ships in the future, possibly combat. Did you guys notice the flavor text for some of the new ships? Let me give you some shining examples of why I think we're in for some much needed excitement.**JS/T Thoughtful But Abrubt**    &gt;Project Tendency custom tactical jumpship. ANDROIT TALON ship-to-ship combat payload.**JS/T Uncomfortable Silence**    &gt;Project Tendency custom tactical jumpship. Hardened Observatory and C3i asset.**JS/T Why, I Never**    &gt;Project Tendency custom tactical jumpship. Battlespace Dominance and surface bombardment.**JS/T Bicameral Friendship**    &gt;Project Tendency custom tactical jumpship. Blockade runner with augmented EWAR suite.**JS/T Key Facts Elided**    &gt;Project Tendency custom tactical jumpship. Heavy ASAT/ASM space attack loadout.**JS/T Let's Employ Force**    &gt;Project Tendency custom tactical jumpship. Battlespace dominance and network soft-kill capability.**JS/T Please Don't Be That Way**    &gt;Project Tendency custom tactical jumpship. Battlespace dominance and defense suppression.**JS/T Quietly Appalled**    &gt;Project Tendency custom tactical jumpship. Enhanced ISR/ELINT listening capability.It seems like the JS/T variety of ship is completely new and with very specific text describing combat capabilities. I could be chasing a dream, but considering new missions and raids taking place in the reef and asteroid belt, if there was a time to add ship combat, now would be the time.What do you think?

If he was an all-powerful being surly he could hide from us.However we can say the god of the bible does not exist. This is backed up by the old argument written by Epicurus around 341-270 B.C.EIs God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?This fully disproves the biblical God. But let’s not be rash god could exist. He could just be an entity that created the universe and just watches it progress with no interaction.Maybe he judges us but at no point interacts with us. This is why it is a stretch to say there is no god because the possibility of a god that leaves no proof exists. So to sum up a god or gods could exist, however the biblical god does not. The key here is that we shouldn’t make decisions based on the possibility that a god exists because we don’t know. So just live your life, have fun, and be a good person.

My client claims I can be sued for the work they would have gotten over the next year that they missed because of me missing my deadline. They are getting a $ value from the last year's income from the now lost customer.In reality my client never set a dead line but assume they did and assume I missed it. Do they have a case?**EDIT** Location : Canada**EDIT 2** Looks like I'm in the clear because no due date was on paper. Thanks for the input. That helped calm my nerves.

Over the summer break I got my chit together, started forgetting about her and ended up banging a few girls. I thought I was completely over this girl, until this week.Fast forward to present it ends up I have another class with this girl for the semester. I ended up catching up with her before class and she was acting all flirty like she did before she went cold last year, i could slowly start feeling those oneitis feels coming back, fark. Then in class she virtually nearly ignored for the whole time and sat with her friend.The feelings of angst, disappointment and anger started fueling me again, the feelings that made me a feel so chit last year, the feelings that controlled me were back.I cant deal with this for another semester, next class I'm going to be as sexually aggressive as I can be instead of tip toeing around like I had been. One last move to see if there is any attraction at all or if its just all games to her. If that fails I've met another girl who was in the same class so ill just move immediately on to her if attempt with oneitis fails to distract from oneitis.Does anyone here have any other alternatives that they think I should try? The regular advice of trying to ignore her and talk to other girls isn't going to work this time./rantCliffs:* Op developed feelings for girl at school last year* Things went cold with her before the deal was sealed* During summer break op believed he got over girl and smashed other girls* OP ends up having another class with girl from last year* Girl is back to being flirty but ends up ignoring op for rest of class* op gets frustrated beta oneitis feels again* op plans on making a one last bold move to see if girl is at all still interested* if that fails op has another girl he met in that class that seems interested to distract from oneitis if move doesnt work (99% chance it wont)

I started looking more towards finding a girl I click with but in the process of doing this I feel like I'm screening girls too hard and dismissing a lot of people and really having no fun or satisfaction.Right now I'm at a bit of a crossroads with what I want, In a way I feel like it is a bit of mental slump and it stopping my actual progress in finding a girl that I can have a connection with.
2tis20	-20590	1422116108	seduction	Lacking experience with girls but ego stops me from getting anywhere	Well first off I have to admit I am awful with girls, I know this is probably one of the first things not to admit to yourself if you want to be successful with girls but its the truth. Even though I don't get with girls I have regularly blown off girls who were interested in me but I was never interested in them back, and I feel the lack of experience with girls hurts my chances with the girls I am interested in.I feel like I'm in a bit a of rut here, I am obviously getting nowhere with girls I am attracted to due to lack of reference experiences and social skills but the girls that are interested in me I just feel nothing towards and struggle to force myself to do anything with them.If there is anyone who has gone through not having much experience with girls to having a lot of experience with girls what was your biggest step forward?
2tk73s	-20590	1422141759	seduction	I am an awful conversationalist, how do I improve?	I am very much stuck on square 1 when it comes to attracting women. Overall I am pretty terrible at holding one on one conversations, a lot of it stems from being introverted and getting extremely bored with small talk and a lack of experience. I feel that I feed into this mindset as well and it makes me feel even more awkward when talking with women. The only time I get a good flow when talking to women is when I'm drunk or get in state which isnt very often and I dont like the idea of having to be in a high emotional state every time I want to talk to girls as I feel a reliance on state shows that you have a lack of confidence in your baseline self.I feel that my job probably contributes to my problem as it is very mundane and there isn't much social interaction going on, I think this hurts when I go out on the weekend as I go from doing very little socializing during the week to a over stimulating, high energy environmentI'm not sure if the main thing that prevents me is the toxic mindset that I am not a good conversationalist or just a lack of experience with girls pushes me into my head when I'm talking to them. Anyway probably a bit of a rant but mostly just looking for advice from anyone who has been in similar circumstances and turned things around.

2z7l6r	-20590	1426490022	FIFA	What is so different from the old-gen compared to current-gen FIFA 15?	I use to play FIFA 15 on PS3 and was fairly solid at it making it all the way up to Division 1, but shit has changed dramatically on the PS4. I am getting absolutely dominated in Division 9 and it frustrating the hell out of me.My defenders will constantly be out of position and also allow players just to dribble straight pass them without even contesting, this is with Boateng and Sokratis the exact same defenders that got me into division 1 on PS3.Somehow though most opposing teams are able to send bullet like double teams at my players every time I get possession of the ball this wouldn't be a problem if my players could stop pass 1mph passes which keep getting easily intercepted.I have tried to dominate possesion and there are games where I have 60% of the ball with 80% passing accuracy and more shots on goal but still lose after Remy sprints pass my defenders on the counter.

Hamilton's rebounding stats are only in the 70's and Ajinca's defensive rebound stat is only 58. I decided to switch to Drummond (6'10) since his rebounding stats were both in the 90's but so far I would have to say both Hamilton and Ajinca rebounded a lot better.So the question is does height really factor in that much for rebounding in 2k15? If so Yao Ming looks like a beast at 7'6 with 90 rated rebounding stats

Played this guy online just then who kept running this play where it was a double screen on one side of the 3 point line and would dribble back towards the middle of the 3pt line to drive with mostly a free lane to the basket. I tried combating it by bringing the center up to hard hedge on the point guard just as he comes around the 2nd screen, if the hedge wasn't that good it would leave the opposing center under the basket alone, but no big problem. The next cheese with this play was even if I did a good hedge with the center, my sf or sg would without fail leave their player alone in the corner to try and help defend the drive by the pg even though I have it handled with the center. I started getting a bit more success when I doubled the pg straight away when he initiated the play but it still left players open here and there.So are there any settings you can use to stop players helping off their players so much? I made sure in the defensive settings that all the wing players where defended tightly off the ball. Would lowering the defensive assist strength in the controller settings help? Also does anyone know the name of the play and what playbook its from? 
371j4d	-20590	1432426484	MadMax	I think my theater may have ruined my viewing experience	As soon as the movie started something about the movie felt really off for me, the frame rate had a really jarring, jerky near disorientating feel to it. I asked my friend next to me if he felt there was something "off" about the movie and he felt the same way too. At some stages it felt like the movie was running at 10 fps and then sometimes at an extremely high frame rate, I remember distinctively at the start of the film when Max is being chased on foot by the war boys and he jumps towards the crane hook there was a frame jump from him standing on the platform to then hanging of the crane hook. It seemed to of improved during the last half of the film but it was severely cutting into my viewing pleasure as it was taking me out of the film.I did some research into it after and apparently Miller did play around with the frame rate in the film a bit so I thought that was the reason for it but I was still suspicious that my theater may of had something to do with. I ended up watching a dodgy cam stream online just to see if there was a difference and low and behold the cam version was no where near as problematic with the frame rate.So I was just wondering did anything else feel that the frame rate was "off" during their experience watching it at the theater?

3fczoa	-20590	1438391691	seduction	Struggling to get my head around Alex's 'you are enough' concept	For all of you who haven't watched the video here is the link (warning it's long)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3-EpyOrjBkOk so after watching Alex's video on there being 'no reason why you aren't enough' a lot of it interested me and a lot of the concepts I related to. I feel like I can greatly relate to his idea of ego vs self esteem where ego means external validation pumping up your value and self esteem comes from within. Alex explains ego isn't where you want to base your identity since the ego can be extremely fragile and can fluctuate constantly (another thing I relate to strongly). You can go from thinking you are the shit to next day thinking lowly of yourself and questioning your identity.Alex mostly wants guys to base there identity around strong self esteem, and this is where I struggle to buy into the concept. It is not an easy concept for anyone to buy into and believe they are of value of anyone. Completely consciously forgetting all things such as looks, status, wealth and just believing you are of value when you approach someone and never questioning it even when you get knocked back repeatedly. I think I'm probably an extremely logical guy so I struggle to believe you can just be of value inherently. (it seems most good pick up artists have incredible self esteem and never flinch when there value is brought into question)I really want this concept to click into my belief system since I'm tired of having a weak identity built around an ego that fluctuates all the time but I'm just struggling to wrap my head around never questioning your value and just believing you are enough. Maybe someone can frame it a different way so it kinda clicks a bit better?

h2srl	-20593	1304389818	appstate	Appstate reddit meetup ideas?	Hey everyone. We've tossed around the idea of a meetup in the past but we never really were able to coordinate one. I think it would be really, really cool if we did this, but we need to brainstorm a bit. The main thing is coming up with a place to meet. Bars are a problem because some of us are under 21 and aren't allowed in after 10 (that said, I'd personally be cool with gaining some reddit drinking buddies, but I digress). Restaurants are ok, but some redditors, like me at the end of the pay period, may be too poor to pay for food, and also if there are a lot of us (hopefully there will be!), we may not all fit.So, what do you guys think? I think this is a perfect time of year to do it because school is basically over and summer sessions haven't started yet. I mean, it could be as simple as us just meeting up on Sanford Mall for a picnic or something, although I feel like we can be more creative than that.I am willing to do any grunt work that needs to be done...coordinating, making a reservation, decorating, dressing as the reddit alien, whatever needs to be done. Just let me know some of your ideas!Edit: Just some extra info...I have actually graduated and have a job, so I don't have the summer off, but I am free usually every weekday evening after 7 and Saturday and Sundays after 4. So I can do this pretty much any day of the week.

There may have been a couple of installments but it wasn't a running series or anything, as far as I know. Basically, the comedian was in a real-life college-looking classroom with real people, and he talked about interesting bits of history with the help of Powerpoints and demonstrations. He's really funny but it's also very informative. I specifically remember there being a section about Hedy Lamarr inventing frequency hopping. He also presented a series of product mascots and explained which ones were based on real people and which were not - Aunt Jemima, Betty Crocker, and Chef Boyardee are a few that were mentioned. I want to say the host's name was Robert something.I tried to be as specific as I could. Even with all the details I remember, for some reason neither I nor my boyfriend could find what the hell it was, even after some serious Googling.

I read a book when I was young, probably 10 or so, about a young girl named Nora who described herself as "clairvoyant" throughout the story. I know a big part of her "abilities" was that she could see auras on people, trees, dogs, etc. and was able to use this skill to judge others' intentions and attitudes. I feel like the main storyline was that her mother had passed away and she was now under the care of one or more of her brothers who were both several years older than she was and did not share her abilities. The book was about her dealing with the loss of her mom while also dealing with being a weirdo who could see people's auras. I don't think she could see dead people, but I feel like she maybe could hear others' thoughts. She had something going on other than the aura thing. I remember one scene where she is in the kitchen with her brother(s), begins to cry, and the brother hops up from his chair to come hug her and knocks the chair over in the process. I do not know why this scene sticks out to me. I believe Nora was described as being about 12 or 13, having brown hair, and being small for her age.The book itself, as I remember it, had a sky-blue jacket with the title of the book on the front, as well as a landscape showing some green hills and trees (think watercolor style). I believe there was a rainbow in the sky. I'm sorry I can't offer more detail but I think that was pretty much it.I would have read this book around 1996-1998, but I am not sure when it was written. It was set in pretty modern times though so I'm guessing maybe 1980s.I know this is kind of a long shot, but like I said, it has been bugging me for a very long time and the Google has been unable to help me despite numerous attempts over the years.

37z214	-20593	1433090809	childfree	Neighborhood children: get off my lawn and dog	So, my husband and I live in a large apartment complex, and there are what seems like thousands of children living here as well. Literally five or six schoolbuses come to drop kids off every afternoon and clog up the workings of the universe. Our row of apartments (I think there are 8) in particular house numerous children. Probably 14 or 15 kids total. Now that it is warm outside, they are constantly running around outside, yelling, screaming, riding their skateboards at Mach 3 down the sidewalk, etc. Surprisingly, this has never been a huge deal to me because I can just close my door and they typically scatter if I go outside and give them a stink eye.HOWEVER. We've developed a problem. We have three dogs - a yellow lab (Roxy), a boxer/pit mix (Stella), and a Pomeranian (Yoshi). A girl who lives a couple doors down have developed an obsession with Yoshi. It has gotten to the point now that each time we take Yoshi out for a walk, this child will run at us, screaming "YOOOSHIIIIII!!!!" She's probably around 6 years old. Honestly seems like a sweet kid, but it is out of hand. I swear she literally hides in wait on her porch for hours on end just so she can know the exact moment we are bringing Yoshi outside. Last week, my husband took the dogs out while I stayed inside. Of course, the girl freaks out over Yoshi immediately, petting, squeezing, squealing, etc. My husband puts Yoshi back inside to escape, but neglects to close the door, so all that's between me and the sprog is the glass storm door. I come out of the kitchen to see her with her face and hands pressed against the glass, *looking into my apartment*, squealing "YOSHI! YOSHI! YOSHI!" over and over. She makes eye contact and clearly expects me to open the door and let her play with Yoshi. Instead I ignored her and she eventually went away. Never once have I seen this child's parents, but she is always outside, trying to get into strangers' apartments. I mean, as annoying as she is I would never hurt a child, but what if we weren't nice people? What if we were weirdos? It's a chilling thought but it would be easy for someone to manipulate a child when their parents are clearly providing 0 supervision. It's annoying and it's dangerous.Anyway, I know I've gone on a bit of a rant but this has been bugging me for a couple of months now and I needed to let it out. It annoys my husband too but he is too sweet of a man to complain much so I don't get much support from him when I get annoyed about it. Thanks for listening!

3h21mx	-20593	1439607019	childfree	Money problems? Have no fear! Just get knocked up with a Meal Ticket™.	Y'ALL. I had a moment at work today. I supervise a program for adults with disabilities and we operate several group homes. I was doing a site visit today and got to talking with one of the staff. She's rather new so I don't know her well but she seems like a really good girl. I said something about my husband, which obviously is a cue for people to assume it's fine to ask about our plans to have unprotected sex. Of course, I said that we don't want kids. "You'll change your mind when it happens...once you're pregnant you'll be happy...I had a friend who never wanted kids and now she has 2 and loves them..." blah fucking blah. Standard shit. But then, I mentioned children being expensive. She starts going on and on about how kids really aren't that expensive because government benefits will pay for everything if you don't have a job (she was not working for our company when she had her baby). I shit you not. She began listing all the things that were free for her because she had Medicaid - the entire birth was apparently free, formula, doctor visits for mom and baby, WIC, food stamps, shots, etc. She literally said, "Don't you know you get a tax credit when you have a baby? When I do my taxes next year I'm going to get $4000 back for my baby!" I must have looked at her like she was a fucking alien because she then said, "What? Who doesn't want a free $4000? That's a good reason to have one right there!" I then laughed incredulously and she stared at me with the most serious goddamn face. Seriously. She continued, saying "And once you have your baby, people will fall in love with it and will want to just buy you stuff for it. Your parents will eat their grandbaby up! You'll never have to pay for anything. That plus the government benefits, you're set for life."Things were a little awkward after that. Like, this isn't even a post about an asshole kid, but it seems to me that this kid has an increased chance of growing up to be a dick if he's got a mom with this kind of attitude. Tl;dr Leech mom bingoes me, advises me to get knocked up and live off the government's teat because fuck personal responsibility.

dw3py	-20605	1288020185	linux	Computer freezes sometimes when trying to boot up	Hi, I have a laptop and I have a weird problem. I think it's a hardware problem, so I would like to know what do you think about it.I have Ubuntu 10.10 beta installed and Windows 7. When I turn on the computer and GRUB (a beta version, but it shouldn't matter) loads, sometimes (not always) if I make time the computer freezes and I have to restart. The problem is that when this happens I may want to boot into Windows 7, but the computer freezes before loading it. This never happens with Ubuntu.The problem shouldn't be with GRUB, because when I select Windows 7, it appears a menu asking me if I want to boot up normally, without internet, ... as it failed last time. And if I make time, the computer also freezes.My idea is that there may be some piece of hardware working bad in the laptop that is only used when booting up and since Ubuntu boots up quite faster than Windows it never stops.Do you have any idea?**TL;DR:** My laptop sometimes freezes before loading an Operating System. Ubuntu always work, Windows sometimes not (as the computer froze before loading it).

Instead of an 'e' it shows a block. See the pic: http://i.imgur.com/nG8Sr.pngIf I change the font (for example to Sans) the problem is solved, but after some time it happens again with other(s) letter(s) (not 'e'), for example ':', pic: http://i.imgur.com/yVVof.pngIf I change back to the font that was before and showed bad the 'e' (Ubuntu) the problem is now again with the letter 'e' again.What the fuck is this and how do I solve it?Tl;DR: After some time ON Ubuntu starts showing bad some letters.

ef78m	-20605	1291321723	Physics	How do you write * (multiplication symbol)?	Hi, in my country we usually separate decimals with commas, so, for example:9.78 = 9,78 = 9'78We don't usually separate thousands, but when we want, we do this way:875,256,898.27 = 875.256.898,27 = 875.256.898'27The problem I have found with the way you write numbers in America is that you can understand a dot when is a multiplication.For example, I would write:8·2,5 or 8·2'5 -&gt; no problem.But if you write 8·2.5 it may be confussing most of the times if you write fast. So, I was wondering if you may not use · for multiplication, you may just leave spaces8 2.5or use always ()8(2.5)When I was a wid we used x, but x is no longer an option since x is usally used as a variable.**TL;DR:** How dou you write the multiplication symbol when writting?

k3jqq	-20605	1315062719	pics	How to solve the problem with attribution	Hi, people wanna submit a comic or something and instead of linking to the original page they upload the image to imgur. The problem with linking the original is that you may DDOS it accidentally.What I propose is to create a website that tries to access the original page, but if it's down it should display the image uploaded to imgur. You'd enter to this website and post the link to the comic. The website should automatically detect the image of the comic, upload it to imgur and give you an address to post in Reddit. When you enter this address from Reddit you should see the original comic but if the website is down you should see the comic that was uploaded to imgur. You could put ads but only when this happens.I could code this but I don't think I could host it, since it may require a lot of bandwidth.What do you think, guys?

Hello Reddit,I would like to start off saying I feel guilty coming to this, but I know this community is great and thought I would give it a try. So here we go:About 4 years ago, I met one of my now best friends (she is from Poland) on a chatroom and we became instant friends. We soon became pen pals and have kept in contact ever since. She is an awesome person; there is no doubt about that.Both of us would finally like to meet in person. However, being a college kid who is paying bills for an apartment and school...money is a little tight.So I guess here is where some of you can come in if interested. I recently signed up for Delta SkyMiles and noticed a section that other members can donate/transfer miles to other members if they have the Member ID number.With these miles, I can get discounted tickets which would help me and my wallet!Even if you donate 5 Miles, it is greatly appreciated. Reasonably I would like to pay out of pocket around $400-$500. Which means I would need around 130,000 Delta SkyMiles to be donated.If you are a Delta SkyMiles member and want to help me out: you can donate to Member #9160268315. Thanks in advance!By the way, the name is Zachary! Nice to meet you all!Like I said, any and all would help.Help me visit my best friend!!TL;DR: Met girl from Poland (I am American), want to finally meet her after 4 years of being pen pals; being poor college kid I can't afford the entire ticket; looking for donations from other Delta SkyMiles members

Credit to u/sscspagftphbpdh17 for giving me the idea for this post idea.But I am interested to hear how my fellow yids started following Spurs football? My story is a little embarrassing but it follows creed #9: You don't pick the team, the team picks you:My first year at university a friend of mine got FIFA 12 so naturally everyone hung out there to try it out. I will be honest that I was never a huge fan of football until the 2010 World Cup and had never played FIFA until the instance in which this story is about. So my friend and I started playing and he told me to pick a team. Knowing literally nothing about football, I flicked down the EPL teams and saw Tottenham; and something clicked inside me and told me to pick them. That weekend I went 4-0 while playing with my Spurs. Fell in love with them instantly and have followed them ever since. Looked up everything I could about the team history. Been a proud fan ever since 2011. So...what is your story? **TL;DR**: Didn't know much about football (American here), friend at University got FIFA 12, chose Tottenham because of a guy feeling, went 4-0 that weekend, fell in love.

A little about me: I am a Granite Stater, born and bred; love this state. I am currently attending Keene State College and will be graduating this May to start a career in IT in Portsmouth. I will be moving to Newmarket and have begun to seriously consider running for NH Rep. Some quick points about some of my beliefs: * Create incentives for 21st century technology firms to open and employ our residents. Let's make our National Leading low Unemployment even lower. * Lets make NH Green - renewable energy, cut coal, etc. * Legalize and tax marijuana. This is a way to bring in MUCH needed revenue for the state without creating a tax burden on the entire populace. * Find a way to drive the costs of university for in-state tuition down to keep the educated Granite Staters in New Hampshire. Stop the Exodus of Educated Youth. Put more money into USNH, cut costs, etc. * Cut costs in the state budget where they can be afforded. * Serious debate on the minimum wage. I do believe in an increase in the minimum wage: debate would be on how to implement this without hurting businesses, etc.Ask me anything !EDIT: Added some quick personal belief points.

2vg3md	-20622	1423595632	Amtrak	Honest critique needed	Hey fellow RailHeads.   So for the past year or so, I have had a somewhat obsession with public transport, especially rail, ever since I returned from a trip abroad in Europe. I have known for a while that America is so far behind in this type of infrastructure.   I have used Amtrak a lot recently (Downeaster) and have been reading a lot about their expansion plans, etc. Which got me thinking on how they could make it better, faster, and catch up/exceed the world in HSR.   Long story short, I have been doing a lot of research and came up with a plan that I haven't seen proposed before: use the highway system to our advantage.  The Interstate highway system could be used for its straight paths, flat lands, and unused space. I have attached two photos. The first is a picture of a highway where the highlighted section are the two tracks (inbound/outbound). The second picture is a proposal on how to update high ways that don't have that type of space between lanes already. The picture can be found [here](http://imgur.com/a/ElH3o).  I have been looking on cost, and I have yet to find much evidence to back this statement up, but there is a part of me that believes laying new track all together could be more cost effective than taking up old and putting down new.   What is your honest critique on this?

Would you suggest living outside of Belfast and coming in for work?   Basically any information is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance, guys.

My thinking behind this would be that the land that would be needed to create an city connection is already there in the form of the large swaths of land that is in between the lanes of high way. Currently, it is just non-utilized space. I found out about a plan that would [connect Los Angeles to Las Vegas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transrapid#Los_Angeles_to_Las_Vegas) using a monorail system.  Would the economics of creating monorail make since?

I love Skyrim for how big it is, room for role playing, and the random dragon attacks.So here is what I've played:Oblivion-loved the mechanicsFallout 3- VATS was a very cool featureDragon Age: Origins- I liked the option for romanceThanks for checking this out, I really appreciate it!

The game doesn't have to be based on an anime but I thought it would be a good base for what I'm interested in. Sword or hand to hand combat is preferred, I'm not a fan of guns but if the game is fun overall perhaps I'll give it a try. Thanks! edit: I have a ps3 and PC
1yf235	-20645	1392874826	UCSC	A potential students questions	Hello, I want to start out by saying UCSC is my dream school not really for academics but for how beautiful it is up there (I'm from SoCal). Regardless I am still concerned with some aspects about the school and would really appreciate any of my questions being answered:1) How is the bio major? Are the professors good?2) If I want to hit the bike trails do I need an expensive bike? Any recommendations for what I should get?3) What is the gaming community like? I'm not serious but I do enjoy Starcraft, Skyrim, and assortments of other games.4) How difficult is it to get into the orchestra and what is the quality of it?5) How safe does the campus and public transport feel, will I be safe using it at night?6) What do you like or not like about UCSC, anything random that I should know?7) Fun things to do in Santa Cruz8) How hard is it to get to San Fran without a car? Can it be done with public transport?Thanks again for taking the time to read this, just a side note I'm not interested in partying/drugs/alcohol in case that is a concern for any answers. 
2070op	-20645	1394590523	skyrim	Sauron in Blackreach?	I'm pretty positive that this isn't part of the game so I am wondering what mod it might be. He's located right under the "sun" you can shout at to fight a dragon and he has a group of enslaved people. The only mod related to LOTR that I have is the weapons pack. Its not that I didn't like the surprise of running into Sauron when I was in Blackreach but I'm curious where it could be from. Thanks.

In case it affects the answer I am planning on going to Crown for the nerdy community and don't plan on using anything "recreational". Thanks a bunch!

23kcmk	-20645	1398052596	AskReddit	Was college worth the debt you accrued?	I'm about to pick a college and a large factor is a fun and higher cost school vs an not fun and practically free one. The difference in price here is about 40k, so as many of you are going through the same thing or have already been through it, is it worth the debt to go to a college that fits you better but to be in greater debt?Edit: The more expensive college is also better for my degree but I have to go to graduate school afterward regardless of which college.

28j4t6	-20645	1403159331	MTB	Would it look bad if I wore full gear?	Hi, I want to wear full protective gear for a multitude of reasons. One, I am relatively new to mountain biking and want to get into it fast with less fear of injuring myself. Two, I want to conceal my gender so I feel safer on the trails. Three, I think it looks cool! When I say full protective gear I mean a full-faced helmet, goggles, chest, butt, arm, leg, glove, and wrist protection (or at least full-faced helmet). My concerns are the price and how I will appear to other bikers. The trails I ride aren't very intense to entirely justify it for safety alone and most everyone else riding has no protection other than a regular helmet (but they have really nice bikes). Thanks for reading this and your input. (If this should be posted in /mtbot please tell me and I'll relocate it!)

Could anyone please give me some advice on when to show up in order to get a decent seat and the way it works to go to a panel outside of the convention center? Would the line be inside or outside a place that requires a badge (I ask because I have some friends without badges who I am hanging out with that day and I DO NOT plan on sneaking them in) Any information at all will be helpful because I really do not want to miss this panel.

2bfxpw	-20645	1406070685	Pepakura	Please help me with a helmet catastrophe!	I made a Loki helmet and I used fiberglass resin on it but as I did that it began to fall apart in higher stress parts of the helmet(the horns mostly), I don't think I added enough oxidizer to the resin so it took forever to dry and more of it fell apart. Its malleable enough for me to glue it back together but I don't know what glue to use. If anyone could tell me an adhesive that would get the job done I would be forever grateful. Thanks.

Answers are typically personal gripes or praises about each company with seemingly little knowledge of *why* some of these experiences happen on the company side. Are they really indifferent to equipment problems or is it simply bureaucratic inefficiency?Our classroom has recruitment posters for Wener, Knight, Averitt, Crete, Hunt, Shaffer, Shneider, and Swift.

After 18 years, most of my life, in Albuquerque, I'm leaving for Dallas where I have a greater income opportunity. I've been working as a level 3 security guard for a year with one company. They have been very flexible with me through family medical problems, sick days, and school as long as I've been willing to work as needed for them. I'd like to help my boss replace me in the next 2-3 weeks. If you have a level 2 or 3 guard card, let me know and I'll connect you.

I'd hope that some merciful soul is nearby and willing to tell me what I can go do or, if I'm lucky, someone wants to do something.

There are 50 to collect in total. The catch is that you can't choose which collectable you get - you just get a foil bag with a random collectable inside.

2g1ftq	-20666	1410381797	newzealand	I was one of the 100 undecided voters that used the TV3 app last night during the leaders debate. I keep hearing it was a "draw", but based on the live results I could see there was a clear winner.	As the title says, I was one of the 100 undecided voters that used the TV3 app last night during the leaders debate. The app required us to tap "agree" or "disagree" in real time as the leaders spoke. The app was a [dial interface]( http://i.imgur.com/tPGN6cN.jpg) - and in real time it would turn either to the agree or disagree depending on the combined tapping. Now, aside from a single mention by Paul Henry in the post show analysis, no one seems to be taking about the results. And even Henry only mentored the positive response to Cunliffe's "I'll feed the children" speech. But here's the thing. Based on the reactions I saw in real tine, Cunliffe won that debate. Hands down. Key got a few positive reactions, usually when talking about pulling through the GFC etc. But by and large, when Key spoke the dial spun to the left hovering in the "disagree zone" and when Cunliffe spoke it was hard up on the "agree" side. So, rather than getting all these "pundints" to debate how close of a draw it was, why doesn't TV3 just release the reaction information?

It's funny to think that when Orwell wrote the book 1984 he imagined a future where every citizen was under constant surveillance from the government. In the year 1984 the world rejoiced that we did not live in this dystopian future! But 30 years later we now find out that we were closer to Oswell's predication that we ever thought.

But no mention of, say, Xkeyscores, NSA bases, TTA, Five Eyes or any other revelation. After his 5 minute lampooning of KDC we then got story about the NSA base which showed Key denying it. End of story. ~~But hang on. Edward Snowden - an internationally recognised whistle-blower - claims to have personally riffled through NZ mass surveillance metadata.

2jb4py	-20666	1413372884	Sonsofanarchy	[Spoilers] My theory on next week's episode.	Rewatching the [promo](http://youtu.be/7482SFSel2o) a few times, I've picked up:* Jax is apologising to the club for the vengence* The black &amp; white shots are flashbacks. * Unser is talking to Jax about a "her" * Juice is in his kutte, on a bike, shooting at cop motorcycles. * Juice is running from a police pursuit. * Jax hands Juice his kutte back at the site of his father's death (initials carved into rock behind him). So... He's what I reckon is going to happen. First, Jax doesn't kill Juice. Instead, Juice confesses to Jax about his involvement with Tara's death and the cover up. I say this because of the time delay. The last shot of tonight's episode sees them leading him out at night, but he's getting his kutte back in the morning. A kutte he later wears on a suicide run. That's my second prediction: Even with the confession, the club aren't forgiving Juice. He killed another club member to cover up his narking. He betrayed the club to Nero. He was trying to sell them out to the Myans. And he was an accessory to Tara's murder. No... He's dead. But Jax let's him "redeem" himself with a suicide / death by cop scenario. Why? The cop in hospital tells Unser the Sons were at the shooting. That and the gang war they're involved in, and the pressure the sheriff is getting from the DA... They need a scapegoat. Enter Juice. He's gone rogue, he's on the run, there's an ABP out in him. He's the perfect fall guy. So Juice chooses death by cop + takes responsibility for recent crimes (pinable on the Sons) as a final act of redemption. Oh, and Jax knows about Gemma, but doesn't act this episode. However he now realises his mistake hence the table apology. That's my prediction - what are yours? **REVISED THEORY****EDIT: A few people have pointed out that Jax negotiated with Tully to get access to Lin in prison. So I think it is more likely now that Juice isn't doing a suicide run, he's getting himself arrested so he can go inside to take down Lin. This also means he doesn't tell Jax about Gemma just yet. I reckon that's going to come from either Unser, Wendy or.... Nero.**

2nwe5l	-20666	1417399956	newzealand	Has anyone had any experience with Turners Car Auctions and the Consumer Guarantees Act?	So I won't go into too much details, but long story short, I bought a car through Turners Car Auctions 4 weeks ago, and I have just been told it now needs major transmission repairs worth ~$2-3k. I had a look on their website, and they say they are only liable for cars they sell on behalf of registered traders. And I do believe my car was a private vendor. Having said that, I still have all the paperwork they displayed in the car, including the Consumer Information Notice, which only lists Turners Car Auctions as the registered seller - not that it's a private sale, or the name of the ex-owner. So, my question is, has anyone here had experience or know anyone who has tried to get Turners to repair faulty cars? I haven't spoken to Turners yet, as I need the mechanics report first, but I just want to be armed with as much advice and information as I can when I go in there. *Note: Yes I have spoken to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs who say that despite their claims, they are liable.*

But, the role has now become a very political position. With Fyfe's histroy at Air NZ (turning it around financially, and leading it to winning Airline of the year), as well as his public profile, I reckon he'll be on the list.

2tc8lv	-20666	1421966962	newzealand	Is a rail system a possible solution to Auckland's inflating house prices?	I was thinking about this the other day. If the government was to invest in a commuter rail service that linked Auckland to Tauranga (via Hamilton) with stops along the way, then it would open up so much more potential for people to live out of the city and work in Auckland's CBD. The route is 230km one way, but commuter trains can operated at up to 200kph. Let's say 150kph for safety, so that's around 90mins. Now let's add in say 6x 5min stops along the way (at stations all along that route). So a passenger could potentially catch the train in Tauranga at 6:15am and be in Auckland's CBD at 8:15am. Someone living in Huntly could be at work in 37minutes. That's faster than I can get to work living on the North Shore. I'm not saying this will fix everything, and will obviously take time and significant investment - but suddenly it wouldn't be out of the question to live hundreds of kms out of Auckland and still communte there every day for work. **Edit: So it appears I am far from the first person to think of this, and someone has even gone to the effort of [figuring out which trains to use](http://transportblog.co.nz/2014/05/14/another-look-at-intercity-rail/), and even create a timetable! Looks like I was a little off, which a trip from Tauranga to Auckland being more like 3hrs.** * Station Map: http://i.imgur.com/lNh3eyG.png* Timetable: http://i.imgur.com/k8EYQ04.jpg

2vdh39	-20666	1423535781	nosleep	So the local theater around the corner from my house just confirmed my childhood ghost experience with video footage.	So, bit of a back story: As far back as I can remember there have always been stories about [the theater down the road](https://goo.gl/maps/BF5Xc). It's actually the old pumphouse, that used to pump water to the local community at the turn of last century. As the story goes, one of the workers was trying to clean the pump, but something went wrong and he was sucked into the inner workings. So, fast forward until I'm about 15 or so, and me and some mates went down there one night to prove our manliness in the face of these local ghosts. We decided to play a game of Who Can Sit By Themselves The Longest. So, being all cocky and shit, I went first. So there I am, sitting by myself on the seats / stairs of the amphitheater, when I started hearing a creaking noise. Figuring it was just my mates trying to scare me, I yelled out, as you do, that I wasn't falling for it. A minute or two goes by of silence, then the creaking comes back. Again, I yell out that I'm not falling for it, but this time I get a reply. From my mates. About 20 meters in the other direction. So as I'm sitting there, the realization that friends are not making these noises, the door to the stage suddenly, and inexplicably, opens. I didn't stick around to find out who (or what) opened it. Fast forward to today - I log in to Facebook and see that a friend of mine has liked a video that very same theater has just posted on Youtube. Here it is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YqmnInge3o

So I couldn't rationalise why the trains kept breaking the rules, disobeying direct orders, and causing daily accidents if they all had drivers. Then it hit me, the trains aren't 'alive' - each train is driven by someone suffering from a mental disorder that makes them believe they ARE a train. Sodor, the Island they live on, is actually a giant asylum where these individuals get to live out their delusions in relative safety, while also performing a service. It explains so many things:• Primarily why these apparently self aware trains require drivers in the first place. • But also, why these drivers don't stop the trains from doing so many dangerous activities. E.g. Ramming the trucks, taking shortcuts, racing other trains, purposely derailing other trains... In fact just watch any episode to see an example of a driver wilfully letting his train do whatever it wants, despite the danger.  • The fat controller is the asylum's primary caregiver. • The passengers are all family and friends. TL;DR - Thomas isn't a tank engine, he's a delusional driver called Thomas.

A close family friend was recently diagnosed with Stage IV GM after suffering a stroke. Doctors were able to remove a significant portion of the tumor, but a small bit remains tethered to his occipital lobe. He is now struggling with a post-operative infection and very low morale while his family does their best to care for him amid the heartbreak. They are desperate to gain perspective on what road lies ahead, but live outside the US without good access to quality support, so I was hoping that the reddit cancer community might be able to offer insight. Really, anything about the experience:* Personal prognosis/disease progression* Being a caregiver* Good ways of coping* Diet recommendationsAdditionally, any online resources you have found especially helpful would be greatly appreciated.Thanks reddit.

But there is something perverse about our culture of praising individuals for showing empathy toward the citizens whom we allow to remain in anguish and poverty. What example of empathy is he really setting for us if we cannot see that this woman is suffering because our society has failed her? How can a story like hers *warm* our hearts? No one deserves to be in such a place of desperation, and yet the conversation is not about addressing the unmet needs of countless people in our society, it is about the heroism of a person who can bring a woman to tears with $150.
38if61	-20674	1433421822	TwoXChromosomes	Thoughts on our current dialogue about sexual assault	Innocent until proven guilty. This is an argument I hear all the time from the camp of people highly skeptical of sexual assault accusations. And it is absolutely true that we should give the accused the benefit of the doubt until a fair process determines if this accusation can be substantiated beyond a reasonable doubt. But this brings up two enormous issues that go unaddressed:1) this benefit of the doubt should therefore also extend to accusers -- we should treat them as if they are telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth -- and treat the case as a real threat, just as a building is evacuated when there is a bomb threat2) how do we identify and bring perpetuators of sexual assault to justice? We know there are many, but by and large these people remain unidentified with blood on their hands and able to reoffend, while victims remain silent.The fact of the matter is, in reality there are clear cut cases of sexual assault and then there are the vast majority, which do not have witnesses or hard evidence. I think we need a national dialogue about how to achieve the ends of supporting victims and lowering the incidence of sexual assaults in spite of this reality, because if the system cannot provide these things, then it fails and the social contract breaks down. This means bringing to light how common and wrong sexual assault is and creating a process that focuses on victim support and corrective action for the offenders. With efforts focused on these goals, I think our system would likely become one where victims are shown compassion and given support resources and ensured safety, while offenders are put into a practice-based rehabilitative program. With the right strategies, I believe we could dramatically lower the rate of sexual assaults, help victims recover, intervene before people reoffend, and treat everyone as human beings in the process./soapbox**EDIT:** Hmm, it seems most people interpreted my argument to mean something I was totally not trying to say. As I start this post off by saying, it is absolutely correct that the accused are presumed innocent. The point I was making is that this should not translate to "assume the victim is lying until proven otherwise". Instead, because it most times impossible to prove anything, we need to work harder as a society to prevent sexual assault (by speaking out about how common/wrong it is), to standardize our support/safety services to victims and to rehabilitate those who are proven to have offended (rather than think in punitive terms). At this point in time society really just says to victims, "sucks to be you, hope you figure out those issues, but you're probably lying".

After updating this Probook 4730s to the latest ATI drivers the problem vanished.  If somebody knows what causes this behaviour please let me know------------------------------------------------Dear fellow sysadmins, rather new to reddit and allready asking for your help :)So here's the deal, I've been in PC and network support for over 14 years.  Like most of you I'm like a pitbull once I've bitten into the problem I do not release before it's fixed.This problem has made me gona mad in the last days and I'm calling upon you to help me out.This is a work laptop, basic software installed: Windows 7 64bit, Lotus Notes and Openoffice.  Some assorted software like Adobe pdf, flash, google Chrome.All of a sudden Google Chrome stopped working, when you open it it just shows a blank page with in the title bar: loading..  Nothing happens and you cannot do anything.Standard fixes were applied, checking that windows update is up to date.  Removed google chrome, removed Google dirs in %appdata%\ (local and roaming) removed google dir in program files.  Reinstalled std, reinstalled google chrome offline installer: issue remains, nothing helps.Safe mode the browser works, so first thought: virus.There was an up to date mcafee cloud antivirus on it (don't look at me I didnt install that:)- removed mcafee and installed my own managed from gfi max (vipre) -&gt; antivirus installs correctly (after removing mcafee offcourse), updates correctly, quick scan: nothing found.- malwarebytes anti malware scan : nothing found- malwarebytes anti root scan: nothing found- tdsskiller std and custom full scan: nothing found- hijack this: nothing special- combofix: all ok- ran ccleaner cleaned everything up- rolled back ie 11 to ie 10 (i'm getting desperate here)- removed skype and adobe flash- issue remains the same.Any ideas or tips?  My wife will be gratefull as ones it's fixed we can go out on this sunday :)Edit 1: it's properly connected to my wifi network at home.  IE browsing works no isse, chrome browsing only works in Safe Mode.Edit 2: even the -no-sandbox mode does not work, I'm thinking it has to do with the engine that renders the page.  When i run it in xp compatibility mode the chrome interface intself becomes clickable but when trying to load a page (or even the settings page) I just get a blank page.------------------------------------------------UPDATE: problem solved --&gt; seems like it was, never seen this behaviour before.  After updating this Probook 4730s to the latest ATI drivers the problem vanished.  If somebody knows what causes this behaviour please let me know------------------------------------------------

They asked me to replace their old xserve server.  This is their current setup:One Xserve with 2x 76GB disk Connected via firewire: 2 lacie external disks, one for file serving one for backup.  They also use php and coldfusion on xserve tot test development.I was thinking of the following:- one proliant dl360 with enough disk cap and cpu / memory- two 2012 standard servers (one for serving the files and ad with essentials experience on it, they only have 8 people and i would like them to be able to use that mac client to connect to the server) the other vm will be used as development test server where coldfusion and php is running on.I know how to connect a mac on a windows network but this is my first time i will be migrating data from a macos to a windows os.   How would you do this i was thinking of using one of the macs to copy all the data over a weekend.  I use vice versa sync on windows, but I'm sure their are good copy data tools that can give me a report at the end and sync the changes over a few days.Are there any other things i need to calculate in?

Last week a lot of these sites got hacked all of a sudden and a lot of php files had some eval(base64) code added.  I've been cleaning yesterday and restoring from a clean backup.I disabled old jce modules but I'm not sure they came from there.  For the moment I crippled the backend functionality by chowning everything to root in the htdocs dirs.  So far so good but I'm sure I will get some nasty calls next week from people trying to add images to their sites.I've been looking at cloud WAFs but I'm unable to tell if this will suffice on these old Joomla sites.  I think there's some bug in tinymce now in 1.5.26 that gets exploited but I'm not 100% sure.It would be cool to get some pointers tips about WAFs and/or Joomla security.  What have others been using, are they kept safe esspecially when you cannot upgrade to 2.x or 3.x.

Also in regard of the options he wants in the future: vmware HA and FT.They would propose a HP MSA 2040 with a SAS disk enclosure on top.They would sell him HP sas HBA's he can then put in his Dell servers.They would then connect each HBA to the san so he does not need expensive FC switches.I have some doubts about this setup, anyone has any experience with this and would like to share his toughts about this?

I can do this with garage band but it's only 8 measures of recording time. I need something that has unlimited recording, and it must have a monitor mode so I can hear what I'm playing. If it were also able to save the audio file so I can open it on my computer that would be great. Thanks for any help.

Albums include, Recovery by Eminem, All eyez on me by 2pac, The Chronic by dre, Relapse by Eminem, The Blueprint by Jay-Z, N.W.A. "straight outta Compton" 20th anniversary edition and Jay-Z the hits collection volume one. Sorry if this post is all over the place, I've had a couple drinks tonight.

I've finally gotten the hang of FL Studio after dabbling around with it for awhile. My problem is I can't seem to record a sound properly from a VST (I've been using massive) using my midi keyboard, into a pattern or its own sound clip. I use Edison and every time a clip records it becomes all fuzzy and distorted when I play it back. I don't have ASIO, and to be honest I'm not even sure what all that's about. I'm just trying to record a sound into my pattern, I never thought it would be this confusing. Sorry if this post is a mess, I'll clarify any questions if needed

I'm at 85/155 citizens and 145 max land. I've just recently gotten three (3) Corgis in a row from the heart system. I've read the disclaimer saying repeated results are common, but three times in a row? That seems a little over the top ridiculous. I don't know if this is even a rant or just a praise at how great this game is. Honestly though, if I get another Corgi I'm going to throw my phone on the ground and stomp on it as I cry masturbating to ebony porn. /rant

1y9x11	-20768	1392757178	longrange	savage 110 BA vs FCP HS	so after a number of years i am in a position to buy one of the few weapons on my list that i dont own yet. years ago i had my eye on the savage 110 BA. at the time there were no other options and i was impressed with the weapon. now that i have the chance to make a purchase i see there is another model that is cheaper, and i have heard some complaints to the cheek weld on the BAso, i am asking an open ended question. what advantages/disadvantages are there between the two systems and what weapon would you recommend.i am mainly interested in a system around the price point of 1700-2000$ chambered in .338 LM or something comparable (its my extreme range weapon). my focus is on tight groups and range over anything else.

1zn6qp	-20768	1394043027	longrange	savage 110BA .338 range report.	so last week i posted the first pictures of my new rifle, yesterday i took it to the range.i was shooing hornady 285g HPBT match rounds with advertised 2750 fps.i started out at 100 yards hoping i could get on paper, but alas the 20 moa rails meant i was not there so i brought the target in to 25 just to get on paper and see wtf my scope was doing. turns out it was almost 2 feet high at 100 yards.once i got it zeroed i tried to get a few 3 shot groups at 100 yards and i was starting to get frustrated because i couldn't. i found that my first shot tended to be dead center, about 2-3 inches high, and then my following 2 shots would be left 2-3 inches and perfect on elevation. i was getting pissed until i went out and got my target, after realizing that this was a 100 yard group and it was not all that bad with a flyer i decided to take it to 200 yards where i figure it would be perfectly zeroed.again i had the first shot centered and high, and the next two were the single best group i have ever shot less than 1/2 inch center to center at 200 yards. and i have come to think that my first shot is behaving as it does due to it being cold bore, it seems like a huge change but its all i can think of for the first shot of a string to be consistently off.for your amusement here is my final group at 200 yards, DA ~5200', Humidity 26% temp 45f http://i.imgur.com/BBvSXsC.jpg?1

2ap75d	-20768	1405370415	NFA	New to Stamp collecting, a few questions.	so a little about me and my habits/philosophy. i try to keep my weapon ownership down to justifiable uses, mostly to keep myself from spending everything i make on the latest cool gun i only shoot a few times.as it sits i have a short range target rifle (.17 hmr) a long range target rifle (.338 Lapua) an "O shit" handgun (XDM .45) and a "shit just got deep" weapon, currently a Saiga 12. what i want to do is replace the Saiga with something a bit smaller, longer range and more ergonomic. something i can bring to battery more easily in confined spaces. i was thinking an AR platform SBR in .300 BLK eventually suppressed.so the question, whats the easiest way to get the SBR built? buy the upper/lower separate and file the Form 1 myself? or buy from a dealer via Form 4?if i assemble myself i understand there are issues regarding having the parts, and not having the forms approved. someone should have good advice on what to do here. ideally just want the most cost effective means to an SBR.

2usn5h	-20768	1423083653	longrange	savage 12 F/TR .308 vs .223	so i am looking for some thoughts outside my own head here.i am looking to build a rifle for competitions, F class in particular. i live in northern Arizona, and true long range "ranges" are few and far between. so most of my shooting is likely to be done between 100 and 600 yards. of course i have the ben avery not too far away so 1000 yards is not off the table.i use a .17 hmr to effect at 100-200 yards, and i already have a savage 110BA with an NXS 5.5-22x56 for the 1000+ shots. for my 600-1000 yard stuff and the F-Open matches i would eventually like something in 6.5 creedmoor or its kin.i have settled fairly firm on the savage 12 f/tr as a cost effective starter for competitive shooting. my only real question is .223 vs .308. i am leaning .223 more or less due to cost of powder (i do reload)  and lower recoil along with generally shorter available ranges. the only advantages to .308 would be performance at longer ranges, and i think H4350 (my preferred powder for short action 30 cal rifles) is more available than the powders for .223.thoughts?

33sh2j	-20768	1429936659	flying	Takeoff into a dust devil. what i did, what could i do better.	so i had to get a little less than an hour of flight in so i can take my final stage check in preparation for my Instrument checkride.in order to make the numbers work i chose to go up for a 1.0-1.2 flight just around the airport on Thursday the 23rd of April. the winds were a bit strong and gusty, but right down the 7000' runway, and i fly a C172 out of here frequently.first i want to give the ATC recordings so there is a clear understanding of the day, it was busy, KPRC had 21L and 21R active, and on separate frequencies and both were packed. its checkride season and everyone is hustling.linked is the [Live ATC audio](http://archive-server.liveatc.net/kprc/KPRC-Twr-One-Apr-23-2015-1900Z.mp3) of the time frame. i check in with tower at 24:45 and am 1309G. at about 26:00 i get cleared to take off. and just over 30 seconds later, while i am accelerating at 26:40 a call comes in that there is a dust devil at the 1500' markers. (this is normally where i am rotating).from my perspective, it was windy, and as i came out onto the centerline and started accelerating being in a hurry to clear the runway for the several aircraft on final.at this point i see some tumbleweeds blowing across the runway. and the thought that crossed my mind was "cool a chance to actually use that short field takeoff procedure" so i put flaps to 10, mind i am already indicating 20-25 kts and accelerating. as the flaps finish coming down i am getting close to rotation when i hear the dust devil warning.at that time my thoughts were "really bad time to be rotating, guess i need to abort" so i put flaps to 0 and pulled power preparing to lay into the brakes and try not to tip over in the dust devil.and literally the moment i pulled power the gusts hits and picks me up. at this point i the one thing i wanted to try to do less than take off, was to land. so i punched the power, pulled a half turn of mixture to get peak power and held it into high ground effect until i was sure i was clear of gusts and had the airspeed to climb.the rest of the flight was bumpy but uneventful.i just wanted to bring this up and maybe see if more experienced pilots (i only have a hair under 200 hours after all.) would have done anything different.my own hindsight tells me i should pay more attention to the airport environment. i should have noticed that those tumble weeds were associated with something more than just gusts. and i probably should have delayed the takeoff until it had passed. though this would have meant pulling off and taking a few minutes to get cleared again.thoughts?

3h16fz	-20768	1439591233	lossprevention	new(i hope) to LP i have questions.	so i had my guard card (AZ) class sponsored by the manager for my area. took it and it seems i am the only applicant for the position. in short it looks good for getting the job so i am trying to bone up on the subject before i start.i will be doing LP, that's about all i know, the company is a major security contractor, i don't know what store or stores i will have to cover. having read up here it seems likely that i might have a number of locations, i was told there may be a small amount of travel to a nearby city once a week or so, so i am assuming at this time i will have a number of locations.my main question then is what is the job like. you see the violent stops on youtube and stuff but i assume that is avoided if possible. and if you do need to use force, what level of force is usually allowed (i assume it varies by company)my past is USMC logistics which involves a surprising level of security management. have done area security and the like. at hearing this the manager offered me a pay on the upper end of the starting scale.

I have a cat (who is still pretty young, but is really good with other pets) and spend my free time baking, reading, playing video games and watching movies. I won't bring the party home with me, and I am 420 friendly, although I don't really partake in it. PM me if you'd like to start looking at housing together or would like to meet up to see if we'd be a good fit to live together!Thanks!

I was laying in bed with my then-bf, watching a movie, and my kitten came onto the bed and curled up beside me. It was the most adorable spoon-train ever, and it made me pause and just think, "You know, some stuff isn't great right now, but this moment is pretty perfect."

I have a squared-off-horse-shoe shaped one, and I'm hoping there might be a better alternative?2) Has anyone had their retainer fall out after having their piercing for a while? When my piercing was younger the retainer fell out (and I think I swallowed it :/) but I'm hoping this one wont.Thanks!

I do my virgin runs spoiler free but once I complete, I start looking at wikis and reddits vids to see what i missed for my NG+ runs.  what i found was pretty annoying and hopefully this helps a couple of bros out there coming late to the party.1. apparently sorcery is a shell of what it used to be at launch.  from what i've read, it got nerfed into oblivion at some point, I think around May.  the problem is 99% of the guides, tips and youtube vids out there feature the old mage-power structure and are hence, utterly useless now.  so when it comes to sorcery advice, try to ignore anything posted online in the first-half of 2014 because that was easy-mode sorcery and easy-mode sorcery no longer exists.  alternately, you can try to score an unpatched version of the game.2.  the internet is full of people trying to show you how to kill bosses with crystal soul spear, as that is one of the few remaining spells with some punch post-nerf.  problem is, that spell is not available in your first playthrough.  I was pretty thorough in searching every nook and cranny of every zone and it's just not there.  was hoping to see it in eleum lloyce, since that zone features a ton of crystallized mobs but...nop.   you're going to have git gud at killing bosses with a few vanilla souls spears, a few mass crystal homings, and DOZENS of great heavy soul arrows.  in other words, you're going to have to survive for extended periods of time to take some bosses down because some of them are really nasty, magic resistant buggers. 3.  don't be fooled by people trying to show you how to complete things in NG+ or higher mode.  the twink spells and gear are available AFTER you complete your first playthrough or if you uses bonfire ascetics.  if you're trying to get thru the game legit, on your own, without being carried or padded you can safely ignore most of the online guides out there.  the virgin run is tougher than any NG+ run with twink.4.  for bosses, Witchtree branch &gt; Staff of Wisdom.  you'll hear a lot about the staff of wisdom with it's uber INT scaling but like i said earlier, you're going to have to throw DOZENS of great heavy soul spears to take some of the bosses down, which means surviving for extended periods of time and the Witchtree Branches cast speed is a game changer for many fights.  Much easier to cast with and still have time to avoid boss one-shot.tl:dr version - no such thing as glass-cannon sorcery in my experience.  more like glass bee-bee-gun.  Most online resources don't reflect this reality so ignore.  game is wicked and is just as hard as DS1.  people just say DS2 is gimpier because they've already experienced getting crushed for the first time in Demons Souls/DS1.  DS2 is legit on it's own with some amazing architecture and zone layouts and boss concepts.  good luck, have fun.

I don't read guides or copy other people's decks but watch a bit of Kripp.  Keep track of him loosely,  because of his POE skillz before Blizzard bought him.  Mostly I learned by getting pwned and watching how others pwned me.  Not bitching or bragging here.  Just some raw stats so people can track how hard the F2P grind is.**Season 9 stats:*** no-life status = 6 * highest ladder rank = 13 (dread corsair)* best arena key = 3 wins (copper) * Basic Set cards collected - 133* Basic Set gold cards collected - 11* Classic Set cards collected - 13* Classic Set gold cards collected - 0* Rewards Set cards collected - 0* Promo Set cards collected - 0* Naxx Set cards collected - 0* GvG cards collected - 64* GvG gold cards collected - 0**Footnotes*** 1 - first season (9) means tons of easy gold to grind via unique quests. grinding for cards going forward expected to become MUCH more difficult* 2 - money put into game = $0.00* 3 - F2P coz the cost of decks for a glorified paper/scissors/rocks card game is way too insane.  I've heard the average for getting a legendary card is like 1:20 packs which (at $2.00 per pack) means like $40.00 for 1 legendary card a couple epics but mostly throw away commons and rares = buttrape with no lube.* 4 - despite the comments in (3), liking the game and will keep playing it* 5 - will put cash into the game if they ever decide to reduce their pricing to sane levels.  If I can spend $60 for an epic game like Dark Souls and play it like mad for 6 months, I sure as hell am not going take that same $60 bucks and give it to Blizzard for like 1.5 legendary cards.* 6 - will keep posting stats for each season as i go* 7 - your F2P results may vary

For every competent priest player, there's like 6 of you who take forever, virtually every turn.The game is just rock-paper-scissors with pretty cartoon graphics.  Not that complicated.I think the nature of the problem is you just have too many cards for your brain to process.  It's literally driving us mad while you sit there and compute everything.Solution seems straight forward, priest players need fewer cards to stumble and bumble around with per turn.  It's too complicated apparently.  Suggest:- delete northshire cleric- delete thoughtstealIt's maddening enough having you mind control or 2-mana-insta-kill our minions without the privilege of having to wait for the 'rope' each turn.Blizz, needs to do something about this.  Would like to hear some other ideas/suggestions from the community.

33jstq	-20789	1429755504	projecteternity	This game SHOULD HAVE de-throned BG2, but didn't	I mean, with all of the time that has passed and all of the retrospective insights (countless online discussions available) into what made BG2 so well done...combined with all of the advancements in gaming from a development standpoint over the past 25 years...PoE should have been better.  It does a lot of great things and it was AWESOME to play something from the isometric/DnD gaming heritage again.  But I expected more from a 2015 release, using 1990 gaming principles.I guess my biggest beef was the spell system.  I suppose 2nd edition cannot and will not ever be beaten, no matter how much time passes.  In BG2/ToB you absolutely needed to master your understanding of spells.  You literally stood zero chance vs some encounters unless you had the EXACT buffs/debuffs in place for a given foe (liches, beholder/gauth den, illithid city etc...).  Not only did you need very specific spellcasting, but you needed to cast things in a certain order for proper overlap/stacking.  It was pure mastery and an unbeatable feeling of achievement once you figured it out.In addition to the complexity of BG2/ToB encounters, there were some balls-fun mechanics (sequencers, contingencies, simulacrums) that were either very watered-down or completely absent in PoE.PoE is a great kickstarter story and a game well worth playing.  But I can't shake the feeling that it was a blown opportunity to finally de-throne BG2.  Not a rant, but needed to get that off my chest.

I'm thinking we all whiffed on pinpointing the REAL problem in HS, by over-focusing our hate on Undertaker.  Not saying that that card  didn't need an adjustment but it's clear that the agro meta is as prolific as ever post-nerf, despite the fact that Undertaker has virtually vanished from the game as a result. I was thinking today about how little I run into UT any more when I realized just how bad Abusive Sgt is.  Seriously, that little 1-cost mana dude is fucking everwhere and it's literally responsible for 80+ percent of the early game tempo swings I see.Don't you think that if this card is adjusted to 2-mana, it will still remain viable and keep agro decks competitive while helping control become more prevalent?[b]I mean, seriously, what card is worse for the game than abusive sgt?[/b]  Maybe Mechwarper, but the thing is...for every 1 mechwarper i run into on ladder, I see 20-ish Abusive Sgts.Interested in the community's thoughts on this.

Or, at least they are the least utilized cards I have found (excluding folk who are stuck using them temporarily as they  build their deck collection)* Wisp* Worgen Infiltrator* Mana Addict* Mana Wraith* Pint-sized Summoner* Alarm-O-Bot* Thrallmar Farseer* Ancient Mage* Frost Elemental* Ravenholdt Ass.* Windfury Harpy* Priestess of Elune* Silverhand Knight* Venture Co. Merc.* Stranglethorn Tiger* Flesheating Ghoul* Jungle Panther* Mill house Manastorm* Amani BeserkerWas thinking we could immediately circulate them into the game and increase overall deck diversity with just a simple adjustment or a small expansion.  Some examples:1.  Blizzard implements a buff of these (20) cards with a blanket 1-mana cost reduction across the board (meh)2.  Blizzard can bundle these and tag them 'Forgotten' (like mech, demon, pirate etc) and introduce some cards that give them synergies and make them competitive options.I know some people feel like the card game must have some shit cards so people can get tingly in their pants when they craft or win some OP card by comparison.  But I just think that having a bunch of garbage laying around doing nothing is just a bunch of garbage laying around, doing nothing.Thoughts?  Suggestions?

Now we find out that the issues regarding OnePlus' production are much more major than we thought. I quote; "Looking at our traffic stats for the past months, and then looking at how many devices we've delivered thus far, I can speak for the entire team when I say that we are quite stressed at the current state of affairs." That being said, the majority of the people wishing to get their hands on the OnePlus One might not get one any time soon. Furthermore, the model itself might be outdated by the time it becomes easily available (or at least they will have wasted months without any price decrease). The Oppo Find 7 becomes available early July, and is already out for pre-order. It delivers without shipping fees at 480€, versus OPO's 299€ plus shipping. SERIOUS QUESTION: is it still worth it to wait for the OnePlus One? I fear the moment when I will have waited three months with a shitty phone, but I also fear buying a less optimal phone just before I would be able to get the OnePlus One. Anyone want to share their opinion on the matter? Please serious answers only :)

I'm considering buying either the new 980 or something of the same power range if there is a good deal (ie the 290X was on a huge discount recently). I have a FHD monitor from my previous setup, but it is really overkill to use such a monitor with such a GPU? Is power being wasted? I will invest in a 1440p monitor if I find out that a FHD monitor is too "light" for a GPU of such caliber.

My military service ends in March, so I'll be ordering parts for a new PC in February. I know that's in a while, but hey, early bird or something like that. My only criteria is to have a GPU at least as powerful as the new GTX 970, and I was hoping I could also have a build that would enable me to buy another card in the future and to upgrade through SLI/Crossfire (save some money?). Here is my preliminary build:http://pcpartpicker.com/user/Mojitoman/saved/p6CCmGMy budget is somewhere above 1000€ or $1300. That build is a bit higher, but there are all kinds of discounts that it doesn't consider. I will be getting either a 4K or a 2K monitor on top of that but I don't need help with that yet.So, what do you think?

I just wanted to share something that helped me a lot. I found out I am lactose intolerant, two years ago, after five of being a fibromite, and coincidentally consuming dairy when lactose intolerant has been known to cause joint pains.It was diagnosed because of stomach aches, but it took a while because I don't get the diarrhea, just constipation. I am now living diary free, and the pain I have (plus the tiredness) has dropped significantly. When I accidentally am given a dairy product I feel the pain and warmth in my joints after a few hours of eating the product. It didn't remove the pain but it sure lessened it. Be careful to read packages when trying this, the weirdest products contain lactose and other forms of dairy. Try not eating dairy for about two weeks, you should start feeling better in days :)Good luck, I hope it helps more of us!

Now, I want to stop taking these pills because they made me gain a lot of weight, are ruining my teeth and worst of all, I have about zero interest in sex. My vagina feels numb most of the time and it is depressing for both me and my partner. My doctor is quite inexperienced and the more experienced ones have huge waiting lists. Plus I just dont know how to tell this older man that I can no longer reach the O. Does anybody know alternatives that work like cymbalta but are a bit friendlier to the body? I heard anti shaking meds might help too. Anybody experienced in this? Tl; dr need new meds, cymbalta is killing my sex life and health.

1oty9k	-20813	1382270849	ainbow	Advice needed: student wants to come out	I am a mentor to middle school students. They see me 14 hours a week, so we're pretty close. The group is very nice, gentle and they look after each other. The school is gay positive to a certain extent. Although bullying because of gender or preferences does not occur very frequently, it does happen. The mom of one of my students told me that he wants to come out. He wants *me* to tell the class that he is gay. She personally hopes that he will tell them himself, and so do I. This kid is 13 years old. He is often mistaken for a girl, and doesn't really know how to "show" himself to the world. He is socially awkward, but still loves getting attention. He dresses himself in bright pink colours, and is only friends with the girls. Although most of the boys wouldn't really care about him being gay, he alienates them (giggling at them, teasing them), and avoids potential friendships. **Everybody already suspects that he is gay,** and he still has some friends. He is not popular, but he also is not unpopular. When I tried to talk to him about being gay, he avoided it and didn't come out to me. I only know for sure because his mom told me. I never had to come out, I just introduced my partners and never labelled it. Hence, I am lost. I have no idea how these things work, and how these kids will respond.I want to make this a painless process, and I'd prefer not doing it for him. So. My question: What is the best way to do this? *I don't want to tell the class that he is gay.* I think it would be better if he told them himself.     tldr; socially awkward gay student wants ME to tell the world, and I think it's better if he does it. Help!
1w75t6	-20813	1390752194	Fibromyalgia	[Fibrostudent] uses [workweek] It's not very effective..	Dear reader, I am a sad fibromite, and have been one for the past two weeks. You see, I am in my final year of a university education. I have been studying my ass off to get my Bachelor of Education, and am currently employed at a lovely school. I very much enjoy my life, and I love that a school has enough faith in me as a person, and a fibromite, to employ me. However, my uni has a strict program. To graduate, one needs to complete all parts of the program. This is where fibro kicks me in the balls, if I had any. I failed the exams at the end of the workweeks I am required to go on. These workweeks are 5 days of excursions, in the outdoors, sleeping in very old farms. Basically, they are a lot of fun, but also cost a lot of spoons. At the end of each week there is an exam on the things the teacher told us on the many walks we had to take. Due to being completely, out of my brain, utterly knackered, I fail these stupid tests every single time. However, there is no way to redo the test when back home, as all the material is inside the head of the teacher. Their solution: go on the workweek again..I have rarely ever been so incredibly angry with someone as I am right now. I contacted the supervisor that was assigned to me, as a disabled student, but I feel horrible. I have incredibly good grades, I never failed any other test, I never had to do retakes, except for these workweeks. I am an Honours Student, and they treat me like shit. They tell me to just "make it easy for everyone involved" and just "give in". Like it is a matter of giving in. It is not about being right, it is about being incapable. I hate how powerless they make me feel, and how incredibly dumb I feel for failing these tests.I hate that they refuse to accept my suggestions at an alternative.I hate that they make me go to the supervisor that coordinates disabled students.I hate how they make me feel so incredibly disabled.I needed to vent, even if no one reads this. I feel so incredibly helpless, and I can't help but cry, no matter how strong I want to be. Thank you.Tl;dr: Honours Student might not be able to graduate because fibro prevents me from passing the exams given at the end of the mandatory work weeks.. :/

2lrf03	-20813	1415541625	relationships	Me [23 F] with my coworker[30+ M] of a few months, he doesn't listen to me and keeps "flirting" and pushing for meetups.	So I have, in my opinion, the best job in the world. I work there for over a year now, have a good long term contract and get a lot of joy out of my work. I work in a very close and tight knit team, we occasionally go out for a drink and sometimes have dinner in a group. Recently we have been joined by a few new coworkers. One of them, Chad*, is an old friend/acquaintance of several of my other coworkers. They have inside jokes and such. He is quite charismatic and funny, which made me happy at first.  He has been married for 12+ years. From the beginning he started paying me and my other female coworker (30F) a bit more attention then the rest of the crew. He will bring me tea in the morning and stay for long chats. He got me a nice present when I had a special occasion to celebrate (now, the team got me a gift as well a few days before he joined, but it still made me feel a bit weird). He will say friendly/flirty things about my appearance and personality. He is a touchy person and will put a hand on your arm/shoulder when he speaks with you. He also put a hand on my knee once, but I instantly told him off. I find this all very "bordering the edge" and it makes me feel quite uncomfortable. He does not do things that are openly/overly flirty, so I am not even sure if he is flirting with me. I mean, I think he is but he hasn't abused me or something.Now the problem: it appears as if he does not have many friends outside of his marriage. He also seems to be depressed. He always texts me in the weekends asking if I want to do stuff together, outside of work. I don't really, in the weekends I like to hang out with my friends or go out. He also tells me many negative things about his marriage and how he does not feel like it will last. I try to set up subtle boundaries by saying things like: "I usually hang out with friends in the weekends." I also put up more strict boundaries by telling him off for stroking my back whilst talking to me and telling him to go home and talk to his wife instead of me. I don't even really know what my question is. I feel uncomfortable around him and I do not want this all to escalate. I love my job and I don't want to jeopardize it. I don't want to tell "HR"(I don't think we have HR, so I'd have to tell my boss who is a friend of his) because I don't know if I am being paranoid or not. He hasn't abused me or forced himself onto me or anything, and I don't want to slander his name. I don't want to hurt his feelings but I also don't want to be put in this position.---   **tl;dr**: I do not know how to approach a coworker who may or may not be flirting with me (he also seems to lack friends/maybe wants to escape his home situation/sad). Need some clues on how to approach this.*he isn't really called Chad.. 
2lutbq	-20813	1415624958	relationships	Update: Me [23 F] with my coworker[30+ M] of a few months, he doesn't listen to me and keeps "flirting" and pushing for meetups.	Original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2lrf03/me_23_f_with_my_coworker30_m_of_a_few_months_he/ The amount of advice I have been given over this is overwhelming. Thank you all so much for your time and your advice, it gave me (sort of) a handle on things. I then messed it up but here goes. I went to work with a plan: Step 1: Block him on my phone. So far so good, this went fine. Step 2: Find my older female friend and ask her if she has time to meet up. We have an appointment for tomorrow, she was very busy today. Which is good, she can give me some advice on the rest that happened. Step 3: Talk to him. I failed here. He squeezed my arm when he saw me and winked at me and I just reached a breaking point. I ignored him, walked away, and went and found my boss. She was quite busy, so I went away, without speaking to her or anyone. I was standing in the hallway feeling upset and a bit lost when my bosses boss (Alice) saw me. She sat me down in her office and told me to tell her everything because she could tell something was up. So I did. I cried a lot because I felt so trapped. It was ridiculous, I can't believe I let it come this far, that I let myself get so upset. Anyway, Alice told me that this was a known problem with his family. They have a history of mental illness for which they are medicated.They will have these weird crushes on people and will really "hang" on them for support. She said he probably felt attracted to me because I am a happy, friendly person. She told me that this was in no way my fault, that it was completely inappropriate and that I had several options to think about today. She will either discuss this with the big boss (director of the workplace) and they will sit him down together for an informal warning, or I can talk to the HR people (which we apparently have) at work and they can sit him down and give him a warning, or I can handle it myself. If I do the last part, they will help me handle it. She told me she has known him since he was a child and that she is very capable of talking to him about how inappropriate it is to be this way to me. She told me that if we handle this now, we can nip it in the bud and it won't get out of control. So now I am just avoiding him as much as I can and thinking of which option to go with. I am feeling very relieved that it is all out in the open now. I am kind of torn between asking her to do it or putting my big girl panties on and telling him myself, but I have a whole day to think it through. ---   **tl;dr**: Told another one of my bosses everything and she can either solve it for me, solve it with me or support me as I solve it myself. Not sure which option to pick, but I feel such relief that it is over. 
2nxffo	-20813	1417427329	relationships	Update #2: Me [23 F] with my coworker[30+ M] of a few months, he doesn't listen to me and keeps "flirting" and pushing for meetups.	Previous posts: [first](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2lrf03/me_23_f_with_my_coworker30_m_of_a_few_months_he/) [second](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2lutbq/update_me_23_f_with_my_coworker30_m_of_a_few/)Firstly, thank you guys for all the nice messages. They made me feel confident enough to tell my mum, even though I felt very embarrassed over the whole thing. She got very protective, which was a nice feeling. So, I had hoped I wouldn't have to update this but it seems like I should. I put on my big girl panties and confronted him myself, with the assistance of a friendly coworker who stayed nearby. He had cornered me the evening before, stating he knew something was going on between "us" and felt bad about it and wanted to talk about me ignoring his messages. So I knew I had to do something. I stood up to him and asked to have a chat. I took him aside with my coworker lurking around. I told him literally what you guys said: "I am assuming you are not doing this on purpose but you are making me feel uncomfortable. You come too close in every way, physically but also in the way you communicate with me. It makes me feel uncomfortable and I don't feel it's appropriate."He replied that he felt sorry I feel that way, and then he said: "I knew I should have expected this to happen, this is what you get for opening up to people. I will be here for you when you feel comfortable again, I am sorry." I thought this was a bit guilt trippy, so I just said: "Eh, okay." And walked away. I thought that was it, we had some professional communication about work through our work emails, and that is fine. But today he just walked up to me and said he was very angry with me. He said that he thought we had built something, and that he thought we were friends and now I just "dumped him". He said that I should think about that, and about what I did. I am pretty pissed right now. I thought this was over, felt a lot better and now he is starting this. How do I respond to this, if I choose to respond at all? ---   **tl;dr**: Coworker is angry with me for telling him I feel uncomfortable. He told me he was upset with me for dumping him. What to say/do?

388687	-20813	1433258394	relationships	Do I (23F) go back to work tomorrow or do I wait on what my GP says?	I really love this sub and I might need some advice. I have had great advice on an earlier problem, and want to ask it now. To start with: my job is not in jeopardy. I live in a country with pretty neat laws so I cannot be fired for either option. For the past few months my job has been very stressful. Several things (you can pm me if you need specifics) happened in succession, and although I asked for help and gave a signal that I was struggling with these things, not much happened. These were all extraordinary things, that are not normally part of the job. So it's been tough, but somehow it has gotten to a point where I cry myself to sleep, because I get panic attacks even thinking of going to work. I just can't seem to get my ducks in a row and the more I try the less I seem to be able to do, it feels like that dream where you try to run but nothing happens. So anyway, I figured I had a problem, so I called my GP and asked for an appointment. I have taken off yesterday and today since I felt like it was becoming ridiculous. I do feel a little better today, but I am not sure if I will still feel that way tonight. Either way, I am not sure whether I should go to work tomorrow and work the first few hours, or just call in sick and wait for what my doctor says. I do plan on speaking with my boss tomorrow, so I am not sure if it will seem weird if I show up when I am "sick". My question: what would you guys do? Also, if you have any advice that could help me manage this stress/panic thing that would be appreciated. Thanks a lot :)    **tl;dr**: Can't sleep/think of work without feeling dread/anxiety. Do I go in tomorrow or wait until my appointment with the GP (also tomorrow)?

So my kitty will be staying home when I go on vacation, and I found a friend who is willing to take her in for the time being.

I'd only be gone for 2 weeks, so it's not all that long. What do you guys think?

1gxp07	-20820	1372030804	flying	Learned a good lesson today: Always pre-flight.	As the title says I almost messed myself up by not pre-flighting the airplane and trusting the student before me. This morning I got to the airport and the 150 I fly had already been flown and had just been shutdown. My instructor and I get in and do some soft and short field landings and then he tells me to fly solo to KEDE (first time soloing out side of my airports vicinity btw, yay). I fly to KEDE and my instructor flew about 30 minutes behind me so I wait around for him. When he gets there he notices a lot of oil on the ground coming from the 150. We walk over to the right side of the plane and there is oil EVERYWHERE. Apparently, the student before me had left the oil cap completely unscrewed and the plane had been operating on 3 quarts of oil. I guess I'm lucky nothing bad happened and I'm glad I learned this lesson before something more serious happened because of my negligence. Lesson learned.

Who would not love thee, thou innocent, impatient, wind-swift, child-eyed sinner!Wither pullest thou me now, thou paragon and tomboy? And now foolest thou me fleeing; thou sweet romp dost annoy!I dance after thee, I follow even faint traces lonely. Where art thou? Give me thy hand! Or thy finger only!
28tgoc	-20829	1403470026	GetMotivated	The Three Evil Things	In my dream, in my last morning-dream, I stood today on a promontory---beyond the world; I held a pair of scales, and *weighed* the world.Alas, that the rosy dawn came too early to me: she glowed me awake, the jealous one! Jealous is she always of the glows of my morning-dream.Measurable by him who hath time, weighable by a good weigher, attainable by strong pinions, divinable by divine nut-crackers: thus did my dream find the world:My dream, a bold sailor, half-ship, half-hurricane, silent as the butterfly, impatient as the falcon: how had it the patience and leisure today for world-weighing!Did my wisdom perhaps speak secretly to it, my laughing, wide-awake day-wisdom, which mocketh at all "infinite worlds"? For it saith: "Where force is, there becometh *number* the master: it hath more force."How confidently did my dream contemplate this finite world, not new-fangledly, not old-fangledly, not timidly, not entreatingly:---As if a big round apple presented itself to my hand, a ripe golden apple, with a coolly soft, velvety skin: thus did the world present itself unto me:---As if a tree nodded unto me, a broad-branched, strong-willed tree, curved as a recline and a foot-stool for the weary travellers: thus did the world stand on my promontory:---As if delicate hands carried a casket towards me---a casket open for the delectation of modest adoring eyes: thus did the world present itself before me today:---Not riddle enough to scare human love from it, not solution enough to put to sleep human wisdom: a humanly good thing was the world to me today, of which such bad things are said!How I thank my morning-dream that I thus at today's dawn, weighed the world! As a humanly good thing did it come unto me, this dream and heart-comforter!And that I may do the like by day, and imitate and copy its best, now will I put the three worst things on the scales, and weigh them humanly well.He who taught to bless taught also to curse: what are the three best cursed things in the world? These will I put on the scales.*Voluptuousness, passion for power,* and *selfishness*: these three things have hitherto been best cursed, and have been in worst and falsest repute---these three things will I weigh humanly well.Well! Here is my promontory, and there is the sea---*it* rolleth hither unto me, shaggily and fawningly, the old, faithful, hundred-headed dog-monster that I love!Well! Here will I hold the scales over the weltering sea: and also a witness do I choose to look on---thee, the anchorite-tree, thee, the strong-odoured, broad-arched tree that I love!On what bridge goeth the now to the hereafter? By what constraint doth the high stoop to the low? And what enjoineth even the highest still---to grow upwards?Now stand the scales poised and at rest: three heavy questions have I thrown in; three heavy answers carrieth the other scale.
28ulb9	-20829	1403500935	GetMotivated	The Tree on the Hill	Zarathustra's eye had perceived that a certain youth avoided him. And as he walked alone one evening over the hills surrounding the town called "The Pied Cow," behold, there found he the youth sitting leaning against a tree, and gazing with wearied look into the valley. Zarathustra thereupon laid hold of the tree beside which the youth sat, and spoke thus:"If I wished to shake this tree with my hands, I should not be able to do so.But the wind, which we see not, troubleth and bendeth it as it listeth. We are sorest bent and troubled by invisible hands.Thereupon the youth arose dinconcerted, and said: "I hear Zarathustra, and just now was I thinking of him!" Zarathustra answered:"Why art thou frightened on that account? But it is the same with man as with the tree.The more he seeketh to rise into the height and light, the more vigorously do his roots struggle earthward, downward, into the dark and deep---into the evil.""Yea, into the evil!" cried the youth. "How is it possible that thou hast discovered my soul?"Zarathustra smiled, and said: "Many a soul one will never discover, unless one first invent it.""Yea, into the evil!" cried the youth once more."Thou saidst the youth, Zarathustra, I trust myself no longer since I sought to rise into the height, and nobody trusteth me any longer; how doth that happen?

2nvbye	-20835	1417378514	StarWars	Wanted to put in my two cents on the new saber.	A good deal of the people here seem to be questioning the logic of having the beam crossguards. (That is, if they even are beams, as other people have theorized they aren't.)In the other six movies, we got a good look at the fighting style typically associated with Jedi, Sith, and lightsabers in general. Since they lack much of the elements of a traditional sword, and are basically just a straight cylinder, the wielder can do lots of fancy end-over-end tricks, twirls, spins, etc etc. However, with the addition of the crossguard on this guy's saber, as well as what appears to be a longer main blade, I believe he will have to fight differently. He'll likely use more traditional sword techniques, such as two-handed thrusts and powerful overhead chops, without the fancy flourishes that would probably cost him a hand. Yes or no? 
2o7pe2	-20835	1417655736	StarWars	Your favorite EU book/series? Least favorite?	Personally, my favorite is Mike Stackpole's standalone novel "I, Jedi" for its outstanding take on morality, duty, and other bits. Plus, Corran Horn is one of the best written characters in the universe. I despise the entire New Jedi Order series, however. The Yuuzhan Vong are so out of place in the overall theme of Star Wars, and the entire thing is clunky and overdone. I barely got through the first three or four before dropping it entirely in disgust.

I have those quite frequently. However, this time it was something different. I saw one cross my bedroom directly in front of me. It was very late, around midnight, and I was just getting into bed. As my eyes went from the door to the hallway to the bathroom, a silhouette appeared. It seemed very solid in the torso area, but seemed to fade out as it got farther down towards the legs. It moved in a motion I can only describe as skating past the edge of my bed and vanished as it reached the wall. In reaction, I stood up, surprised. As I did so, I got that extremely hot prickling sensation you get sometimes when you feel that something isn't right or there is someone watching you, the feeling like hundreds of small needles digging into your neck and scalp. Slowly, carefully, I got back in bed and looked around for a bit before turning out my light. The prickly feeling lasted a few solid minutes after the incident, remaining extremely strong and uncomfortable. Any ideas what happened to me?

I thought that the parts for your first lightsaber were strictly awarded for certain quests. Anyone else find anything unusual as a drop from a Cannok?
2rffvd	-20835	1420485867	StarWars	Why did only Obi-Wan and Yoda fade away after their deaths?	I'm a big fan of the extended universe, and have read multiple books stating that all Jedi Masters' bodies disappear upon death. However, other similar books and EU works, as well as the prequel movies, feature the deaths of many Masters, and none of them fade away at all. Was this just something Yoda and Kenobi achieved because of their wisdom and Force power? Is it something of the opposite of the "Force explosion" that occurred when Palpatine died? I'm really confused.
2spmzi	-20835	1421474765	StarWars	Why are worlds and cultures made to seem so small or one-sided in Star Wars?	In all of the Star Wars media I've encountered, be it books, games, movies, television, anything, they all seem to share two things: they really don't make anything culturally diverse or recognize size and scale very well. When a character in a video game, let's say KotOR, lands on a planet, like Dantooine, they're given a tiny part of the world to explore. However, the character's actions seem to affect the entire planet. Khoonda is said to be the center of Dantooine's government, but its barely bigger than a normal house and has nothing around it. I know that's kind of a specific example, and many people might not get it, but you can find many other similar instances of the shrinking of a planet it if you look closely.All of the planets in Star Wars only have one general type of environment. Tatooine is a big desert, Yavin 4 is a big jungle, Mustafar is a big volcanic wasteland, and so on. All of the cultures have one defining characteristic. Mandalorians are all warriors. Corellians are all cocky and brash. Alderaanians are all peaceful and diplomatic. Is this shrinking and disappearance of diversity among the races in Star Wars because of the size of the universe and number of places in it, or is it something else entirely?

I'm a vassal to the Vaegirs. I'm quickly becoming a favorite for helping to take so much territory from the Nords. We recently made peace with the Nords and the Khergits declared war on us right afterwards. I confronted a Khergit lord that was raiding one of my fiefs. Seeing as I rely on my fiefs for funding, this always pisses me off. He had around 10 units less than me and because I was used to taking on Nord armies almost twice my size and annihilating them I prepared to descend on this bastard and squish his army into the ground. Naturally, it didn't go so well. In the end he left me with about 20 mostly untrained units to go on. Since then I've been trying to recruit as many men as I can, but the Khergit troops are pretty much the perfect soldiers. They start with horses and get god tier equipment quickly as they advance. My highly trained mix of cavalry and archers keeps getting flattened and I'm almost entirely out of money. Just recently they showed up with 1000+ troops and stole Dhirim from us, after we had worked so hard to take it from the Swadians. What do I do to stop them from destroying everything I've worked for?

And before you ask, no I'm not using quickplay. The server browser says that Valve servers in virginia, the closest place to me, have between 100 and 130 ping. How do I fix this?

I've been sick the past few days, and when I'm sick I always have more vivid and numerous dreams.I had several last night, and one particular one included me and several friends attempting to escape a giant supermarket complex and being chased by the police. After breaking out through a giant skylight, we ran in a random direction through the woods, running across several suburban neighborhoods. At one point one of my friends passed out on the ground. When I went to help them up, it occurred to me how odd it was that they had just suddenly appeared like that on the ground. I looked at my hands as I was bent over and realized I was dreaming as my right hand was missing two fingers. I somehow immediately changed the dreamscape into a beautiful meadow (kind of like that windows XP default background) but then a few seconds later it vanished and I was thrown back into my previous dream, once again unaware. How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Just to clarify: I'm currently rank 24, and have a bit over 100 hours in the game. I was playing on a TO server a few days ago, and there was a casual discussion going on about helmets. One player had told another to put his gold helmet on, that his acting like a new player was deceptive. That player responded that he didn't like the rank helmets and that he preferred to play in style. I put in that I agreed, the rank helmets looked kind of silly on most of the armor. Some random asshole immediately voted to kick me, and it succeeded with something like 80%. I asked why I was being kicked for expressing my harmless opinion, that I just wanted to play, and got no answer. Well, thanks. That was the only TO server on my list with people playing and &lt;100 ping. Why do people continue to get away with shit like this? Nobody will want to keep playing the game with that kind of behavior.

I mean, the grip color is a weird washed out blue, and the pommel and crossguard are both extremely strange looking and unpractical. The two tiny blood channels on the side don't add up either. I've never seen a historical longsword that looks anything like it.

3che3o	-20835	1436308980	TheSlashering	Something Slasher needs.	I've noticed in all of the clips released so far that actually finishing an enemy off isn't as satisfying as it is in Chivalry. It took me a bit to figure out why, but it's very obvious now: Slasher's hitsounds and other effects are much quieter and subtler. In Chivalry, it's always a glorious and satisfying moment when you take someone's head clean off. There's a loud, solid impact noise. The gore is very real, and not just for decaps, either. Every hit is solid and lets you know you did some damage. In Slasher you get kind of a muffled squish. Personally, this takes away a large part of what makes fighting up close and personal so great in the first place, and why I like Chivalry's combat so much. Anyone else agree?

3fk1l1	-20835	1438556552	mountandblade	The fief leeches.	Fief leeches. That's what I've decided to call these creatures, for they're definitely not sentient beings. I just took Wercheg from the Nords. I had to call a campaign, because the town was the Nords' last holdout in this part of the map. So I rallied my troops, and we put all four-hundred something of them in the ground. Now, the battle is over and the town is left defenseless. My fellow lords and I lock down and stay put to protect the fortress until King Yaroglek will decide who to award Wercheg to.They come in the middle of the night. Not all at once, but in a steady trickle, circling the town with a predatory hunger about them. One by one, the lowest, least important vassals of each and every kingdom that we Vaegirs are at war with arrive, all of the Swadians, Sarranids, Khergits and Nords that were on that half of the continent at the time. They move close to the town, see the armies camped around it, and then run away quickly, only to return in a few seconds and do the same thing. They bob forward and backward around the town without ever making a move or ever backing down. They just keep WATCHING. Hoping that the occupying forces will eventually leave so they can get their free land. They aren't powerful or well-connected. They likely aren't even part of the same kingdom they started in. The leeches travel with groups of only up to 30 or 40 men to ensure that if you try to give chase and stop their flitting about for good, they will avoid you long enough for those on the other side of the circle to swoop in and change the town's allegiance. By the time the appointed ruler of the town arrives, the leeches have grown in number far too much. They chase him away with their intimidating war dance, only to continue to play the waiting game with the defenders. When the sun rises and all ordinary folk have gone insane with their constant vigil, the leeches still search for a chance to slip in and claim new property.~Basically, this is my situation right now. I took Wercheg and I have some ten or fifteen enemy vassals keeping me penned in while I try to defend it. What do?

A lot of the time when I reopen the browser (and restore the session) after a while away from the computer, I don't NER to resume from page 5 or wherever I was earlier because everything has changed.  Or reddit might be under heavy load and it may never complete.  There's no way to escape from NER trying to resume itself at the moment (in RES 4.0.2 on Firefox 8 at least) and the only way to proceed is to remove the NERpage=x anchor in the address bar.  A close button on the overlay, [like this](http://i.imgur.com/JLI6G.png), that just hides the overlay and removes the NER anchor would be useful in both of these situations.

2ak03k	-20879	1405217484	EliteDangerous	Docking port etiquette	It seems that there really isn't any, at least in real terms.  I've not been playing that long and I've been involved in several docking port crashes where people come whizzing through at crazy angles and speeds or approach the port out of view of other pilots and suddenly turn into it at the last second, putting themselves on collision course.If you do collide or clang against the side of the docking port, you risk either damaging your ship while you're pinging about or worse, incurring the wrath of the station defences.  Not a good situation to be in.We should be able to avoid this.  When boats pass, they normally try to do so to the port side (right-to-right when facing each other).  The space station docking ports are all marked with port (red) and starboard (green) lights on each side.  Due to the spin of the station and the tricky question of just what is port and starboard in a 3D environment, it's not as simple as right-to-right but if everybody attempted to keep to the marked port (red) side when entering and exiting and gave way to larger ships or those being silly, we'd all get more of our cargo and paintwork through in one piece.I suspect in a subreddit like this I'm probably preaching to the choir but after yet another near miss with a wally flying fast at a silly angle through Aulin Enterprice airlock, I wanted to vent a bit :)

They kinda lead you to assume that the entire end faces of the docking areas can be opened wide, don't they?  I wonder if one day we're going to see enormous capital ships arriving at stations...  Perhaps they dock against those long spikes at the centre of the back end of the station?

2cgxjq	-20879	1407031443	EliteDangerous	Pronunciation of system names...	So for particular systems whose names are not easily pronounced or when there are multiple ways of pronouncing them, I find myself wondering what is correct?The most obvious is Aulin.  Is it "all-in" or "ow-lin"?  I've certainly heard both used often.  Surely only one is technically correct (the best kind of correct)?Another is i Bootis.  I've always considered it "eye boot-iss" but in a Witchspace Diaries video earlier, CMDR Apocrapha referred to it as "eye boo-O-tees".  Again, which is correct?Obviously as we get further and further from the starting systems (once FD let us loose), this kind of question will become less and less relevant but for the central systems with large amounts of activity, can we find an agreed upon name for each?

This has become a real thorn in my side the last few days and has transformed what should have been a quick afternoon job into a multi-day saga.  A couple of months ago I made a quick deal with my father in law.  He'd rotate the tires on my '01 V70 while I fixed his computer.  I thought nothing more of it.Fast forward to this weekend just gone and I'm gonna replace the brake pads and rotors on the back.  I can't get the lug nuts off.  Not for love nor money.  Using the trusty pipe method, I manage to bend the cheapo tire iron that comes with the car.  Bought a big 20" 4-way and still can't get them off.  Try a liberal amount of WD-40, a bigger pipe for more torque.  I manage to break 4 of 5 loose on one side but the other six are still stuck fast.  I tweak my back and decide that's enough.I find the nearest tire shop open on Sundays and they set about it with a breaker bar and the impact gun.  Still, no movement.  Note they're not stripped, they just won't budge at all.  Since the Pep Boys guy is doing me a favour, he's reluctant to try anything more violent in case it breaks something.  He suggests I take it to the Volvo shop and ask them how to get them off.My father in law must have over-torqued them something crazy.  The brakes are overdue replacement so I need those nuts off.  I'd let him fix it but he's just had surgery and is a proud southern guy so I'd rather he didn't find out that he screwed up...So any ideas before I head to Volvo and they charge me a fortune to undo some nuts?  These are the type of lug nuts we're talking about: http://i.imgur.com/TSBbm9K.jpgI'm at the end of my tether...

2iq34o	-20879	1412822481	EliteDangerous	Elite Dangerous Mythbusters: Is it possible to travel to another system in Super Cruise in Beta 2?	It was well known that in Beta 1 and earlier that no matter how much time you spent travelling towards another star system in Super Cruise, the distance between you and the distant star(s) would never decrease.  However, in Beta 2, when you point at a relatively nearby star system in Super Cruise and start travelling, the 'time to destination' clock starts decreasing.  So does that mean the game has changed and you can now travel between star systems without using hyper drive?  ###***No it hasn't and no, you can't - here is why:**** For this example, we are going to try travelling from the system **ADS 10329** to **Ao Qin**.  These systems are relatively close: 1.70^Ly apart. http://i.imgur.com/h9KqBKI.jpg http://i.imgur.com/vO4DzKk.jpg* We can determine with some simple maths at which point the in-game distance display should change from 1.70^Ly to destination to 1.69^Ly.  For simplicity's sake, we can ask Google how far 1.70^Ly is in light seconds: https://www.google.com/search?q=1.70+light+years+in+light+seconds And it will tell us that the answer is 53,646,774^Ls.  * If we divide the number of light seconds between the stars by 170, [we can show](https://www.google.com/search?q=53646774+%2F+170) that after travelling roughly 315,569^Ls from the starting location, we should expect the in-game 'distance remaining' indication to drop to 1.69^Ly.  This doesn't happen: http://i.imgur.com/6U0204Q.jpg As you can see, after travelling roughly twice the distance that should have been necessary for the distance remaining to Ao Qin to drop to 1.69^Ly, it has not changed.  We are moving further and further away from ADS 10329, our origin system **but we are not moving closer to our destination**.* For the avoidance of all doubt, concern about rounding errors and skepticism, I allowed the game to continue travelling in Super Cruise until we were *much* further away from the origin star: http://i.imgur.com/KIzc6UP.jpg   http://i.imgur.com/EytuYdv.jpg As you can see, at that point, I was 0.15 light years from the origin star **but still the very same 1.70 light years from the destination**.  The time-to-destination counter however, continued to move downwards throughout.  It lies.Conclusion:  Star systems are still (and probably always will be) distinct play areas as far as the game is concerned.  You cannot travel between them, no matter how close they are, by any means other than hyperspace.----**TL;DR:  You cannot travel from system to system in Super Cruise, no matter how patient you are or how close the systems are.  The game doesn't allow it at this time and in this sense, the time-to-destination timer is fudged and doesn't mean a thing.** 
2issyb	-20879	1412892143	EliteDangerous	2.05 seems to have almost completely borked exploration for me. Anybody else having similar problems?	I've just ticketed some pretty extensive problems I'm having with exploration since the 2.05 patch went live.* Often, the message "Discovered 1 new astronomical object" is spammed repeatedly to my message console for the very same object over and over again.* Sometimes I cannot lock onto stars that have been discovered to scan them.* If I do manage to scan them, they sometimes stay as "unknown" afterwards.* And even if I do manage to get the data, when I click the Universal Cartographics tab in the station services menu, the screen locks for several minutes before eventually saying "Unable to get cartography listing from the webserver".Considering the patch notes suggested that this release dealt solely with loading time issues and contained no other changes, it seems a bit strange that a whole play-style should be broken by it.I'm wondering if everybody is having these problems or if it's just something about my particular setup with is scuppering me...[edit to add] Also, about 80% of the bulletin boards I view at the moment have zero postings.

A couple of days ago I was around the starter systems and practically every station had missions seeking tea for huge rewards.  I set off on what turned out to be a long expedition to find some, eventually filling my hold with tea right down at the far end of the bubble, and came back home.And now all the tea missions have vanished.  I've just spent an hour pootling around stations and haven't been able to flog even one of the 80+ tonnes of exotic dead leaves I carry.It's really very annoying.  None of the stations that 'should' have it have been restocked so why does nobody want it any more?A cargo that could have been worth about 250-300K can currently only be dumped for about 140K at Azeban City (best price I found, 1800/t).

2lf1ud	-20879	1415229751	EliteDangerous	The trading glass ceiling... (Or: I hope we get a ship larger than the Asp but smaller than the Type 9 pretty soon).	I was pleased to see trading become profitable again in Beta 3, since it's always been the core of money making in Elite and certainly the easiest for less combat-minded players.  However, I wonder if the glass ceiling that Frontier have put into the trading pathway in this release is intentional or not?  I've just hit it square on and frankly, reached a point where trading is no longer a viable progression route.I assumed when I saw the details of the Imperial Clipper and the Federal Dropship that, considering the sharp cost increase and that they appear physically larger, both would have increased internal space compared to the Asp and would represent a stepping stone up to the Lakon Type 9.  They don't.  An Asp fully kitted out for trading (all internal compartments fitted with the largest possible cargo rack) can carry 192t. Similarly kitted out, the Imperial Clipper and Federal Dropship max out at 180t and 164t respectively.  The next step upwards in cargo capacity from the Asp is still the Type 9, which can carry 532t of cargo*However, the Type 9 is one *massive* grind to reach with an Asp.  It costs approximately 12 times as much as an Asp and even if you hit a 1000cr/t route, it will take an enormously long time to save up the roughly 70 million credits you'd need to buy a one (76 million if you don't want to part exchange).  So basically I've reached a point where there's no point carrying on as a trader.  All I can now do is grind with little hope of reaching the Type 9 before the next big release or downgrade to a smaller ship and go back to making much smaller amounts of money bounty hunting or mining.We really need a ship (or even several) that fills the gap between the Asp and the Type 9 for traders.  Either that or the internal compartments of the Clipper or the Dropship need a buff.----*There's an assumption here, that the pattern of capacity of cargo racks being 2^^n where n is the class that applies for C1 through C6 also applies to C7 and C8.

It looks like Frontier's promised changes to the rare commodities market was just pushed out while I was on a run.I picked up some Bast Snake Gin for about 1000cr/tonne as usual.  At Any Na, 160LY away, the sale price is **less** than I bought it for:http://i.imgur.com/bRCdGAh.jpgIf I sell my cargo, I'll take a **loss** of 33000cr.  Earlier on, just an hour or so ago, it was selling for about 17000/tonne at the same starport.The Any Na Coffee that I was expecting to buy and return with to Bast is also all funky at the moment.  It has a purchase cost of double the galactic average, implying it will sell for a loss wherever I take it.  Also, availability has been slashed from about 70t earlier today to 4t now.  http://i.imgur.com/2NtT8ys.jpgIt seems like the rare goods market is in an inconsistent state at the moment while Frontier's changes are propagating and so trading in rare goods is clearly not advised until the price settles and we see how (or if) it can be made profitable again. ----[edit] Or maybe not?!  Very strange, same station, same instance (haven't left or logged out, just sat there) and this is now the market for the coffee 15 minutes later:http://i.imgur.com/eHz5rPl.jpgThat appears almost back to normal.

It seems plausible right? Does anyone have any experience with this type of thing?

wi8qy	-20889	1342198307	neuro	Computer engineering undergrad in love with brains, worried for career prospects	Like the title says, I &lt;3 neuroscience and am planning on switching majors to it sometime this year. I've been taking bio classes for a semester already (because I decided to switch a semester ago, and now am getting academic cold feet). I went in to computer engineering (and originally mech. E with the intention of doing prosthetics stuff) with the intention of doing neuroscience all along, but quickly realized the only classes I liked were bio classes. I spend a lot of my time learning about the brain and reading research papers "for fun" (I'm sure I'm not alone in this).I've seen articles like [this one](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/us-pushes-for-more-scientists-but-the-jobs-arent-there/2012/07/07/gJQAZJpQUW_story.html?hpid=z1)  recently and I'm becoming increasingly worried that I'll never make any money or that I won't be able to get a job or a paid research position, since funding seems to be in the toilet. (Note: not looking to get rich here, but I'd like to be able to live comfortably / possibly start a family at some point.)I realize that I'll be in school for another 4-5 years (at least, including grad school), and so the situation will have undoubtedly changed by then).Another confounding factor is that computer engineering is really quite relevant if I want to go into neuro (fMRI signal analysis, implant research, etc. the brain's a type of computer at some level).  And worst case I could get a non-neuro job to pay the bills if i had a CompE degree - although I'm not sure that's the right way of thinking about this if/since my real interests are in neuroscience.What I'd like to ask you redditors is whether or not I should follow through with this degree switch, or stick it out and suffer through computer engineering and probably go to grad school for neuroscience.Idk what to do. One path would be grad school &gt; phd &gt; research, the other would be to get my grades way up and try for medical school. (I think I'd love being a medical doctor). And yet another is to tough it out through computer engineering and go from there.longer post than I expected, so **tl;dr: Stay in computer engineering? Switch to neurobiology? What do?**

I am a 22 year old electrical engineering student, and I would love to spend the rest of my life making these suits especially as I continue to learn of more high tech technologies (currently designing HUD’s better heater, GPS tracking, etc..). The Suit is more of a high tech costume than a weapon.  (I mean I wouldn’t be able to afford the insurance, or I will be dropped from the one I have, we can’t have people running around in suits). I do have MUCH bigger plans for the suits in the future, but as for now, it is a high tech costume. I’m trying to get the word out on the suit!I had posted this yesterday but got banned from the topic because of some rules I did not know about. Feel free to ask me any questions!

So few people have controllers for the PC, but it only makes sense, and I've found it so hard to find good 2 player games. Nevermind ones that work well with 3D Vision... but that's a whole 'nother discussion...
16kbt7	-20920	1358188914	dedicatedhosting	Need solid dedicated server hosting?	Hi folks, I'm the Principal Engineer at The Temple Host, right here in Reddit's hometown of Boston, and started this subreddit so we could all learn about how to make the best of dedicated hosting. So when needing solid dedicated hosting, you of course need a solid infrastructure from your host, but also a solid setup that you may be in partial control of, and I hope we can all discuss how to make the best of it all here.As for getting a solid foundation from the infrastructure of your host, as one example, you can check out our site at www.thetemplehost.com where we concentrate on speed, reliability, and really going the extra mile with support to make sure you're happy and everything is running smoothly and optimized on your servers.We just setup and optimized a vBulletin Web Server - Database Server setup for a forum with 125,000 members and 13 million posts, and it's faster than ever. I hope we can do the same for you, and share *how* we do it.Let me know here or through the site if you're in need or wondering about dedicated hosting (or any hosting for that matter) and I'll do my absolute best to give you the best impartial advice I can to meet your needs, and if we fit (we specialize in putting together custom packages), give you the best deal I can finagle for a fellow redditor.All the best!
16kbyd	-20920	1358189026	dedicatedhosting	What's your dedicated hosting setup?	Hi All! Let's start by seeing how folks have their dedicated hosting setup? What server or servers are you leasing/co-locating? Database and Web-server? Clustering? Mirroring? Backups? Curious to know how everyone is working to utilize their servers and for what purpose you're putting dedicated servers to good use.

Solaris 11.1 seems to have some problem with being a fibre-channel target, but they say it may have been fixed in S11.1 SRU 3, build 4. Of course, without a Solaris support Contract, there's no way to know. So I could spend a thousand dollars to find out, with no chance of a refund, and it could possible be worthless or... does anyone know a way to get patches to an evaluation server to test things? Any repos out there?

Or are all additional packages (latest versions) in that same repository? Things like storage-server and other packages. Not entirely familiar with Solaris and IPS, so any info is helpful, thanks  :)

9p8iw	-20925	1254249143	AskReddit	I'm looking for a PC game I used to play about ten years ago, but I have no idea what it was called. Can you help me?	The game was a PC shoot-em-up, most likely not a very good one, but I enjoyed it at the time and I've been trying to find it for years. The game was vertically scrolling, and mostly featured jet-fighter style planes to fly, and if I recall correctly, the first level was set over green grass and possibly some water (incredibly vague, I know). The pilot select screen featured all manner of, well, I'm not sure. I remember finding one of the pilots' facial position funny, though. The graphics were better than *Xevious*-era games but not great, even for the time (around 1997). I realise how vague my description is but Reddit is often great at finding these sorts of things. Thanks in advance!

It's just odd.

I played three games in a row recently where this happened.It's understandable to be frustrated with an enemy's overpowered skill combo but it's really frustrating to be forced to leave a game where you've spent time carefully choosing the perfect skills. Sometimes you require a few levels in lane before your build comes together, but by that time your team has all left.I realise it's not a serious mode, but it's just as much of a waste of our time as any other mode. It is just me, or does it happen often? How can it be handled?

I often feel like I have no idea what to do, especially if the game is really even.If teamfights are not going well I try to split-push but can never keep the lanes pushed close to their base. Is there a technique for this? Should I persist in pushing one lane, or move around the map more? Or should I just not bother and try to teamfight?Basically I find it very easy to get super farmed but can't end the game. I know people will say 'communicate with your team' which does work well in some situations but the main problem is that I have no clear idea about what we should be doing.

Hello everyone, I have a few courses here that I'm thinking about taking next quarter but not sure about all of them. These courses are all CSS electives (level 400 courses at my university).

But I'm thinking of learning how to create a databases application but I don't know what language should i choose.

gk6ph	-20945	1302122111	AskReddit	I've just found my father online. Haven't seen him in 20 years. How should I surprise him?	Hello Reddit,---When I was around 1 year old, my mother and father split up. My mother got together with my current step-father, who has brought me up as his own for the past 24 years. During my young years, my father applied for access, and I did see him when I was young. He asked if I would move in with him (200 miles away) and I said no. Not long after, due to some further court hearings, a judge denied him access to me until I was 18.It was my 25th birthday last week, and I asked my mother if she had any idea where he was. She didn't, but she did find a letter from 2003 from my grandmother, which had a postmark. At this point, I only had a few pieces of information - his name, the last known area he lived, his age, and his mother's old address.I started googling these pieces of information, querying public records, directory enquiries and other such terms. I cross referenced a bunch of nearby towns with information from Companies House, basic electoral roll searches and other such information. I also assumed that, if he had any more kids, they'd probably be on facebook. I found the name of a girl with *his* surname that attended a school relatively close to the area, and subsequently found her facebook page.I sent her a message, and confirmed my suspicions! She was indeed my sister - she knew about me, about my dad's history and a whole bunch of other information. I confirmed if the grandparents had the same names, and they did! Unfortunately, they died in the past few years, so I'll never get to meet them :(My newly-discovered sister sent me through some pictures of my dad - which was a fucking **huge** shock - I had no recollection of what he looked like, but I certainly look like him! I forwarded the picture of him to my mother, who confirmed that it was indeed him.It turns out he's on facebook, and I also have brother!---**So**, my sister is keeping this quiet for now. **How should I surprise him?** Obviously, I have a lot of questions I need answering, but I think it would be pretty special to see his reaction if I turned up unannounced. He runs a barber shop, so there's an angle for an idea...**tl;dr** I discovered my long-lost father after 2 hours on Google/Facebook. How should I surprise him?**ps** I fucking love the Internet.Edit: Thanks all - I'll give him a call today.**Update:** I called him up - as you would imagine, he was pretty darn surprised! Had a great chat, and we're meeting up soon. Thanks Reddit!
hdb80	-20945	1305634618	reddit.com	Not seen my father in 20 years. Found him via Google+Facebook. We met last night - had a beer	Last month I found my father via Google and Facebook and [asked how to surprise him](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gk6ph/ive_just_found_my_father_online_havent_seen_him/). I took the sensible advice and just called him. I hadn't seen or heard from him since I was 5 years old, so I was pleased when he was happy to meet up.It was quite strange to see somebody who actually looked like me, and was amazed at how similar we were. We ended up chugging 14 pints over a surreal but thoroughly enjoyable evening.I also learned that the family has no history of illnesses, and the ancestors have all lived into their 90s. Bonus!I'm blessed to have a fantastic relationship with my step-father, and I'm incredibly happy that everything has gone, well, better than expected.[crappy iPod photo](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/136067/random/IMG_0010.JPG)Cheers

mruys	-20945	1322473763	Android	Update: Galaxy Nexus video quality issue	It appears that the blurring and 'perspective shift' artefacts are indeed caused by the Camera software.These two videos were shot at the same time of day using the same amount of 'wobble' (me shaking the camera).1. [Using the default camera app](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoOIWUakym8&amp;hd=1)2. [Using third-party lgCamera app](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFSLnjqIssY&amp;hd=1)I have recorded the videos at 720p, as I couldn't get lgCamera to record 1080p video at a steady 24fps to compare to the default app.Both videos exhibit the 'jello effect', but that is expected with a rolling shutter.In my opinion, the quality in video 2 is MUCH better than video 1. Unfortunately, there is currently no way to disable the image stabilization in the default Camera app.

qillu	-20945	1330959341	golf	Hey r/Golf, could you give me some advice on my swing?	Hello,I've got a problem with a pretty destructive slice, which almost makes me avoid going out and playing!I picked up a few bad habits when I played as a teenager. Every time I get to the top of my swing, I find myself turning my shoulders waaaaay before the club even comes down. This usually ends up in me becoming cramped, swinging out to in, and often hitting the ball with the wrong part of the clubface.I do feel like I'm putting too much effort into actually 'hitting' the ball. I  seem to *really* turn my shoulders early. I'm too used to starting my swing with my shoulders. Anything else *feels* unnatural. How can I stop this??All of this means I don't really have a good 'arc' feeling when swinging. Sometimes I *do* get a good downswing (which still feels strange, but I can sense mid-swing when it's going well) and the ball flies perfectly straight. I have trouble replicating that.Here's a video of my 'normal' swing: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjlHlkn7T5s&amp;hd=1As you can see, I get cramped up and end up hitting the ball of the toe of the club.I've had a few lessons, but I keep reverting back to my 'old' swing.Any ideas would be much appreciated!**Edit:** Thanks all for the advice! I went to the range last night and made a significant change to my grip, rotating my left wrist clockwise and my right rist anticlockwise. I also moved the ball forward in my stance. I also concentrated on keeping my arms straighter in the backswing, and starting the downswing with my shoulders / arms before my hips. The result was most shots going straight, with only a few mild slices.

I travelled up this afternoon and got a puncture on the motorway. I changed the flat in 10 minutes (whilst swearing profusely) and got to the test centre with 5 minutes to spare! (50/50, and 60/75 for HP. The hazard perception system really is a load of bollocks - apparently I scored a 3 on one clip).Anyway - apparently the test centre in Plymouth is incredibly busy at the moment and there is no availability until 18th July (and no chance of that week as I'm away on w/c 14th).My question is - do course operators 'book up' test slots in advance? i.e. are they reserved for the courses usage? I'm trying to gauge whether the availability on the DSA site is for all tests, or whether some local courses might have slots reserved.I'd love to get a test in next week if I can.---UPDATE: After speaking with all 3 schools in Plymouth, it appears one of them has booked up every available test between now and mid-September, so he has plenty of availability and I'm booked in preliminarily for a test on 14th. Huzzah!Thanks!

Had 3 days training, and did my Mod1 immediately followed by my Mod2 today. Just a couple of minors for following distance on the dual carraigeway.I don't have any friends or colleagues that ride, so if there are any ride/meetups in Devon/Cornwall count me in :)Already tried out a few bikes:* Suzuki GSX1250FA (Edit: Now bought)* Triumph Tiger Explorer 1200* Ducati MultistradaI was surprised at how much I liked the GSX1250. I want something that can handle a 30-minute daily commute, but also handle a 3 hour journey up-country every so often.Didn't like the Explorer, but the Multistrada... wow! The acceleration on that thing nearly ripped my face off.Cheers!

For some reason I didn't want to pull up in front of him, but he spotted me and waved me through.I'd seen a few negative videos and read experiences from the US in /r/motorcycles, so this was a pleasant trip.Do you have any positive or horror stories from filtering?

Left side fairing, covers, all scratched.So annoying. It's just come back from a major service with new tyres, and now it's going to be out of use.Fortunately the culprit had left a note in the mobile pouch with a phone number and has admitted fault. Just need to go through the insurance rigmarole now.*sigh*
35xz79	-20945	1431610002	MotoUK	Insurance write off - predicament.	Following up from [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MotoUK/comments/34zf2u/my_bike_was_knocked_over_in_a_car_park/), the assessors have been on the phone and have said the bike is 'pretty much a total loss'.Quick recap, I paid just under £6K for the GSX1250 8 months ago, and it's now done 12000 miles.The assessor has given me 3 options:1. Get the bike repaired (he will authorise repair)2. Get the bike back, and they will pay £3,0003. Write it off and I will get £4,500Now, the damage was all cosmetic, and I could get away with just replacing the windscreen and mirrors, plus a clutch lever. I'd then have a bike I can hoon around (read: learn to corner properly) and won't be afraid to drop it. I'd get a £3K payout. It would then be a category-d bike.Or, I can take the £4.5K and put it towards a R1200GS or a Multistrada...What would you do?

1mx8q1	-20947	1379891814	leagueoflegends	Future of TSM Post Worlds	1) I think TSM would benefit to have Reginald step back from playing mid and be a full time manager/coach/analyst. The conceptual play from TSM was good at worlds but lacked in execution. With Reginald being a full time manager/coach/analyst, he could be a more objective presence, bring more discipline, optimize training regimes, and come up with more solid conceptual play strats.2) I see Shiphtur from team Coast being a good fit into TSM mid. Shiphtur has got a great champion pool and his mechanics are good. I see Shiphtur being able to do his part for TSM and have TSM be a bot lane focused team where Wildturtle, who did a great job at worlds, is the main carry. Since Coast's future is in question, it would be a good time for Shiphtur to change teams and Coast can have Jintae take over as their mid. With more experience and time wit TSM I see Shiphtur flourishing and becoming one of the best mids in NA. 3) With Reginald stepping back from mid and team shot caller, Xpecial would take over as the team shot caller. Xpecial has a lot of experience and stepped up during All-Stars in leading the NA team. He is fully capable of being the shot caller for TSM. 4) Based on my observations at worlds, I think Dyrus is better when he plays a tank or bruiser top as opposed to ap champs. It is less punishing for Dyrus to be taken out early as a tank or bruiser because he will still have large presence in team fights. It is harder for a ap top champ to be effective when behind. I don't think I saw Dyrus play any bruisers during the group stage. So as opposed to rumble, vlad, karthus, I think it would be better for Dyrus to be playing champs like renek, shen, nasus, zac, malph, etc. where its less punishing for him to be shutdown early. These are some points I wanted to bring up. Overall I think this would take a great deal of pressure off Reginald, who has to fulfill so many roles for the team. These changes would also optimize the team and bring more structure and discipline while still keeping the team in its chill roots. Let me know what you guys think.

2gjr85	-20981	1410864218	politicaITA	Il M5S è l' Airbnb della politica	Discutevo qualche settimana fa con un amico, *a libertarian anarchist* come si definisce lui, si parlava di peer to peer, democrazia "economica" dal basso e il ruolo che alcune startup (tipo Airbnb, Uber e similia) avrebbero nel processo.Lui sosteneva che Airbnb è un esempio di peer to peer, perchè permette ad un viaggiatore di, invece che stare in un albergo, bypassare il sistema e usare direttamente le risorse messe a disposizione da un' altra persona: Airbnb, sempre secondo lui, ha solo il ruolo di tramite e percepisce un giusto compenso per il servizio di tramite che svolge.Io gli dicevo invece che Airbnb non è un semplice tramite, bensì un *brand*: Airbnb non vende il canale, ma l' esperienza stessa, e il "vai a dormire da un' altra persona, non da un albergo" è solo un metodo per differenziarsi da una catena di alberghi. E' una catena di alberghi senza dover averne l' infrastruttura (e i costi), "noleggia" l' infrastruttura dagli utenti stessi e la vende ad altri utenti. Il concetto è lo stesso  solo che gli utenti sono non albergatori ma gente con una stanza in più da affittare - non c'è nessun peer to peer, e senza Airbnb a fungere da "ombrello" nessuna di queste interazioni avverrebbe.Se il concetto può essere inteso come un superficiale "row row fight da powah" (che bello non si passa più dalle big corporations cattive, posso andare a dormire da qualcuno come me che affitta una stanza, così non vanno più soldi alle big corporations cattive di cui sopra), l' effetto è solo quello di fare concorrenza alla piccola locanda all' angolo con 4 camere (il vero competitor di Airbnb). By design non avviene nessun contatto umano (che è un effetto collaterale assolutamente indesiderabile per Airbnb stesso), se avviene è per caso e per volontà personale sia dell' ospite che dell' ospitante. Il framework è proprietà al 100% di Airbnb, che ha potestà di rimuovere utenti come gli pare e piace, di regolare i pagamenti e le dispute. Chi cerca di uscire dal sistema e vendere i suoi servizi direttamente viene punito immediatamente e senza appello.Allo stesso modo, il M5S non è un "peer to peer", non è "uno vale uno" come pubblicizzano loro, è un ente della politica, è un partito e, marketing a parte, il concetto di fondo è lo stesso. Non c'è nessuna delega al singolo, tutte le interazioni avvengono all' interno delle regole del M5S, inappellabili e insindacabili, e nessuna delle interazioni (meetup in primis) avverrebbe fuori dal contesto del M5S.Se l' intenzione è quella di "vendere" il concetto nuovo della politica in cui ognuno è a contatto diretto con le istituzioni e il partito fa solo da tramite, assolutamente nulla all' interno del M5S è stato fatto per farlo diventare realtà - niente "piattaforma", "elezioni online" pagliacciata e chiunque osi protestare viene cacciato all' istante. L' effetto è quello di condensare tutte le opinioni di dissenso nei confronti dell' establishment in un grande calderone in cui non si riconosce più il buono dal marcio (e quindi di offrire a chi sta dall' altra parte dei bersagli facili da colpire, a la *GOMBLODDO SCIE KIMIKE GRILLINI IDIOTI*).Come nel caso di Airbnb, c'è qualcosa di positivo dietro tutto ciò, che viene usato per vendere il resto. Come nel caso di Airbnb, il cambiamento vero avverrà quando (se?) le persone in prima persona si approprieranno del concetto e costringeranno il "tramite" a farsi da parte, o lo ridurranno ad entità non più necessaria.I tempi sono maturi.

Questa era originalmente una risposta ad un commento di /u/wedhro. Si è fatta un po' lunga ed ho pensato di creare un post a parte. Qui sotto il commento originale, e [qui](http://www.reddit.com/r/politicaITA/comments/2lqxgs/bologna_scaccia_salvini_la_leganord_e_le_loro/) il link al thread:&gt; Ripeto: non sto a sindacare sulla legittimità della reazione violenta perché sulla dinamica degli eventi tu mi hai dato una versione contrastante con quella che avevo e non so ancora a quale credere, e si può sempre ipotizzare che il debole animo umano ne abbia fatta un'altra delle sue. Bona lè.&gt; Quello che metto in discussione è l'argomentazione per cui **a violenza verbale si può rispondere con violenza fisica, alla quale si aggiunge ora anche "alle azioni politiche che non si approvano si può rispondere con violenza fisica".** Se non ti va di discuterne ok, amici come prima, ma è inutile farlo solo per girare intorno alla questione che ho sollevato molti commenti fa e che ritengo dirimente, ovvero che si sta sostanzialmente cercando di legittimare il metodo fascista nella contesa politica.&gt; Non ti sto accusando di essere fascista, anche perché per me non è un'accusa, vorrei solo capire se sei consapevole che quelle argomentazioni lo sono eccome. In primis vorrei capire se per te una reazione di quel tipo è comprensibile oppure è giustificata, perché sono due cose completamente diverse.Inizio col dire che: a livello umano, la violenza è sempre brutta, la violenza è sempre sbagliata, e meno ce n'è meglio è. E' importante però precisare *a livello umano*, cioè personale. Una delle tattiche preferite dai politicantes dotati di megafono mediatico è quella, che definisco io, dello *scope creep*, ovvero: dare un contesto di un tipo ad un argomento ma indirizzare la conclusione dell' argomento verso un' altro, partendo dal primo e usandolo come cavallo di troia. Generalmente l' argomento di partenza è emozionale e personale, mentre l' argomento di destinazione è generale e statistico, e ancora una volta generalmente le "difese personali" e la capacità critica delle persone tende ad essere debole quando si tirano in ballo le emozioni e le esperienze personali. Esempio:- (politicantes al talk show, tratto da una storia vera, risposta ad uno del pubblico che chiedeva degli sprechi durante la gestione del terremoto a L'Aquila): è importante dare una risposta alla questione, sono stato nelle zone del terremoto personalmente e la sofferenza delle persone è terribile, non è possibile che lo stato abbandoni queste persone *yada yada applauso del pubblico* - argomento trascinato dal generale al personale, e sviata la risposta ricorrendo alla reazione emotiva- (altro classico): A: fare impresa in questo ambiente è difficile perchè (serie di motivazioni generali e plausibili) B: mio padre è partito dal niente e ce l'ha fatta comunque, basta rimboccarsi le maniche - i due argomenti sono paralleli, ma dall' *esterno* non si nota. A e B sono entrambe valide, se inquadrate correttamente (A a livello generale - le condizioni sono realmente difficili e B a livello personale - il padre di B ce l'ha fatta veramente). Problema è che vengono poi usate argomentazioni come B per giustificare politiche generali (vedi trickle down e supply side economics).Seguendo la linea, parliamo di violenza. Dal punto di vista personale, la violenza è brutta e cattiva, e reagire a livello personale con la violenza fisica alla violenza verbale è sbagliato e inefficace. Quindi il fatto di Salvini, se inquadrato a livello personale, è brutto e barbaro indipendentemente da chi ha "cominciato per primo", come alle elementari.Fatto è, Salvini è certo una persona e se, come detto, dal punto di vista personale se non è lui che ha "cominciato per primo" ha tutta la mia solidarietà, Salvini però in quel mentre era anche rappresentante dello stato, e come rappresentante dello stato e non come privato cittadino si è presentato sul posto (vedi scorta). Se inquadriamo la violenza come aggressione di chi è sistemicamente oppresso ad uno stato che viene, fa la voce grossa, e non tollera contestazione, la faccenda prende una cera diversa. Considerato anche che non credo che nessuno dei presenti lì abbia una ragione personale per menare Salvini (sono andati a scuola insieme? Sono vicini di casa con un conto in sospeso? Non credo. Non credo si conoscano neppure personalmente) la faccenda diventa ancora più chiara.La violenza personale è sbagliata. La violenza, quando è violenza del popolo contro lo stato o di un gruppo oppresso contro un gruppo oppressore è, se non giusta, quantomeno legittima, specie se al gruppo oppressore è stata negata qualsiasi altra espressione efficace di dissenso.Il predicare dall' alto che "la violenza è sbagliata" a prescindere non è che un tentativo di pacificare le masse che, vedendosi private dell' unico meccanismo di dissenso storicamente provato efficace contro l' oppressione dei pochi e potenti, si trovano disorientate, senza voce e senza artigli.

2nkn6i	-20981	1417090447	politicaITA	L' astensione al 60+% è una cosa buona?	l' Italiano medio è di destra/populista, ed è dovuto anche e soprattutto all' incapacità delle sinistre, che negli anni non sono state in grado di "educare" alla politica le masse - Berlusconi e adesso Renzi sono la conseguenza di questo.Se da una parte il compito non è facile, dall' altra il rinunciarvi spinge tutti quanti sempre più a fondo del baratro in cui siamo finiti. L' alta percentuale di astenuti non è una cosa buona in se e per sè, però offre un' opportunità di cambiamento per chi la volesse/sapesse raccogliere, e a sinistra al momento c'è oggettivamente il vuoto.Se (e, ripeto, siamo sempre a ipotetici qui) vi fosse una forza in grado di catalizzare il malessere politico ed economico ed allo stesso tempo veramente inclusiva e democratica dal basso, questo sarebbe il suo momento. Purtroppo il M5S non sembra essere in grado di esserlo: da una parte perchè ha fallito nel catalizzare la massa, e le colpe sono secondo me da attribuire principalmente ai media (che sono tutti contro il movimento indistintamente) ed ai due padri padroni che ai media offrono tante aperture per attaccare, e dall' altra perchè si è dimostrato che per la democrazia diretta non ci sia tanto posto all' interno del movimento - ancora una volta più a causa del "management" che di chi nel movimento ci lavora, che ha tante energie e tanto entusiasmo ma purtoppo si trova ad operare in un contesto in cui non è possibile fare più di tanto.Il mio auspicio è che quest' alta percentuale di astensione si trasformi in una consapevolezza politica al più presto. La lotta fra poveri è ai massimi storici e la lotta di classe ai minimi. Il terreno è fertile sia per le destre populiste (che hanno dimostrato nel passato e nel presente di saper interpretare il disagio popolare molto meglio delle sinistre "snob") che per un' opera di repressione ancora più severa da parte del potere costituito, che non deve più temere un' eventuale opposizione "organizzata" e può usare la violenza come arma di controllo contro le poche opposizioni militanti, isolate dalla popolazione (loro potenziale "base") e dagli stessi riferimenti di "sinistra" all' interno del sistema.
2pvnj2	-20981	1419075431	politicaITA	Maxiemendamenti in bianco	Leggo ora che ieri (notte) è stata posta e votata la fiducia alla riscrittura (pardon "maxiemendamento") della finanziaria (pardon "legge di stabilità").Parlare di riscrittura non credo sia neppure tecnicamente corretto, visto che ampie parti sono state lasciate in bianco per essere completate ex post dal governo... la dittatura (pardon "legge delega") sembra essere la moda del 2015.La stampa [al solito compiacente](http://tg24.sky.it/tg24/politica/2014/12/19/legge_stabilita_misure_maxiemendamento.html) non sa più che supercazzole inventarsi per cercare di nascondere la truffa. Sempre sotto Natale ste cose, l' anno scorso la FIAT che scappa coi giornali a dire "grande colpo del colosso italiano [sic]", quest' anno il "maxiemendamento" che è per metà una delega in bianco al governo e per l' altra metà l' ennesimo regalo alle banche e alle clientele (pardon "un *credito di imposta per compensare l'aumento della tassazione*").Sulla rivoluzione armata non ci conto più tanto. Mi aspettavo almeno un quid di reazione da parte di chi vive qui e queste cose le deve subire. Ma la juve ha vinto l' anticipo ieri e gioca l' intercontinentale col napoli settimana prossima, ci sono cose più importanti di cui discutere.Il solito in bocca al lupo a tutti voi che rimanete...

2sm05t	-20981	1421395976	politicaITA	Perchè è importante lo sgancio del franco dall' euro?	Il franco fisso a 1.2 era una dichiarazione di fiducia da parte della Svizzera nei confronti dell' Euro e dell' unione. Sganciare il cambio adesso (prima del QE e delle elezioni in Grecia) vuol dire accettare perdite anche sostanziali adesso pur di poter saltar giù da una barca che (secondo i fatti della politica di Zurigo) è destinata ad affondare. La decisione sul QE sarà presa il 22 di questo mese... *tre giorni prima* delle elezioni in Grecia. C'è chi sostiene che i mercati e la politica siano indipendenti - è davvero difficile pensarla così dopo questa. Sta di fatto che se la Svizzera effettua una mossa del genere (che ripeto è estremamente onerosa) un motivo c'è - nessuno in Europa ha più *inside information* delle banche svizzere.Cosa cambia per l' Italia? Per il momento, poco. Il vento che tira però non promette niente di buono. L' operazione di Zurigo ha avuto un impatto internazionale assolutamente non giustificato dall' entità dei capitali in movimento dalal Svizzera - l' Euro ha perso su tutte le monete in maniera sostanziale, anche contro per esempio la corona norvegese in crisi nera per i prezzi bassi del petrolio.Il segnale del mercato (quello vero stavolta, non quello che piazza la bomba sotto la borsa di Atene per manovrare le elezioni) è che l' Euro questa volta non riesca a tenere. Se questo fosse il caso le conseguenze per gli stati coinvolti sarebbero disastrose - l' Euro che collassa senza "rompersi" è lo scenario di exit peggiore per l' Italia.Sulla stampa l' unica analisi che leggo è "bene per i frontalieri"...
2sx2ua	-20981	1421656561	politicaITA	Chi ha paura del voto in Grecia?	
2tia6g	-20981	1422102155	politicaITA	Inflazione, deflazione, QE e lungo periodo	In risposta a "La crisi della modica quantità", e specie a questo frammento:&gt; La deflazione rappresenta quindi un problema, anche perché aumenta le retribuzioni reali senza che i lavoratori dipendenti debbano muovere un dito.Tecnicamente è vero. Ma c'è di più.Perchè le banche non vogliono la deflazione? La vogliono eccome, come la vogliono logicamente tutti i grandi capitali. Spiegazione da ELI5: con la deflazione al 2%, se io ho 10 euro e la banca ne ha 1 miliardo, a fine anno io ne ho guadagnati 2... e la banca 20 milioni. Con l' inflazione io ne perdo 2, ma la banca perde di fatto 20 milioni. E la banca, che generalmente di soldi non ne vuole perdere tanti, deve attivarsi e cercare di investirli a tassi almeno più alti dell' inflazione se non vuole perderci. Mentre con la deflazione tutto quello che deve fare il capitale è *aspettare*. Questa logica vale allo stesso modo se vi sono investimenti "sicuri" maggiori dell' inflazione, e vale doppio se questi investimenti sicuri sono preclusi a chi ha poco capitale (avete provato ad andare a chiedere BTP a breve termine nel 2012? Io sì, mi hanno detto "quelli non ce li abbiamo ma se vuoi abbiamo questi bei BOT a 10 anni al 3%". No grazie). Investire nel 2015 è un gioco per chi ha molti capitali che, puntando su tutto, può guardare al ritorno medio e non "tentare la fortuna" puntando su un solo cavallo.Allora perchè il QE?Primo: c'è una ratio politica che, per quanto l' interpretazione dei fatti da parte dei media sia e debba sempre essere economica (la politica è vecchia e superata, l' economia muove il mondo, questo è il mantra), è vera, è influente e nel breve termine si chiama Grecia. Questo QE sembra cucito su misura per la Grecia che, nel caso si decida a mandare a quel paese la Troika, perderebbe dalla sera alla mattina gli "aiuti" che tengono la suo economia in vita. Ma, se invece decidesse di "comportarsi bene" e farsi commissarriare adesso come prima, gli aiuti arriverebbero puntuali a Febbraio.Economicamente, quantomeno sul breve periodo, la scelta per la Grecia è scontata: staccare la spina della Troika manderebbe la Grecia dritta nel terzo mondo dalla sera alla mattina. E pochi greci, anche chi vota per Tsipras, credo vogliano finire ad aver fame e aver sete - indipendentemente da che cosa questa scelta comporti per il lungo periodo. Questo dà di fatto alla BCE il potere di decidere del destino greco comodamente da Bruxelles (o Francoforte?). I greci di fatto non hanno scelta, e il voto di domani (a meno di soprese che tutti ci auguriamo ma che sono oggettivamente improbabili) non avrà effetti pratici per il futuro della Grecia e dell' eurozona... appunto a causa di questo QE dal tempismo perfetto e dalle clausole stranamente tagliate su misura per evitare qualsiasi tipo di "ribellione" Greca alla Troika.Secondo: i banchieri sono avidi, sono senza scrupoli ma di certo non sono stupidi, e sanno bene che cosa succede al loro giocattolo quando l' eurozona salta per aria. Tutti sapevano già nel 2001 che l' euro non è sostenibile senza politiche correttive strutturali e "automatiche" - ovvero, non l' elemosina agli stati, che neppure elemosina è, elargita ogni tanto per tenere in vita il sistema, ma un sistema legalmente vincolante di trasferimenti e di politiche economiche e fiscali comuni in tutta l' eurozona. Le contrattazioni su questo QE sono state solo ed esclusivamente fra Troika e governo tedesco, e ne è uscito come prevedibile un "finto" QE che non intacca gli interessi tedeschi ma di fatto lega con lo spago l' europa ancora per un paio d' anni.Cosa succede dopo Marzo 2016 (o, come prevedibile, molto prima) se questa operazione è inefficace e l' inflazione è ancora allo 0.x, il debito greco al 200% e il debito italiano al 160%? Sostanziamente, niente - si fa un altro QE, o un' altra LTRO, ed agli stati in sofferenza si ripropone la scelta fra libertà o sopravvivenza. Il prezzo da pagare per le banche è minimo, soprattutto perchè (come da clausola) le perdite delle banche nazionali in caso di svalutazione verranno ripagate dagli stati nazionali che, per finanziare l' operazione, aumenteranno tasse e taglieranno servizi - e quindi in sostanza l' operazione è già ora finanziata dal contribuente, solo che non lo sa perchè nessuno glielo spiega e non ne sente gli effetti immediatamente.Come si esce da questa trappola? Boh! Nel senso che tutte le parti coinvolte sono talmente dentro questo giro che uscirne sarebbe talmente doloroso da essere impensabile... Germania compresa - se l' euro si rompe e i debiti non vengono "pagati" chi ci perde in Germania non sono le banche (che hanno già "realizzato" il loro capitale comprando immobili e proprietà) ma chi ha i soldi nei fondi pensione e nei fondi comuni - ovvero (indovina che strano) la gente che si sveglia la mattina a andare a lavorare si trova senza pensione e senza risparmi dalla mattina alla sera. Si accettano suggerimenti.

Giubilo! Il tesoro rientra del principale e si ciuccia anche un bel po' di succosi interessi. Vittoria per il popolo lavoratore quindi?Magari. Problema è che il principale non viene da eventuali vendite di immobilizzazioni di MPS effettuate per riuscire a ripianare il debito contratto. Il principale viene *da un altro debito* che MPS contrae, [stavolta con la BCE](http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2015/05/13/monte-dei-paschi-via-libera-della-bce-alla-ricapitalizzazione-da-3-miliardi/1680814/). Quindi, cosa è successo? Lo stato presta soldi a MPS, la BCE presta soldi a MPS, se semplifichiamo quest' equazione rimuovendo il MPS che sta al denominatore da una parte e dall' altra, cosa otteniamo?Otteniamo che *la BCE ha prestato soldi allo stato*. Ovvero? *Lo stato ha contratto debito pubblico*. Il MPS agisce solo da intermediario.Quello che succede a lungo termine è che MPS continua a fare debito, a un certo punto ha di nuovo bisogno di un salvataggio pubblico ed il gioco reinizia da capo.Ma uno può dire "ma a noi checcefrega, è la BCE che paga, MPS ci perde ma è un istituto privato, lo stato ci guadagna alla fine perchè ha ricevuto gli interessi nel frattempo". Il che ci porta a chiederci: ma alla BCE, *chi glieli dà sti soldi da prestare a tassi di interesse infimi*?La BCE li stampa, indirettamente tramite LTRO e QE vari. Ma stampare a nastro senza corrispettivo farebbe aumentare l' inflazione. E l' inflazionenon aumenta in eurozona, anzi. Perchè? Perchè la BCE è [capitalizzata costantemente tramite i governi degli stati membri](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fondo_europeo_di_stabilit%C3%A0_finanziaria). Quindi, l' LTRO e QE che in situazioni ordinarie farebbero aumentare l' inflazione non lo fanno perchè a corrispettivo alla BCE entrano costantemente fondi "salva stati", finanziati indirettamente dal contribuente.E tutti gli interessi su questi debiti sono un sifone che va indirettamente dalle tasche di chi si sveglia la mattina a andare al lavoro ai banchieri.Come si rompe questo circolo? La prossima volta che MPS fallisce, la "ricapitalizzazione" facciamo che non avvenga tramite un "prestito", ma tramite una nazionalizzazione. La capite adesso la differenza? Che di /u/ciube che si ciucciano la propaganda di regime purtroppo è pieno il mondo...

Ma sto divagando.Il popolo Greco ha deciso e il popolo greco pagherà (carissimo) l' epilogo di questo tira e molla finanziario fra mangiasoldi greci e e mangiasoldi tedeschi che, nel bene o nel male, è giunto al termine oggi.Il problema è che questo epilogo, se non gestito con lungimiranza dalla politica tedesca, rischia davvero di far esplodere una bomba che può spazzare via l' euro, l' europa unita e quasi 70 anni di pace nel continente europeo.Se la Merkel anche lei dice no il rischio di un contagio è enorme. Se la Merkel dice sì alla controproposta, ci risiamo fra 6 mesi al massimo. L' unica, vera, soluzione sarebbe una cancellazione di tutto o gran parte del debito greco, e a seguire un ripensamento profondo sulle regole dell' euro e della finanza in generale. La cosa brutta è che (assunto che alla soluzione "vera" non ci pensa nessuno neanche di striscio) chi ci perde e chi ci perderà sono i greci e i tedeschi che lavorano, e chi ci ha guadagnato sono i greci e i tedeschi che non lo fanno.L' italia è il prossimo.
g0az7	-20992	1299658192	leagueoflegends	I just heard the funniest shit ever on CLG Stream. bigfatjiji + manyreason = comedy gold.	And here I though it was funny to hear hotshotgg + manyreason. Bigfat and manyreson should have their own odd couple show. That stream would seriously get views. Not only that, but I predict the one-liners, and the mannerisms they say them in would fucking sell t-shirts, and shit. No joke, I have never been more proud of ESL as an asian than hearing those 2 go at it. Did anyone capture that stream? CLG, seriously have jiji stream with manyreason for 1 hour each night. Put that shit on your website and I guarantee you will get hits.edited for punctuation...Edit below is more detail on what happened last night.This is one of those you had to be there moments but I will do the best I can. Leading up to this hotshotgg was trying to make 2300 world first and take #1 away from a lilac. He did so, and was #1 but not by much. So as I started stream he queued in to a game as kakasoul. Then everybody else queues. Next thing I know #1 troll manyreason is on and taunting HS as usual. He ends up getting queue with bigfat and "a lilac". I had never heard manyreason troll bigfat so this is where the hilarity begins. Bigfat gives no quarter, and the trash starts flying. Besides the usuall "your nub", throw in death threats, a game of chicken, and bigfatjiji actually agitated (typically he is very subdued this might be partly due to the fact he is chinese and many is korean but this is my pet theory). Anyway while all this is going on hotshot is facing losing #1 spot becuase as we learn bigfat is on "a lilac's" team (HS tells him to not troll but not try hard). Manyreason was in that game against bigfat and "a lilac" this is the first time I have ever heard hotshot give manyreason any sort of encouragement. During the while match HS is losing his game where as kakasoul his "back is so very big" but apparently not big enough. As I type this I realize how much of a fanboy I am but I dont care. I do not watch much TV so this is about as good as it gets for me.TL:DR you guys needed to be there, for all who were we can only hope for lightning to strike 2x times.

I had a bit of an epiphany just now about how I think we could move the masses towards a better League experience.Here is my proposal to keep honor relevant. When you honor someone after a game your honor helps them gain bonus IP. The different honor categories will be weighted differently, so helpful or teamwork would be weighted a bit more than friendly. Riot wold work out the values I am here to spark a discussion. Oh also to avoid people boosting IP, you can only honor people that you did not queue with for IP. For people you queued with you can still honor them but they will not get the bonus IP associated with that.Even though it seems like reporting and the tribunal works I think we could make this better. It seems like Riot is limited to bans for the stick. Sometimes the stick can come too late. Often times when there is a troll, the team knows. To that end Riot could put a system in place where if more than 2 members of your team reports you your IP for that match is reduced. If all 4 members of your team reports you you get no IP for the match. You can appeal the decision if you want and if the Tribunal grants you your appeal you get your IP back. This would work the same way for your oppenents. If 3 or more of your opponents report you you would get reduced IP and if 5 report you you would get no IP. You could still appeal. The logic for 3 or more opponents is due to the adversarial nature of the origins of the report.TL:DRHonor and Reporting would have direct consequences with the IP rewards at the end of games. This would impact everyone in an immediate way and encourage an overall better atmosphere for League games.Edit for general things

Realisticly I think we can come out 2-2. If we come out 3-1 I will be thrilled. 1-3 will bring me back to Season 3 reality. I don't even want to think about a 4-0 weekend.All I can say is even if we lose as long as we go down fighting like men I will be happy. GO GO GO CLGGGGGG!!!!1111111edit: new emphasis applied to tsm hateedit 2: for da pg-13sedit 3:CLG I am glad we were able to take the 2 games from the lower teams. We just need to start getting things shaped up vs the top teams. I saw lots of small mistakes. I think double went on tilt on the C9 game. He has to cut that out.

I didnt watch game 3 but for checking in once....We need to not be too down. We still want 3rd place. Let's kick some curse ass and call it a split!OK so we won 2-0 vs Curse I am watching the VODs now. Overall I think CLG did a good job. It is obvious we have made great gains since last split. I am a huge CLG fan but I think right now we are just a touch below TSM and C9. I think if we continue to improve as we have been we can be on par with them next split.

I am using a Blackwidow 2012 on OS X and for the most part I don't have any issues with the basic functions. But for the advanced functions like that menu key which does nothing I want to see if OS X is registering the input. I want nothing to do with Synapse 2.0 so that will not be something I want to pursue. Thanks for your time.01212015 Edit: See the updated results belowThanks to /u/intelli78's tip I installed Karabiner and used the Event Viewer.

For the keys that do things I will order custom WASD keys to reflect those changes. Thanks much for all the help /r/MechanicalKeyboards ! This helps me calm my OCD.

2wa2g0	-20992	1424234779	MechanicalKeyboards	Cherry PBT Keycaps&gt;Razer BW Ones	Fellow rmkers I did not know what all the fuss about keycaps had been until I made the change. It is like driving a lexus after driving a less luxurious car for a long time. The look and feel are night and day. I am in love with my keyboard all over again.Here is the best part. I ebayed the keyboard a Cherry G80-8200LPBUS/04 for the Clear and plain numpad keys. Turns out all the keys were better. So I got a new almost full keycaps, I got my clear key for my now OS X keyboard, and bonus I got 100+ MX Clears I can harvest for a future project (undecided 40%).By the way is it me or are MX Clears not all that? I thought they would be so very different from browns (what I am using now) but they were not that different from what I could tell.Anyways I just had to share my excitement. Happy clacking out there!

I got MX Browns and the clacking reminds me of tapping on a block of wood or something. It is pretty sweet. I got a honey colored Warmaster for the Insert key and a GMK escape. I don't think there is any more I can improve on this right now. I even love the keycaps it came with. I just want you all to know, I figured no one else would understand.As a side note. I get the whole Poker II thing now. This keyboard has very simple Fn layer. I think the reason to get a poker vs this would be how complicated you want your layers to be.Happy clacking!edit: I have noticed my Capslock LED key to be inconsistant. Anybody else have that problem?

I am trying to make the keycaps as standard as possible. The FN key would be regular function layer. The Super key would be a poker 2 like access. I tried to retain the arrow keys like the Leopold while adding the one hand home/end page up/down that is possible. A nod to HHKB for capslock removal.

Cant play any large scale close quarters map without some dbag going 40-2 in a corner with airburst or sitting at a door with c4. Airburst is the EXACT same thing as USAS frag rounds was at its peak in bf3, but oh wait lets give them an ammo box to sit on. WTF!?!?!? Lets let them replenish it right away too. Airburst is only useful for spamming stairs and its by far OP when some scrub sits in a metro pub for 3 hours and goes 400-20. What were you thinking dice? Jesus christ i cant wait for hardline. This game is aids.

Nobody misses there shots and there is no skill gap at all. I know casuals will love this and its more inviting to new players but its not fun at all. Aim assist is so strong it will catch people on the other side of walls. And no we dont need an auto rotation on/off setting, aim assist needs a range cap and it needs to be toned down at least 25%. This game is too easy for everybody. Theres no satisfaction in killing people on console. Honestly think Xim users are at a disadvantage.

3b4u3a	-20998	1435276390	BF_Hardline	When using tracers you do less damage, and some weapon damage models have changed.	Just tested in a server with a buddy after someone on twitch yesterday told me tracers do less damage. I dont know the exact numbers on all weapons but on M416/M16 it does a max damage of 23, id say that it is fair to say it takes away 4 max damage on every weapon which means AKM will now be a 4 shot kill up close... that was kind of an odd number (23) so i took off tracers to make sure they both still do 28 max damage, and they dont. They now do 27 max. So a slight nerf that isnt really noticable but also something we werent told about. Test it for yourself and you will see the same results. But headshot max damage for both M16/M416 is 56, which would be double the pre patch max damage (28). Things just arent adding up. Im curious to know what else has changed. Not a chopper pilot but my buddy is and he sais TTK is noticeably longer to him on infantry. On PS4 by the way if that makes any difference. Minimum damage is still the same for m16/m416 at 18 also.
3b7rxw	-20998	1435340026	BF_Hardline	Conspiracy Theory- Visceral is trying to make Dice look good by messing the game up more	Think about it. Think about all the resources DICE left Visceral to use. I played BF4 yesterday (albeit boring somewhat) and the netcode is amazing now. Everything feels so fluent. I went back to hardline and grenades on the other sides of walls were killing me... Also with all the issues Hardline has been having only leads me to believe EA had a MUHAUHAUHAU moment and said "ok visceral we have payed you, now make this game awful to make dice look good." Anything is possible when it comes to money, and i doubt visceral will ever focus on another FPS like hardline or battlefield again. Just seems like EA realizes the potential of Battlefront and other future DICE BF games and wants to make DICE look as good as possible. BF4 is flourishing now and Hardline is dwindling. Just a conspiracy theory but what if?

Vendor provided Cisco 1941 routers (x.x.x.1) that we cannot access, but the vendor will make config changes we request.* All facilities have a backup line (cable modem mostly) that is connected to a Cisco 2911 router (x.x.x.2) with security bundle.  Backup line is being used for guest wireless at the moment.* Datacenter has two internet lines coming into an ASA 5520. All Internet traffic is being routed out the primary interface.* Datacenter core switch is a Cisco 4506-e. MPLS traffic enters an interface on this switch.I need a solution that will automatically fail over the connection from facility to datacenter when the MPLS line drops traffic, and automatically switch back when the MPLS line is available again. I've been looking at IPSLA and weighted routes in the core switch, and VPN tunnels between the 2911 routers and the secondary interface on the ASA with VRRP running on the two facility routers, but I am more of a sysadmin than a network engineer and want to make sure I am implementing the best solution. Can anyone give me some pointers?

1ryax1	-21036	1386030125	DotA2	Unusual Standard Courier	So; a small idea that I've recently thought of is a base courier Valve could sell in the store with premade slots for unusual Gems (no gems of course, just the spaces) which would look exactly like the standard courier [donkey]. I personally have a few gems id like to at least see instead of just having them siting in my inventory and is a unique way to market something they already have. Model and effects are all accounted for ; I'd be willing to spend up to 10$ for a courier like this, and im sure others would be to! 
1u9m24	-21036	1388704154	DotA2	[Tiny Rant] So yeah, I'm tired of people not speaking the language they queue for.	It never bothered me so much before today; in the past 10 pub games I've played, a solid 65% of the players did not speak the language they queued for and uttered less than: XXXXXXX NOOB, XXXXXXXX OP in 'English'.I'll usually report them and move on with my life, but seriously, I'm queueing for the language I'd like to speak in game. LF&gt;better place to post this than just reddit because my last straw has been bent and i can no longer suck the wonderfull juices that are dota through it...

27u7v2	-21036	1402449849	DotA2	PSA: Get rid of your boar for about ~$1.50	You'll need a few things: 2-3 other trash mythical rarities you do not wish to keep (I used Genuine Valor Huds for 19 cents each on the market)1 Polymorph Mythical Items Recipe (without specific requirements)You'll obviously put the boar in with the mythicals and craft a new, albeit untradable, mythical item (possibly another boar.)So why is this important?I've seen on reddit several times complaints about seeing that ugly untradeable boar in their random courier option, looking for a way to get rid of it, or even disable it. So, until then this is, as far as I know, the easiest way to do it until valve pushes a disable option.inb4 complaints on paying money on a video game: If you've enough couriers to shuffle them, you can sell the ones you don't absolutely need. If this matters that much to you, you'll probably pay the low price :PFor those asking about the results of my polymorph, Captain Bamboo

She's now on a brazilian account that's 22 months old.I think premium glitched and autokicked my fifth pet (I had 5 at the time) since nothing else is missing from my account and use my pin for everything. No message from TNT about it though, so I submitted a ticket in hopes of her ressurection.[Link for memorial](http://www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=Myalternatepersona)

Of course they said no, but at least at the gamestop i was at, they were taking names+phone numbers and informed me that when they were put into their system they would call before opening that day to take my preorders.

3d260w	-21036	1436740575	Mabinogi	You're responsible for the creation of two new races:	What do you choose and why?Things to include:* Appearance vs humans. Size, characteristics; go wild.* What skills do they specialize in?* Where are the home towns of these beings? How does it relate to their designs?* How are their stat growths? Is it in any way symbolic of the race?You can make it a race already in the game such as goblins or kobolds, or you can be completely original!

The dust required to create it is super low in comparison to face hunter. The deck seems to require no luck based on rng outside of drawing a few cards. Does it have a place in the meta? Can it be used to ladder quickly? Will it be effective when TGT comes out?Decklist: http://teamarchon.com/decks/view/61-toke-me-out-to-italyWhat's everyones opinion on it?Small edits below:Decks hes beaten:&gt;Some warrior (died before seeing anything of indication) x2&gt;Legend warrior? x2&gt;Some rogue (see above)&gt;Zoolock x2&gt;Tempo mage (no tempo)&gt;Facehunter&gt;Dragon mage&gt;Normal druid (turn 4 concede, no drops or afk)Lost against:&gt;Some facehunter (got a malorne)&gt;Normal druid x2&gt;Handlock (rekt by shadowflame)Done watching for now, he's gone from about 120 legend to 20 legend using the deck, as of right now.

LINK TO THE BUILD: [http://pcpartpicker.com/p/PHv8xr](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/PHv8xr)I've been lurking on this sub for a while and though about trying to build the cheapest machine I can. Just graduated college so not alot of cashflow at the moment.I've tried playing TF2 on my 6-year-old Vista laptop and struggling to get it to 5 fps when there's more than 2 players on screen.Would this build be able to play games like TF2, CS:GO, and Minecraft at reasonable FPS and graphics?Couple things:I have 4GB RAM in my laptop right now that I am willing to rip out and install on this build.I have a Windows Vista CD for an operating system, or i could throw a SteamOS on it. I have a screen, mouse, and keyboard as well.I'm really just trying to see what the minimum amount I can spend on a computer that could actually play games at reasonable specs.

He then asked me why I had chosen a full tower and what I would need the extra space for, when I could fit the same components in a mid tower. I had originally chosen the case because I liked the look of it but then questioned myself and asked "Why do I need the extra space?" So buildapc I'm going to consult you. Is there any reason why someone would need a full tower over a mid tower and vice versa.

I do not have iFile, OpenSSH, or anything that has the ability to modify system files, so I'm pretty sure I didn't accidentally screw anything up.

1yemv3	-21125	1392865322	stunfisk	WP Dragonite, Espeon, Gallade... now what?	I'm very new to team-building. I only have a basic idea of what I want. I think more than anything, I'd like suggestions to help me learn more about team building...Dragonite (M) @ Weakness PolicyAbility: MultiscaleEVs: 252 Spd / 252 Atk / 4 HPAdamant Nature- Dragon Dance- Dragon Claw- Earthquake- Fire PunchI saw a post the other day about Weakness Policy Dragonite. I've kinda always wanted to use one, so I figured this is a good opportunity. The one thing that was critical to the success of this set is keeping rocks off of the field, thus...VVEspeon (F) @ Choice SpecsAbility: Magic BounceEVs: 252 Spd / 252 SAtk / 4 HPTimid Nature- Psychic- Dazzling Gleam- Hidden Power [Fire]- Heal BellI have used Magic Bounce Espeon on nearly all of my teams this gen, in varying forms. Magic Bounce deters hazard use altogether (nearly), and I successfully bounce a lot of burns, toxics, and TWaves with her. Not positive about the item, but she hits HARD with the specs. Hidden Power Fire is kinda leftover from another team where I needed Fire coverage, but I also find that it makes Espeon the perfect counter to Ferrothorn.VVGallade (M) @ Assault VestAbility: JustifiedEVs: 252 Atk / 4 HP / 252 SDefAdamant Nature- Psycho Cut- Close Combat- Ice Punch- Poison JabMy all-time favorite pokemon. Sadly, I don't feel like he holds up in OU all that well. I decided the best way to make him useful is to work with his pretty good SpDef stat and Assault Vest him with 4 attacks. Picking those 4 attacks was hard. I feel like all of these could change to fit coverage needs. I suspect that I might need Drain Punch over CC to get him some kind of healing help.VVSo that's where I am so far. I have little (no) team building experience, but I'd like to start with these 3. I am willing to make changes to their sets, however.I would really like recommendations as to pokemon that help fill out missing roles on this team, pokemon that compliment the ones that I have and pokemon that cover weaknesses.Really I just want to learn from your recommendations, so don't be shy!...(P.S. Some pokemon I really like / are interested in are Cloyster, Breloom, Greninja, Aegislash, and Zoroark. Also, I have no clue what to do about a Mega. I miss MegaKang so, so much. Probably because I'm a scrub.)

OK, I know I'm not the only one in this situation, but search didn't yield what I was looking for.I want to transfer ~21 full boxes of pokemon from White to Y. Basically I'm transferring my Living Dex for Gen 1-5.So the process is this-  * Open PokeTransporter (with Pokemon White cart inserted) * Upload 30 Pokemon from Box 1 to Pokemon Bank Transport Box * Quit PokeTransfer, insert Pokemon Y cart * Open Pokemon Bank * Copy the Transport Box to the associated Box in Y where I want those pokes to be housed * Save/Quit, Insert Pokemon White, **Move 30 pokemon from another box, one by one, into the now empty Box 1**, Save/Quit * Repeat from Step 1The part in **bold** is the part that is killing me. From what I can tell, there's no way to make PokeTranporter look at anything other than Box 1, and there's no way in Pokemon White to mass transfer Pokemon from box to box like there is in X/Y.Does anybody have any tips for speeding this process up? Particularly the slow process of manually moving 30 pokemon multiple boxes away so they can be transported. Any helpful tips would be greatly appreciated!..If not, well then I understand why we get 30 days for free ;)

1zxzef	-21125	1394338694	stunfisk	[RMT] Almost a Green Team - Gallade, Gardevoir, Espeon, Dragonite, Aegislash, &amp; Cloyster	I'll start by saying that I'm not new to Pokémon, but I am basically new to competitive battling in Gen VI. I have stumbled around on Showdown, having more success with teams that I liked less and less. I was struggling to find a balance between using pokemon I like (important to me, I know it's not important to everyone) and pokemon that are at least competitively viable. My favorite pokemon before Gen IV was Gardevoir, and when Gallade came around he became my favorite by mile. I was messing around one night and decided to try and make a team that revolves around them, and the resulting team has actually been pretty successful on Showdown, as well as a lot of fun for me to play.---Gallade (M) @ Assault VestAbility: JustifiedEVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SDefAdamant Nature- Zen Headbutt- Drain Punch- Earthquake- Shadow SneakI decided the best way to make Gallade work in OU is to take advantage of his Special Bulk. He is fairly straightforward. I switch him in when I'm threatened by a special attack, tank the hit, and then wreck with Drain Punch / EQ. Drain Punch really helps with his survivability and nobody expects EQ. Many a Heatran have lamented the day they tried to muscle through this guy. Is he the best at what he does? Absolutely not, but he's my favorite so I don't worry about it. Flying attacks are his main concern. Most ghost attackers are special AND he can get in pre-emptively with Shadow Sneak. Talonflame scares Gallade, but as you'll see, Talonflame scares most of my team.---Gardevoir (F) @ GardevoiriteAbility: SynchronizeEVs: 252 HP / 252 SAtk / 4 SDefModest Nature- Hyper Voice- Psyshock- Shadow Ball- Calm MindThe attacks seem to be pretty standard for Gardevoir. The EV spread was the "suggested spread" on Showdown. I questioned the lack of speed at first, but tbh it hasn't been much of an issue. As far as Megas go, I know she isn't great, but she has done a fine job of eating Fighting and Dragon physical attacks, and her Special Bulk is, again, impressive. If I can get one Calm Mind in, she can actually be a pretty reliable sweeper so long as some faster checks have already been eliminated. She usually comes out in the late-game for me.---Espeon (F) @ Choice SpecsAbility: Magic BounceShiny: YesEVs: 4 HP / 252 SAtk / 252 SpdTimid Nature- Psychic- Dazzling Gleam- Hidden Power [Fire]- Signal BeamI have fallen in love with this thing in Gen VI. Bouncing hazards and statuses force so many forfeits and rage quits. WP Dragonite (below) really needs rocks to stay off the field, so that is priority #1 with Espeon. The mind games are exhilarating. Generally, people don't even try for rocks/spikes because they're afraid of having them bounced. Pokemon that consistently lead with willowisp and T-wave get those bounced as well.As far as the rest of the set, I prefer an attacking set as opposed to a dual screens or cleric Espeon. I just feel like she doesn't have the survivability to really make either of those approaches worth it. What she does have is respectable speed and a whopping 130 base SpAtk. With Specs, she gets lots of surprise kills every now and then. HP Fire is a joy - it makes this Espeon the perfect Ferrothorn counter (bounces everything and OHKOs). It's also great against Scizors who try to Swords Dance or who Bullet Punch at full health.I'm well aware that that was 3 Psychic types in a row. Because of their secondary types, Gallade and Gardevoir don't technically have a weakness to Dark, but Dark types are still a concern for this team. Everytime Espeon gets Pursuit-ed on an attempted switch, I die a little inside.---Dragonite (M) @ Weakness PolicyAbility: MultiscaleShiny: YesEVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 SpdAdamant Nature- Dragon Dance- Dragon Claw- Earthquake- Extreme SpeedI saw this set here on Stunfisk, and it's incredible. Come in on a free switch (almost always after a death), tank a super-effective move while Dragon Dancing, and sweep with 2.5x Atk and 1.5x Speed. I opt for Extremespeed over Fire Punch, and I can't count the number of times I've been thankful for that. There's just too much priority in this meta to not take advantage of this opportunity. Specially-oriented fairies can still be OHKOd by a x2.5 Extremespeed. This guy is very reliable, but things to look out for are Mamoswine (OHKO even with Multiscale) and already boosted dragons.---Aegislash (M) @ Leftovers (here begins the "not green" part of my team)Ability: Stance ChangeShiny: YesEVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SDefBrave NatureIVs: 0 Spd- Shadow Sneak- Sacred Sword- Swords Dance- King's ShieldYeah it's the standard physical set. I have a shiny in-game with these specs, so that's why I'm sticking with this. Again, the mind games are terrific. Normally, I get a Swords Dance or two and then go to town. I can't decide between Leftovers and Air Baloon. I like the EQ immunity, but also I can get some respectable healing done by mixing in some Kings Shields now and then.Things to look out for are burns and Talonflame, who seems to usually OHKO with Flare-Blitz, and has priority to follow up if not. If I SD and an Earthquaker comes in, sometimes I'll just switch to Dragonite and decide to come back with Aegi later.---Cloyster (F) @ Focus SashAbility: Skill LinkShiny: YesEVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 SpdNaive Nature- Icicle Spear- Rock Blast- Ice Shard- Shell SmashI love Cloyster as a lead. If I sense hazards or status (looking at you, Pranksters), I switch to Espeon to bounce. If my opponent leads a special attacker, I switch to Gallade or Gardevoir. Anything else, Shell Smash and get ready to rock. I used to run White Herb to negate the defensive losses, but Focus Sash has served me better. If I still have it full health at the end-game, I can count on it to take a chunk of health off of anything that isn't Steel typed, and even kill dragons unboosted.Things to look out for are Steel types and Special Attackers. Once I find a safe place to insert Cloyster into the match and Shell Smash, things usually start to tilt my way.Cloyster is my ONLY line of defense against a Talonflame. If I see one on the other team, I'll usually lead something else and keep it simply to deal with that threat. It'll take ~50% and then kill with Rock Blast.---So there you have it. I feel like this was awfully wordy but hopefully more details is better than less details. This team struggles if Espeon gets taken out early, so good prediction is vital to my success. I love Cloyster/Aegislash/Dragonite, because they all can pretty reliably boost themselves without needing much help from their teammates.Please feel free to comment, criticize etc. I know this team isn't going to win me a world championship any time soon, but it's fun as hell to play, and I'm excited to share it with you!

I love the comments 95% of the time as I get to learn about different team situations, players etc. However, some people are so disrespectful to others that it creates a very toxic environment and upsets readers like myself. This isn't me crying about not getting what I want, rather I would like to see everyone freely giving their opinion and experiences without getting trashed by dozens of people for doing so. Most of my gripes come from people not believing what people have done and discrediting them without knowing who they are and what they've done. If someone says they played CB at nine years old, let them say it. You don't know where they played soccer as a child and have no right to discredit their own life experiences.Also, if someone has an opinion about a player from which they've formed by watching that said player or team, let them give it. It is ok to respectfully disagree and have a calm debate/discussion about the topic, but to jump to attacking the commenter is just childish. Thank you for being a great community, overall. The banter, information and jokes I receive from this site is fantastic and has really helped me grow as a soccer fan. Keep being great!

2kfprs	-21128	1414384472	DestinyTheGame	If you're not playing all three classes you're missing out on most of this game.	There is a reason that there are three character slots. After playing a Warlock from launch I've been playing a Titan since last Friday and it's reminding me why I enjoy this game so much. Little things like different grenade mechanics, getting to enjoy leveling up and unlocking new abilities again, even the difference in the way that jumping feels are breathing new life into the game for me. Also punching. The raw mechanics of the game are what make it fun, both in PvP and PvE. I would be the first to admit that I am terrifically disappointed in the overall execution of the game's larger elements (story, loot, level design, content variety, etc), but you've got to hand it to Bungie that they produced a game that has solid moment to moment mechanics and that all three classes are different enough to keep things interesting, but also feel consistent. TL;DR Sunbros, Punch Brothers, and Frabjous Cape-Wearers are all equally awesome, don't miss out!

From a macroscopic perspective it makes more intuitive sense, but I think I'm missing something on the molecular level. When water collides with a hard surface, some kind of rock, do the individual water molecules really impart enough energy to separate the molecules forming the rock from one another? How does the water impart energy over time to break those bonds?

2vheu7	-21128	1423616895	leagueoflegends	How the hell do people play this game competitively?	I've been playing the game for just over three years now, but for the last year or so I have had near constant issues with getting the game to function correctly. I took a significant amount of time off from the game at one point because it lagged horribly and had that awful stuttering audio glitch. I tried for a few weeks to fix it, uninstall, reinstall, repair, rollback video card drivers, install new drivers, nothing seemed to work. After a while I came back and the issues were fixed, but now I'm running into constant game lag. I watch my J4 stand in the jungle with his health ticking down, not swinging his lance, then he hits three times in quick succession, then he does nothing. I watch abilities go off around me, or sometimes champs just walking back and forth, then a big fight happens in the space of a second and I get to watch the respawn timer. I'm really getting frustrated with the godawful performance of this game, and I'm not sure what to do about it. I love playing league, I'm just getting back into it after a bit of a hiatus, but I can't wrap my brain around how anyone plays this game competitively when I can't even get it to function without significant, gamebreaking glitches and lag. Does this stuff not constantly plague everyone else?
2w2981	-21128	1424079306	leagueoflegends	Let's talk about Ryze.	Ryze is one of my favorite champs. I like his theme, classic spellslinger, and his overall design as a low CD tanky mage. Mechanically, he's broken as hell. Trying to cast spells with Ryze is stutterific, as you half-heartedly walk a couple of steps, try to cast a spell and stop walking, then watch as your enemy continues to run away and your spell never casts. This seems to be due in part to a delay on cast that doesn't feel intentional. There's no cast time, no wind up, if the target is completely in range then the spells fly (almost) immediately on cast with no displayed cast time (albeit slowly, side note: is it really reasonable for fizz to have time to go into his pole before your Q reaches him?. But if they are on the edge of your range then it is a stutter-stepping nightmare just trying to finish some one off. This handicap seems not only like a broken function, but unnecessary given Ryze's inherent downsides. He's got no mobility aside from a bit of a speed up on R, and only one form of CC. His spells take long enough to cast that you can't even get Rylai's procs as you run away because most champs, if they're close enough to take a Q to the face, are about to hit you with a low CD gap closer. So I'd like to hear some suggestions about how to fix Ryze and make him playable again, anyone have thoughts they'd like to share?
2xcdn5	-21128	1425037737	atheism	C.S. Lewis is considered by many Christians to be the last word in apologetics, and this is what he has to say about science and faith. Honestly it's embarrassing.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJu0oYvi-cYAnd this is what I had to say in the thread that it was posted in.WRONG. Ugh. SO wrong. Apologists are CONSTANTLY giving interesting sounding false analogies for things, and physicists with a stomach for rhetoric have been pointing out their fallacies for ages.Given a man with a pool cue and a billiard ball, a scientist could tell you precisely the way that the ball will move if provided with all of the relevant variables. A scientist may not assume interference, a second man with a second pool cue, but he does not dismiss the very possibility of a second man out of hand, and if provided with variables describing the action of the second cue upon the ball he would still be able to describe the motion of the ball. This is a patently false analogy. To give a true analogy, it would be to say that a scientist could tell you the motion of a ball, but that he would be unable to explain the sudden transformation of the ball into a lemon. If balls spontaneously turned into lemons as a matter of course in the universe and science was left dumbfounded as to the explanation for these events then it would be entirely reasonable to accept other equally irrational events like the virgin birth. But a ball has never spontaneously turned into a lemon, and in fact in the history of scientific expedition there has never been an event witnessed that was sufficiently analogous to the miraculous event of a ball turning into a lemon to merit the consideration of the possibility of this type of event.

330hsv	-21128	1429345996	atheism	A Letter From My Grandparents	http://i.imgur.com/0LZfRvz.jpgAnd my response."This may be one of the most viciously unkind and ignorant things I've ever read. Going through a traumatic event would not change my concept of evil, it would not cause me to question my beliefs, and I have no problem identifying right and wrong, no thanks to the miserable excuse for a god you think controls everything. My understanding of the nature of evil is a large part of how I have defined the non-existence of a benevolent deity. I am better than your god because if I had infinite power and love I would never allow the existence of evil, I would never allow people to hurt and be violated needlessly, by nature or by other beings. I have enough of a moral sense to realize that suffering is never good, and that the potential for positive effects or outcomes in no way justifies any evil. I am fortunate enough that I have not had terrible events occur in my life, but I am under no illusions as to the possibility of such events. Neither am I naïve enough to believe that there's an all-powerful being who could save me from such an event, and I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that were such an event to occur he would not reach down and prevent it. I know this because terrible events happen every moment of every day and your god does nothing. The thought of it is sickening.A man who enters my home uninvited is a criminal, he has broken the law of the land. A man who violates the sanctity of my being as a conscious creature has committed a moral evil, he has inflicted suffering which objectively causes a reduction in my quality of life. A god who has the power to effortlessly prevent suffering and does nothing is himself evil, a monster. I have no need for absolute morality or absolute right and wrong, talking about morals in absolutes is completely meaningless. Morality is by definition the discussion of events in the context of their effect on conscious beings. Making it into a massive chart whereby we measure events against an ill-defined yet hard-and-fast line is ridiculous. Yes, life is amazing. The world is a vast, inscrutable place filled with mysteries and incredible reality, but it takes precisely zero faith to understand that life evolved or that there is no cause to the universe. I can't even begin to explain how we know these things, and you clearly have no desire to truly understand them. I do not want to live forever, in fact I can think of few things that sound more horrifying than eternal life. Any version of me that would enjoy living forever would not be me. I would far rather die and cease experiencing anything than live forever, in fact I'm rather looking forward to it. If eternal life is all that god has to offer then he can keep it, and if he would allow me to suffer forever for making that choice then he really is evil.  If praying makes you feel good then by all means do so, I certainly don't begrudge you the right. I can't help but wonder about the efficacy of the practice considering how little effect it appears to be having, but if you think it's a good idea then have at it. I am me, and I know precisely what I think and why I think it. But I am not so arrogant as to think that I have the answers to the greatest mysteries of existence, I am not so morally corrupt that I can pick and choose moral principles while insisting that I'm following an absolute standard, and I am not so foolish as to believe that an ancient death cult's holy book has any bearing on my life. I took some time to think about Adam's words in his comment, about why I should care, and I've decided that even though I do care it is probably a waste of my time to continue arguing with brainwashed people who can't even see the insanity of what they espouse.

3bmjsy	-21128	1435668533	atheism	More gay marriage nonsense	My religious cousin posted an article called "It's Time To Legalize Polygamy" that was intended to highlight the apparent inconsistency of people who were in favor of the Obergefell decision but against legalizing polygamy. Of course a long discussion ensued, but I wanted to share what I contributed to the discussion."I just want to point out how ridiculous it is that for the last couple of decades the conversation has been about gay marriage, when prior to that it was about homosexual behavior period. Conservatives would have us believe that all they want is to maintain "traditional marriage" but that's just patently untrue. What they actually want is for people to behave in the way that they prescribe, and they want to legislate that behavior if at all possible. Thus the necessity of Lawrence v. Texas. They are behaving precisely the same way they did prior to Loving v. Virginia. "They're free to marry people of their own race." and "They're free to marry anyone of the opposite gender." sound equally bigoted to me. Not to mention that a binary understanding of gender and sexual identity is just laughably oversimplified in modern times. "Traditional marriage" is not a standard that can be upheld, both in the light of the infographic Matt Powers posted above, and because of our understanding of what gender and sexual identity mean today. When you say a "man" and a "woman" can get married but no one else, does that mean people born with XY/XX genes and with only the associated parts? What about chromosomal abnormality? Will you allow XXY people to marry XX'ers or XY'ers? How about hermaphrodites, or voluntary or involuntary gender reassignment? How about asexuals? How about every time someone wants a marriage license we require proof of their genetic makeup and a signed medical description of their sex organs. I know that this is a reductio ad absurdum but I don't think it's invalid at all, this is what would be necessary if conservatives were as committed to "man/woman" marriages as they claim to be. The problem is that it's not about marriage, it's about ignorance, it's about bigotry and fear, it's about repressing those who are different from yourself and I simply cannot stomach the denial of that fact any longer. As to what I presume was the point of posting this article, you are precisely correct that it is not logically consistent to agree with the Obergefell ruling and to still be against polygamy or incestual relationships, and personally I am not against those things. You can be upset at the potential legal or moral quagmire they may present, but you can't legislate against them nor should you. Legislating the behavior of consenting adults has proven time and again to be not only ineffective but morally objectionable (see: the drug war, back alley abortions, homosexual behavior prior to Lawrence, etc.) The essence of the Obergefell decision was to increase freedom, to eliminate a true injustice, to provide equal representation under the law for citizens of the United States, to marry and have a legally recognized relationship with another adult regardless of your gender or sexual orientation. Most religions do not "preach hate", but they do breed ignorance, they do stifle diversity, they have and continue to homogenize behavior and normalize stigma. Religion demands obedience, rigidity, dogma. There is no room for mixed definitions, gray space, or tolerance when your standards are absolute and your consequences are eternal."
3fb5nj	-21128	1438361708	DestinyTheGame	Help catching up after hiatus	Alright guardians, I think it's time I came back to the game. I stopped playing a couple of weeks after the release of TDB. I'm level 30 on my hunter, warlock, and titan. After playing religiously I just got a bit burnt out. However, with TTK on the horizon and all the content from HOW looking pretty cool, I think I'm ready to get back into the game and finish out my Year 1 achievements. My question for you guys is basically, what have I missed? What are the new must-have items, how has the game changed since the release of HOW, what's the best way to go about leveling up to tackle the new content? Any help is appreciated, it feels like a lot is different since that first TDB patch.

I walked a dangerous path in high school, acting as a curl bro with no respect to the mighty lower limbs.     Just over a year ago, a friend (who I now see was simply an agent of Broki in disguise), suggested we pledge membership to the evil Planet Fitness. I agreed. The whispers of Broki assured me that smith machine squats and presses were the same. That the mighty deadlift was too hard on joints.      Despite these poor choices, I have found the true path of Brodin in such undesirable places. I am now without contract to Planet Fitness, and I will be seeking worship elsewhere. So I ask of you, Swolesiblings, shall I seek membership at the local YMCA or worship at home? I only have a barbell and plates for home. But I could worship alongside my 2 year old boy, as he play in the yard until he too is of worship age. Thank you all. Wheymen.

I found a wonderful lenovo laptop that with employee pricing I was able to bring down to $1100 from its initial $2000+ price tag. He asked one of his friends for a second opinion who promptly linked him to a MBP refurb. Despite me advising him that as an engineer there are no real benefits and that some of the programs he uses may not be supported on the Mac, he bought it anyway...A week later he tells me that he can't get .exe's to work. sigh. I come over to install bootcamp, at this point he asks me to wipe and just leave windows on it. At this point I convince him to return the MBP.A week later all money is returned to his card and we are back to buying laptops. He sees an ultra book on the Lenovo website and is dead set on getting it despite it being a horrible deal with a crap processor (1.9 ghz dual core gahhhh).Last time I help him try to buy anything lol

27ghhk	-21156	1402046950	Awesomenauts	A Guide to not Feeding	Having played one too many games with one too many feeders, I decided that rather than complain about it endlessly, I'd try to get the word out. A lot of this is fairly obvious, but it apparently needs to be said to some people.**The Basics of Not Feeding**1) Early game especially: respect your opponents. Don't initiate without decisive advantage. If you're not sure whether or not you have decisive advantage, don't take the risk.2) A big part of not initiating involves not letting your opponents initiate either. If your opponent could potentially initiate from their current position, then you need to be prepared for that possibility. Have your abilities off cooldown, and know your escape route for if things turn to shit.3) Speaking of escape routes: if an opponent can drop in on your escape route, then it isn't actually an escape route; it's an ambush waiting to happen. You need to know where an enemy could drop in on you from along your route. If there are enemy team members whose locations are unknown, and you don't have line of sight on the ambush points, then you need to fall back to a safer position. Don't be afraid to hug your turret for a few seconds just because enemies are MIA and allies aren't nearby, especially at &lt;70% health.4) This isn't strictly related to your not feeding, but: if you see an ally escaping on pixel health, escort him. Don't charge in and get yourself killed on his behalf, but do run a little behind him, throw out some slows/snares/etc. for him. Assisting your allies in not feeding is cool.5) Cloaks. If the enemy could be cloaked, assume that they are, and therefore assume that you could be in tongue distance of Leon (or, on Augillion, about to eat a stealth-nuke). This could mean going back to base if you're on low health; Leon can stealth-gank you from within turret range and get out safely if you're &lt;50HP.6) Not only are you not necessarily safe under a turret, you're not immune to damage from behind one, either. Coco's force ball is the most well-known example of this, but a few AoE abilities can hit through turrets too (most notably Vinnie's spike dash). Sentry can BHS you out from behind a turret; the message here is that if the enemy can hit you through your turret, you need to take precautions. Watch for the BHS animation, watch for force balls, don't stand too close to the turret if your health is low and enemy AoE is off cooldown.**What To Do If You're Feeding Anyway**Sometimes, you'll follow these instructions, or feel like you're following them, and die anyway. Those games where &lt;1 minute in an epilepsy-inducing teamfight breaks out and you're not totally sure how you died, then you die again while the first death is still on your mind or whatever. You're going 3/0 four minutes in, and yeah, it sucks.1) Don't do whatever you did to die the first three times. Sounds obvious, but seriously, if Skoldir got all three kills on you, stay out of his way for a bit.2) Fuck your build order and buy your escape abilities. Anything affects your opponents' movement or speeds you up can be an asset in your quest to stop feeding. Buy health/regen too, but they're honestly not as useful as good escape abilities a lot of the time. Keep doing this until you stop feeding.3) If you can clear creep waves effectively (generally via burst), it is totally acceptable to just sit by your turret and farm for a bit. This isn't a recommended long-term game strategy most of the time, but it does mean that your turret probably won't be pushed, it'll help you overcome the level gap without putting yourself at risk, and most importantly: some players get overconfident on a killing spree, and start to do stupid things. Even fed Ayla will probably die if she tries to come after full-health you under turret fire. Beware displacement/cloaks as per usual, though.**TL;DR**Don't be reckless. Know your safe zones. Be in those safe zones when you're on low health. Be within range of these safe zones should the enemy attempt to gank you. Remember that displacement and cloak change these safe zones.**Finally**I've oversimplified a little. Some Nauts, like Froggy and Coco, have an enormous amount of freedom in where they can roam lategame, because they're simply so fast with such good escape tools that you won't die in anything short of 3 vs. 1. Having said that, for a beginner, until you get a better feel for safety, this is a good set of rules of thumb until you better know the capabilities of your chosen character, and until you get better at the game.

2auuug	-21156	1405517898	yugioh	[R/F] Reckless Frogs, for DN but may build IRL	For those of you not familiar with Frogs, the basic aim of the deck is to stall the game out with you recurring 2000 walls until you win; the deck also has some form of grind game in that some of its major plays are repeatable; triple Des Croaking and two copies of Sea Lancer are augmented with Creature Swap and potential C101 recursion.Winning happens for a variety of reasons. One, you opponent can't answer Sea Lancer. Two, your opponent can't answer C101. Three, you score an OTK. The deck has multiple feasible OTKs, including double Phoenix+Gachi Gachi, triple Des Frog+Phoenix, and Phoenix + Volcasaurus into Gaia vs. 1300 beater.I feel there may be a significant flaw in my build which I'm just not seeing; I don't have quite the winrate I'd like/expect (I don't expect to be beating any top tier decks, but I would like to see this wrecking T3 reliably). Given the non-linearity of the deck, this could just be my piloting, but I suspect not.Monsters (17)* 3× Des Frog* 3× Dupe Frog* 3× Mother Grizzly* 3× Ronintoadin* 3× Swap Frog* 2× Sea LancerSpells (14)* 3× Des Croaking* 3× Inferno Reckless Summon: This is a significant portion of a wincon. IRS off a Ronintoadin allows me to go for triple Des Frog, opening up OTKs at best and C101 at worst. IRS off Swap Frog with an established grave opens up the Rank 2 OTK.* 3× Shard of Greed* 2× Creature Swap* 2× Pot of Duality: SSing is too important for three. A significant portion of this deck's wincon is battle damage OTK, so Upstart doesn't seem a good idea.* 1× Foolish BurialTraps (9)* 3× Breakthrough Skill: Only added these today, actually, so they're untested. I still prefer Fiendish (stops attacks, continuous negation), but given Sea Lancer, I prefer non-continuous traps.* 2× Trap Stun: Deck doesn't OTK fast enough to justify three.* 1× Bottomless Trap Hole* 1× Compulsory Evacuation Device* 1× Solemn Warning* 1× Torrential TributeExtra Deck (15)* 2× Daigusto Phoenix: Too good* 2× Gachi Gachi Gentetsu: Stalls* 1× Adreus, Keeper of Armageddon* 1× Artifact Durendal* 1× Gaia Dragon, the Thunder Charger* 1× Number 101: Silent Honor ARK (I very rarely make it via Creature Swap, but it's not Extra Deck space I was using anyway, and C101 recursion is that good)* 1× Number 61: Volcasaurus* 1× Number 73: Abyss Splash* 1× Number 96: Dark Mist* 1× Number C101: Silenr Honor DARK* 1× Shark Fortress* 1× Tiras, Keeper of Genesis* 1× Wind-Up Arsenal ZenmaiohSide Deck (13)* 3× Mystical Space Typhoon* 3× Gozen Match* 2× Effect Veiler* 2× Maxx "C"* 2× Nobleman of Crossout* 2× Prohibition* 1× Thunder King Rai-Oh

2ckzho	-21156	1407155208	yugioh	Custom Banlist under the philosophy of minimum bans. Test/discuss/rate/whathaveyou	For a while now, I've been casually working on a custom banlist designed to curb the game's power creep, but very recently, I decided to swing the other way.Finally inspired to action by a recent thread, but also inspired by a few other comments elsewhere (notably a post about M:tG's Modern banlist), I cut the banlist to what I felt to be a bare minimum, down to fourteen cards. All newly unbanned cards go to one:* Baby Drulers* Butterfly Dagger -- Elma* Dragon Ravine* Elemental Hero Stratos* Exchange of the Spirit* Fishborg Blaster* Makyura the Destructor* Mind Master* Mass Driver* Spellbook of Judgement* Substitoad* Super Rejuvination* Temple of the KingsDrulers, Ravine, Rejuvination, Stratos, and Spellbook of Judgement all stayed at zero because of participation in still-threatening T0 decks (Yes, Druler/Spellbook were contemporary with each other, doesn't change the core idea being expressed). Makyura, Temple of the Kings, and Exchange of the Spirit all stayed on the list for being trad FTK staples. Substitoad, Fishborg Blaster, and Mass Driver all stayed banned for being key to T1 FTKs (which are unreasonably strengthened with Pot of Greed, Graceful, etc.).This list can easily be cut to twelve by banning adult Drulers and brining back babies, Ravine, and Rejuvination, but I feel that the Drulers have "legitimate" use in-game, while Rejuvination is just a dumb draw card and Ravine wouldn't see use in this hypothetical format outside of a pure Drulers deck.One way to look at this is "trad light"; Traditional format minus rampart FTKing. I fully expect Chaos decks to do exceptionally well under this list, but also expect them to have to compete with combo decks assisted by the new draw power, and burn decks seeking to take advantage of the high cost of Solemn Judgement and recurring costs of Royal Oppression/Imperial Order.So, now what? Well, if enough people are interested, I wouldn't mind testing this list, seeing if anything was missed, seeing if anything can still come off. Discussion is also welcome along this line.I wouldn't mind working on the current Limited and Semi-Limited lists to see if they can do with a similar treatment. A cursory glance of the Limited list makes me think that the only things that need to stay are Allure, BLS, DAD, and the Drulers, but I may have missed something (triple Monster Gate could possibly be used to set up unfair fields); several currently banned cards could also move up to three with them. The Semi list has always been a joke and could all go to three under this paradigm.EDIT: This went down in flames and is now buried. The hate for this list was largely knee-jerk reactions to the unbanning for cards which would wreck the official Advanced format; anyone stumbling across it, please actually consider the following:1) There are no reliable FTKs here. Cat and Future Fusion are joke FTKs that rely on *not* drawing combo pieces. Future Fusion actually saw limited competitive play, and was a bad deck. I have edited in Mind Master and Butterfly Dagger -- Elma, and acknowledge the possibility that Tempest FTK could be a problem. Actually play some Traditional before making comments along this line; FTKs define Traditional's limited metagame, and actually playing Traditional is vital to understanding FTK formats.2) This "format" has decks in it which are bullshit degeneracy by the standards of the Advanced metagame. This is known, and this is not considered to be a problem; the aim is to have enough bullshit degenerate decks that they can compete against each other in a relatively diverse metagame.3) I do not believe this list to be the basis of a dice-roll format. Tele-DAD players have long known that making an explosive play without winning the game on that turn can be dangerous in formats full of power cards; the same thing should happen here. Spending all your resources on setting up an "unfair" field turn one is asking to lose it to Raigeki/Dark Hole, or having a key piece fall victim to Snatch Steal.4) This is a draft list. I may have missed something. Chaos may be warping under this list. Super Rejuvination and Stratos are not necessarily deserving of bans with such a high power ceiling. I can't improve it without testers.

38wk4h	-21156	1433682170	Newgioh	Tour Guide of the Underworld ratios	TGU is the format's shiniest "new" toy and gives all non-Chaos decks access to a 3000 beater, and I think a lot of people have assumed that the card therefore needs to be run at three (yes, it also searches Sangan and I will mention that).I'm not so sure about this, and there are a few things I don't really like about the card:1) Spamming Acid Golem of Destruction seems *really* dangerous. Prematurely dropping BLS in Goats is subject to all kinds of game-winning counterplay, and a lot of it should be almost as effective against Acid Golem. Acid Golem can also be stalled out for burn, or worse, stolen then returned for burn. I have to suspect that Acid Golem hitting the field will often spell GG for one player. Any time you cannot either safely make Acid Golem or search Sangan, TGU is a dead card.  2) Related to the previous point, TGU doesn't really do very many things, just one thing very well (one-and-a-half things). In a slow format where you are guaranteed to see most of your cards, running narrow cards probably isn't optimal. You can increase its utility by splashing janky stuff like the Night Assailant discard engine, but I think this raises more problems than it solves.  3) TGU at two also has inherent problems; if you play one TGU to search Sangan, your other TGU is completely dead, and drawing into both TGUs is awful.Based on this, I think TGU is actually best run at one in most decks.

I know its been brought up before, but I can't stand how almost every server has the standard map rotation and standard ticket count. Like if you're gonna buy a server, at least make it different from the rest (like 400% TDM/Dom Favorite maps)! Literally 90% of the rented servers are basically DICE servers with a custom name.If you have a server on console (I play PS4, so please admins) please list it down below so other players can see it. Many thanks!
26z79p	-21160	1401565248	Solving_A858	New dude here, whats the big deal?	After going through some of these posts, I'm kinda boggled as to why so many people are showing attention to A858. I mean couldn't I just slam my keyboard and get up with something like dfaf54c5a84h45m46a46t4a211nn? I don't mean to hate, but could it just be a troll just messing with all of us? It could be an experiment (ya'll the lab rats) or an advertising campaign (Think about all the hype around the number "5210" for a few months as a campaign against child obesity). Again, I don't mean hostility, I'm genuinely curious as to why this "A858" guy is so popular. **EDIT: I DIDN'T mean to be offensive! I don't get why so many people are downvoting this. I was simply asking what made this user so intresting, and (indirectly) what progress what ya'll have made about him**

I don't have CTE, so that's why I'm posting this here. I'm trying to get as much attention as possible. If you have any suggestions, please put them down below, I'll edit this to fit your suggestion. Here it is:      SOMEONE PLEASE READ! Since I can't get CTE, can someone please pass this info to DICE via the forms:  1. DICE should seriously consider a BC2 DLC. If they can translate the maps over cleanly, limit the amount of player count, and NOT add any gimmicks or leveloution (just some good 'ol vanilla BC2, no bloat), I would pay a lot of money (maybe even 30 bucks) if its as good as BC2. **Maybe that'll get EA's attention.**  2. Commander mode: GONE! I think I don't need to explain this.3. On consoles, **the quick match feature is broken!** Its so hard to find 64 man rush servers that don't run on a 100 tickets on a stock map rotation. The games are so short and stale. The fix is easy: promote custom rules by adding them to quick match. PC's get it off so much better because they can find the server of their choice. Not on consoles. 4. Dragons Teeth should remind me a lot of BC2 and Aftermath DLC maps. Those were the best. Since DICE LA made the Aftermath DLC (99% sure), I think they should know how to make a good, rush-centric DLC.  5. Just like #4, EA and DICE should make Rush the **priority** for the last two DLC's. I know map design for these DLC's are almost done, but they should try to at least try.  And finally the most important one...    **DICE must open up CTE forums to the public. I understand that they don't wanna talk about something that ends of failing in CTE in the public eye, but I shouldn't have to ask you to speak on my behalf. Transparency is exactly what DICE and EA need right now, not covering things up.**    Anyways, if you do decide to help me out, you can use my username ThatAngryGnome. I would really appreciate it if you could do me that favor. Many thanks!﻿     End of post.      Can someone please do me a HUGE favor and put this on CTE? One small copy and paste means a lot to me!  **Suggestion #1** (from me, another comment reply):  In respect to the BC2 DLC, I wouldn't mind an easy copy and paste graphical wise. In fact, I'd rather have DICE go down that route. It would, however, require a revamped weapon balance system because BF4 has so many more weapons when compared to BC2, so gunplay would be different (potentially game breaking). Again, I wouldn't mind if it was a paid DLC, even for premium users like me. Thats how important I think this idea is. ﻿

Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using. * School work, web browsing, no games and no notable programs. **NO GAMING GPU PLEASE** * What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes? * Try to keep it under 500 * When do you plan on building/buying the PC? * Within next month or so * What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc) * Just the laptop itself. I would like to upgrade the HDD to an SSD, so if you can get that within the cost (either a manufacturer upgrade or manual). A 120 gb is fine, but if you could go over, I would be amazed.* Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location? * Oklahoma (Boomer Sooner!), no microcenter* If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated. * Nope* Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU? * Nope* Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc) * Would love to have an SSD because of how blazing fast they go. * Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components? * Since its for school, a thin and well built laptop would help.* Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?  * Since its a laptop, I really have no other choice but just the get the OS that the manufacturer gives me. Between Win 7 or 8, I really don't care. If it is Win 7, I can always get a cheap 25 buck upgrade to Win 8.1 from my university so don't let that deter you.* Extra info if required:I don't need a freaking 880m. I don't need a 4700m. I don't need 12 gigs of RAM. If I can get these for under 500 then sure, sign me up! But what I'm looking for is a laptop that **will not degrade over time, like my old laptop.** That's why I want an SSD, something that won't fail me, something that won't slow down over time. A super fast processor isn't needed, but I do prefer an i3 (or better), not a Celeron or Pentium. I haven't had that much experince for AMD, so if it is an AMD, please make it good. 4 gigs of RAM is good, but 6 or even 8 would be better. **One thing to note is that this laptop should be at least decent in battery life. Its for school.**     Many thanks.

All what I need is a laptop that runs my few select programs (Chrome, Word, ect...) fast. I just need something that will last a long time in college.    Many thanks.

2b0ud7	-21160	1405660510	battlefield_4	Thank you DICE for answering one of my prayers (Propaganda).	Okay let me get this out of the way: When I saw the DT leaks, trailers, and what not, there was only one thing on my mind: I'm gonna hate Propaganda. I felt it was gonna be a Shanghai (a map that I don't hate but don't love either), but bigger and more vehicle centric. To be honest, I though Sunken Dragon was gonna be my favorite map.    Oh how the tables have changed.    You see, I come from a BC2 background ("ah its yet another one of those BC2 "veteran" noobs right?"). And if you were to dumb down the graphics and change a few things, I would bet my money that this was  a BC2 map.    It has that BC2 feel. Everything from the destructible houses to the infantry combat (medium range was BC2's specialty if you don't remember) to the snow. When playing it I sometimes feel the BC2 nostalgia. The map *plays out* like any map from BC2. To anyone who hasn't played BC2. Here are some screen shots of some of the snowy maps:. [White Pass](http://www.wesleytack.com/wp-content/uploads/games/BadCompany2_WhitePass_01.jpg) and [Port Valdez](http://www.gamer.ru/system/attached_images/images/000/011/811/original/957916_05212009_embed002.jpg). And although they don't play out exactly like these snow maps, they do share some common themes together.      And that's what I've been begging DICE for since BF3. I don't know if DICE took cues from BC2 (I'm willing to bet they did), but it seems like whoever made this map has connections with BC2.    I can't put my finger on it, but there's something in this map that screams "BC2!"    As for Sunken Dragon (the map I thought would be my favorite), I think its DICE's crack at trying to make yet another asymmetrical map like Lancang Dam. And they failed again (albeit Operation Mortar is pretty good).    So tell me guys, is it just me who thinks Propaganda is BC2-like map?    Oh yea and remember my judgments come from Conquest, not Rush. I refuse to play on Rush [as it is completely broken on consoles](http://us.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/26j8je/psa_to_all_console_admins/). Its a shame, I know, and the fix is really easy if DICE decides to implement it.

I'm looking at [this](http://www.amazon.com/Acer-V7-482PG-5842-14-Inch-Touchscreen-Ultrabook/dp/B00K2O4UMS/ref=sr_1_4?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1406610429&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=acer+aspire+v7), mainly cause its sleek, sexy, and yet packs a decent GPU for light gaming (stuff like CS:GO, TF2, Gary's Mod ect...) but I was wondering how well it would perform in BF4 and BF3? I'm hoping to hit 60fps on 1080p on medium with stuff like anti-aliasing turned down. If not, I plan on getting something a bit better.    **EDIT:** Although that model isn't out yet, there are similar models like it on Amazon.

Okay so I've been confused for sometime about who is in the friendzone in specific situations so here's one: Someone likes you (like kinda obvious) but you want to keep you relationship strictly "friends". Thus you act like besties and what not. So who's stuck in the friendzone?    EDIT: Okay just to clear things up, I couldn't care less about who's in it. I was just genuinely curious as it was kinda confusing me. Now that the question is answered, I'm all good and couldn't care less about the situation.

2cy0oy	-21160	1407465507	battlefield_4	We need a way to thank developers like t1gge for everything they've done.	When BF4's development moved to DICE LA, the devs basically looked at DICE Stockholm and EA and said [this](http://imgur.com/WzKQNoi).    Point being, they've taken the worse Battlefield launch in history and are turning it upside down.    And this isn't only about the technical bugs and problems we've been having. This is about revamping the game to what a true Battlefield should be like. Examples include the Rush Initiative and the brand-new Teamwork Initiative. They're adding things that we lost as the Battlefield franchise grew.    Now **by no means do I say Battlefield 4 is fixed and the game is glorious or this is the best Battlefield ever.** There's a long way before that happens. But I do wish I, along with the rest of the Battlefield community who appreciates their hard work, could have a way to express our gratitude for working so hard on what seemed like a lost cause a few months ago.     So unless anyone has any suggestions on how to thank them (I'm out of ideas), then to all of DICE LA: Thank you from my bottom of my heart.     EDIT: EA and DICE to t1gge, [please](http://imgur.com/tHjdISU)    EDIT #2: A lot of people have mentioned that t1gge was originally from DICE Stockholm. To that, I answer with this [comment](http://us.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/299xgi/the_new_dice/ciiumhc) that I posted on another "thank you" note posted some time ago. Basically, I explain why I think most of the devs at DICE (whether that be Stockholm or LA) deserve praise even if their work didn't actually make it to the final release.

Fast forward a few years and I have a tampered glass protector yet don't like how it feels (although that's why I bought it in the first place).

So here's the problem:  A roller coaster of mass *m* starts from rest at an elevation of _h_`1` and rolls down and then up to another incline of a lower height _h_`2`.      a.) What is the kinetic energy of the coaster when it reaches  the top of the second incline?   Basically they want the equation you'd use.    b.) Calculate the kinetic energy of a 2500-kg coaster atop the second incline of height 20.0m if it starts from rest at the top of the first incline, 30.0m high.     Now I'm enticed to simply use the equation *K=mgh*, where *h* is _h_`1` - _h_`2`. Since we haven't touched on this kind of problem, I'm stuck thinking if I am actually calculating the kinetic energy. Someone help please.    EDIT: For reference, the chapter we are on hasn't mentioned potential energy. The few equations we have been given here are:  1.)_F_`net` x ∆X = (1/2)mv^2 - (1/2)m_v_`0`^2   2.)K = (1/2)mv^2  3.)_W_`net`= _F_`net`* ∆X   ]  4.)W = mgh      So when someone brings up potential energy (which I understand why they are), it gets a bit confusing. After reading the two answers below, I *think* I understand whats going on and will *try* to work it out. Otherwise, an actual professor could help me out.

2jn98u	-21160	1413672822	battlefield_4	Fellow Battlefield players, I need your help! My laptop won't run BF4 (mainly) with dedicated graphics.	Now, although I do play BF3 on PC, I play mainly BF4 on PS4. A lot of my friends (and my clan) plays on PS4 so I decided against playing PC. Fast forward a few months and I have about a grand to spend on a laptop (not a desktop due to my specific situation), so I bought the Lenovo Y50. I really don't want those typical "laptops aren't for gaming" crap; there is a reason why I could only buy a laptop.    Now, my problem is this: I can't run BF4 using dedicated graphics (its an 860m which is more than capable for medium-high settings on). I can play BF3 just fine, along with other games like Mirror's Edge, TF2, Crysis, Portal, you name it. BF4 chooses to run on integrated no matter what. Now here is what I have done to remedy this solution with failure:   * I run on High-Performance mode on my laptop* I have right clicked and gone in Nvidia Control Panel and chose dedicated graphics as my main driver. I have also assigned it as my driver specifically for BF4.exe and BF4x86.exe. Everything reverts back to integrated after closing.  * I have right clicked BF4 and ran it with High Performance NVidia drivers. No go  * I have upgraded my drivers from the stock 332.50 to the 344.11 drivers released by Nvidia. Nothing. However, these aren't certified by Lenovo, so I downgraded them back to 332.50 and tried it again. Nothing again.  * I have hooked up an external display to the laptop *which runs on dedicated graphics* and tried to run BF4. Nope.  * And many more things I can't even remember. Nothing helped.    With all of this in mind, note that this is the 1 week trial version of BF4. From experince, it seems like there is no difference between this and the normal version; you can simply buy BF4 on Origin and take that timer off your back. To prove this point, I have the latest CTE-to-vanilla patch running.    I have a feeling that this has to do with Battlelog opening up before BF4.exe to select your game, so when you specifically tell the laptop to run the application using Nvidia drivers, it *runs battlelog* and not the application. That runs off battlelog and thus runs on integrated graphics. BF3 works flawlessly, however, even though that too launches from battlelog.     I'm stuck and need help. I've posted this question in many other tech-based communities and thought it would be nice to get the Battlefield's community's response to this too. Hope you guys can help.    **EDIT:** So I uninstalled the Intel 4600 drivers hoping that'd force the 860m, and now no games run because of a DirectX error. Trying to reinstall the the drivers (both the .zip and the .exe) files won't help; the installer says my computer doesn't meet the requirements. Again this is a known bug from Intel with no solution found online working. I'm going to do a fresh install of Windows and see how that works out.  __________________________________________________________________________________________________  **EDIT 2:** So its been a week since I asked this, and I got a lot of responses. Thank you everyone.    I contact Lenovo about the problem, and they insisted that I *pay* for a CD recovery of Window 8.1 (^^like wtf?!), so I decided to first try reinstalling Windows from a different source than my original. After the reinstall, I found that Nvidia Control panel now *does* save my changes if I ask it to, oh lets say, force the 860m to turn on while playing games regardless of its power state. What I think I did wrong was originally, I installed Nvidia drivers from the website and then the Intel 4600 drivers. What I should have done was to install the Intel drivers first, then the stock Nvidia drivers *from Lenovo's website*, then upgrade the drivers through GForce Experience.    After doing all this, I bought a retail copy of BF4 (yay!) and downloaded it. Every other game worked flawlessly after the reinstall, and so did BF4. I then proceeded to use MSI Afterburner to check FPS and GPU temps and my game kept crashing. After reopening BF4 with Afterburner running, I got the same low FPS treatment. Moral of the story: **MSI AFTERBURNER DOES NOT WORK WITH BF4 (well at least not for me)**    I think this was actually *two* separate problems, but now I have everything worked out. **Thank you everyone who helped me out!**

The three papers I am looking at are [Leather papers](http://www.origami-shop.com/en/pack-leather-origami-papers-xml-207_215_458_626-3212.html), [Unryu papers](http://www.origami-shop.com/en/packunryu10sheets60x60scrapbookingblackchocolatecamelsmokewhiteivoryyellowredbrownorangeorigamishopcom-xml-207_215_624_253_376-1414.html), or [Tissue-Foil papers](http://www.origami-shop.com/en/tissuefoil-papers-origami-xsl-207_215_624_354_356.html)    People have told me that Tissue Foil is hard to work with, and I have *no* experience with anything but normal printer paper or thin butcher/cheap origami paper. I plan on buying a pack of either 10 or 20 sheets (they are a bit costly, but I don't expect to succeed the first time), so I want to make the correct decision.    Here's what I need: thin (complex models), big (like 60+ cm, square please), and available via shipping. Although good looking papers would be nice, I'd rather work on "scarp" paper before seriously working on a perfect model.    So for anyone who has worked with different types of papers, which one would you recommend for someone who has almost no experience in special papers? I'm leaning towards Unryu or Leather, because if Tissue-Foil is like folding household foil (as someone described it to me as), I think I'd loose my sanity before I finished folding. Thanks for the input.

I'm designing a PC for someone who will be using it primarily for AutoCad alongside other similar programs. He is on a budget, so I have the Intel Core i3 ~~4460~~ 4360 in the build right now. It is a dual core processor with 4 threads. His current build has a quad core (a crappy one BTW), so I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing by slapping on a dual core. Alongside that, I have 16 gigs of RAM and a 750 TI for a three way monitor setup. If anyone who knows what they're talking about can help me out here, is quad core performance? Would it be worth it convincing him (its not that easy BTW) spend an extra 100$ on a quadcore like a 4690k or 4460? Or should I consider AMD quad core processors? Or is dualcore alright for this build?

2o4aob	-21160	1417577749	HomeworkHelp	[Highschool Chem] A really simple oxidation problem (for those who understand) got us into a pit of confusion?	Here's the reaction (screenshotted for convenience): http://imgur.com/zopfKsm    And right now, I'm stuck on (a).    I have the equation balanced and the oxidation states determined to be:  MnO4- + 8H+ + 2Br- ==&gt; Mn2+ + Br2 + 4H2O  Mn has an oxidation state of +7 that goes to +2  Oxygen's oxidation state stays at -2  Hydrogen's oxidation state stays at +1  Bromine's oxidation state goes from -1 to 0    Now from LEO the loin says GER, I say that Mn *gained* electrons to get to lower charge, so it *reduced*  and Br *lost* electrons to raise its charge, so it *oxidized*    Thus, according to my logic, Mn is the oxidizing agent while Br is the reducing agent.    However, a friend says that Mn gained electrons, so it oxidized? I'm confused, and just want to double check that I'm right.     Any help is appreciated, thanks.

2rxpm6	-21160	1420865816	battlefield_4	[Request] When a player knifes another player they should be vulnerable to damage while still hurting his victim	Yes I know, /r/titlegore    But here's what I mean:   If the enemy is knifing a teammate and you shoot at him, instead of the game making him invincible until the animation is done, you should be able to kill him and there will be damage dealt your teammate who was being knifed. The amount of damage dealt should depend on how long the enemy was knifing the teammate before he got shot. In my opinion, getting knifed should put you down to critical health regardless of when the enemy dies (so somewhere around the 20%-ish range), and thus you are still vulnerable. If you are shot again by any gun, you will die, awarding the knifer with an "assist counts as kill".  I understand how this may sound like a big nerf to the knife, a weapon that really doesn't need a nerf. But if the enemy knifes a teammate and the knife is already in the throat, then the player still dies. This is just to stop those annoying times where you see an enemy attack a teammate, unload your magazine into the enemy hoping to save the teammate (remember, you *can* save your teammate from being knifed if you are quick enough), and have to deal with the enemy player with a pistol. It has happened that I, along with many other players, have died because the enemy player was invincible, and the moment he got out of the animation he was able to pull off a kill.    This is just my suggestion, if the community agrees with me then thats great, but if everyone thinks its a terrible idea, then sorry for wasting your time :)

2y6dkf	-21160	1425677002	islam	/r/Islam, is Sharia law Fard (obligatory), and must be followed?	So I've been researching a bit over Islamic history, especially about the Ottoman empire, and saw that at one point (during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent) that a type of law called "Kanun law" overtook Sharia law due to its secular aspects. It got me thinking, in a state that the leader is a Muslim and the government is structured off of Islam, is Sharia Fard? Or is it something that doesn't have to be followed (like what we see in places like Turkey)? Remember that although a lot of Sharia is set in stone, it is an evolving system with the world going to new frontiers.

If I was to not pull up all the way the pain is nonexistent (which is why some may think I'm lazy when I row since I don't go up all the way). The pain, which only happens in my right heel for some reason, is a burning sensation, like my muscle is ripping. Its a painful sensation and sometimes persists after a workout (my right heel hurts as I type this, even though its been hours since I finished rowing). I've talked to my coach about it and plan on bringing it up again as she kinda dismissed it as improper stretching and beginner's symptoms.     To clarify, I am a pretty good runner and know how/when to stretch my legs and body. I've never had this pain, like ever, and its almost impossible to recreate out of the boat or erg. The pain is enough to make me consider drop rowing as a sport (something I *really* don't want to do) and go see my doctor over the pain. But I don't want to go that far just yet, so I was hoping someone could give me insight as to why I'm having this pain and what I can do to prevent it.    If you are still unsure about anything about the pain, then you can of course ask me, and thanks so much in advance for any help.

I'm working on a powerpoint for my Arab Civ class over the military successes in early Islam, and am having troubles finding some information over a few topics.    I need to overview the Muslim soldier (i.e. how he differed from other soldiers) for a few minutes. I remember reading somewhere that the Muslim soldier was lighter armed and more mobile than many other soldiers. But other than that, I have no idea what he looked like, how the Muslim Army was structured, and what innovations they brought fourth with the art of war. Basically, you can answer the question, "What made the Muslim soldier so much more efficient and effective than other Arabs at the time?"      Also, I *somewhat* understand how a war went in Arabia at the time. From what I understand, it goes somewhat like this: Armies meet up, a few words are exchanged, poetry battles, 1v1 duels ensued (which was said to indicate who would win the war), and finally a clash of armies by charging at each other. If I'm wrong or missed anything out, then please pitch in!    Also, if someone could help me out with how Islam changing the ethics of war and Islam's impact on war seen all the way up to today, that'd be amazing!  Now, keep in mind, **this is a school project, so I need sources!** You don't need to give me a very detailed outline of everything about the Muslim army, but if you could refer to me some sites/books, that'd be fine. If you can't get any sources, then I guess a simple answer here could suffice. Of course, I am doing my own research too, and I already have a few journals and books selected.        If anyone is wondering what I have so far, I have this excellent narration by Abu Bakar that goes:    *O people! I charge you with ten rules; learn them well!Stop, O people, that I may give you ten rules for your guidance in the battlefield. Do not commit treachery or deviate from the right path. You must not mutilate dead bodies. Neither kill a child, nor a woman, nor an aged man. Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire, especially those which are fruitful. Slay not any of the enemy's flock, save for your food. You are likely to pass by people who have devoted their lives to monastic services; leave them alone!*      I've also studied the initial Muslim wars in **great** detail, so I'll have fun explaining those to my class. If people here want me to, I can even upload my finished powerpoint to be used by others (it is *very* good looking if I say so myself). If intrested, then of course leave a comment asking me!

Okay so a few days ago someone here asked for some good Thunder-themed wallpapers for his phone. Not many people responded, and I couldn't really tell him how to get them himself since I was mobile. Since then, I forgot to reply (until now).    So here it is, random internet stranger and everyone else who wants to know:    There's first a few things you need to understand about devices with screens: resolution. That, it layman's terms, is the amount of pixels (or one individual light that in screen) your screen has. To give you an example, here is a [1920 x 1080 picture](http://imgur.com/EdUHf2a) (sorry for the dank MSPaint skills). It has 1920 pixels horizontally and 1080 pixels vertically Thus, if you're looking for a wallpaper, it should have the same pixel dimensions as your device's screen (more on that later).  Now you may already know the size of your device's resolution. If not, you can google your monitor or laptop's name and it should be found there. If you want to find your mobile device's resolution, try using gsmarena.com. Most mobile devices have either a 720p, 1080p, or 1440p display. But if you're Apple, you're too cool to run on that social convention and you have some weird resolutions. Use GSM Arena to find that out.    Now a big misconception in mobile devices I see is when people say "This phone has a 1920x1080p display!" No it doesn't. Refer to that terrible picture I linked up above. If you mobile device had that screen resolution, it would be wider than long, right? That's because it's resolution would be *1080 by 1920p!* Therefore, a 1080p phone is basically your everyday 1080p monitor, tilted to portrait, and shrunk down to ~5 inches.    ||*****||   **Okay so enough ramble. How do I actually get a good wallpaper for my damn PC/phone?!**  The easiest way is by searching it on Google. Here are the steps for searching for pictures of a certain resolution:     1. Go to google.com/images  2. Search up whatever you want. For this [example](http://imgur.com/bMrshc0), I'm using "OKC Thunder" as an example, but you can search up literally whatever you want your wallpaper to be.  3. [Click on "search tools"](http://imgur.com/LjN1mqq)   4. [Then click on "size" and then "exactly.](http://imgur.com/qNW7O86)   5. [Now type in the resolution of your display as we determined earlier.](http://imgur.com/EqSp4ba) Notice there's a difference in "width" and "height". In this example, I'm getting pictures for a phone, so the width is 1080 while the height is 1920. For a laptop/computer, the height would be 1080 while the width would be 1920. To make it easier, look at your device's display. Is it longer than wide or wider than long?  6. [Now click "Go" and voila! You got yourself the wallpapers you need!](http://imgur.com/n5KX17w)     [Now if you're too lazy, here's the end search result. This would work on mobile devices such as the iPhone 6/6 plus.](https://www.google.com/search?q=OKC+Thunder&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=isz:ex,iszw:1080,iszh:1920&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=989)   ||*****||   Okay so a few things to note before I leave:       * Many Android phones have what is called as "wallpaper scrolling". [Here's a demo of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbuOgxj2bZs&amp;user=iPhoneHacksTV) (albeit on a jailbroken iPhone). Look at the wallpaper. It scrolls along as you swipe from screen to screen, creating this cool *parallax* effect. Thus, for Android users who want to use wallpaper scrolling, I would recommend using a full blown 1920x1080 (not 1080x1920) image. I have a few linked below.   * [Screen revolutions come in proportional sizes.](http://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Resolution-comparison.jpg) What I mean by that is that although your device maybe 1920x1080p, a 2560x144p wallpaper would still work on it, because the length to width ratio is the same. In fact, ins some ways, a 1440p image would be higher quality than a 1080p image. Thus you can use 2560x1440p or even 3840x2560p (aka 4k) images as 1080p wallpapers. The opposite is true. If you have a 2560x1440p monitor, you *could* use a 1080p picture as your wallpaper, but it would be pretty fuzzy and blurry since the pixels would have to be stretched.  * [As promised, here is a gallery of some Thunder-themed wallpapers, most of them are 1920x1080p with a few 2560x1440p ones. These are fit for most monitors and some Android phones.](http://imgur.com/a/APNKw). Credit to these wallpapers go to their respective owners.

3g7pjt	-21160	1439009673	islam	Our mosque's dilemma with transgender peoples. [Help needed!]	Okay so this may be a controversial post so I'll say it here: Everything said here is of my own opinion, which can be wrong and can change.    I would like to note that **there's a MASSIVE difference between homesexuals and transgender people, and they must be treated differently here!**    Salam brothers and sisters, Muslim or not. Last night our mosque was faced with a problem that we've never encountered. Though it is unique right now, we expect this to become a growing issue so it's best that mosques around America (and around the globe) start discussing this now and finding out what is the right thing to do: religiously, morally, legally, and politically. And this is transgender people and where they belong in mosques. This of course has been an issue before of course, but with the recent LGBT movement, we're seeing an influx of people identifying as something different than what they physically are.    Now here's one of few problems for anyone who isn't familiar: Masjids are almost always separated by gender. The same way how male and females are assigned specific restrooms and changing rooms, along with some seating arrangements in classrooms and the sort, males and females typically have their own set of praying rooms, restrooms, kitchens and other facilities. At the very least, men are told to sit in front, while women are told to sit behind the men. This isn't to discriminate between men and women (as both men and women are split, and neither is being treated better than the other), but itis simply to allow both genders to pray and meditate in comfort and peace while respecting one core aspect of Islam: modesty.     However, transgender people hold a special place in mosques. For example, last night, a MtF (so a male by physical body, though they identify as a female) came to our mosque and insisted on sitting with the ladies. This is an obvious issue as it compromises the respect and modesty of the females at our mosque and many were complaining afterwards that they felt uncomfortable with that individual  there.    Now therein lies the problem. This specific individual converted to Islam recently and was physically a male (not a hermaphrodite). As far as I've learned, Islam treats such individuals as the identity their body possesses and not what they identify as. Thus, this individual has the obligations of a male in Islam and is treated as such. Therefore, at least from my logic (which, again could be wrong) such a person should sit amongst the men since they are physically a male. This has nothing to do with sexual orientation (as we don't know this person's sexual orientation, and frankly, it shouldn't be a problem right now).   For any non-Muslims who are wondering what the big issue is, it is equivalent to a male walking into a female restroom since he "identifies" as a female. I feel as if it is controversial to say this, that is, in my opinion, simply wrong.Females in the restroom would feel uncomfortable for a person who is physically a male to be sharing a restroom with females. The same goes vice versa, of course. A female inside a male bathroom would ensue a similar response.    However, with all the media attention surrounding such topics, it would be wrong to simply tell such a person to go into the men's side or else. We first feared that this may have been an attempt to gain negative publicity towards our mosque (as it has happened before at our mosque). However, as time went on, we firmly believe this is a person who has found the true path of Islam and is honestly confused as to who they are(religiously). This person is not here to make trouble simply put. Still however, with the possible legal and social issues, we are stuck in a very hard place as we decide how such people are categorized.     Currently, our mosque is contacting some scholars and people of knowledge to see the religious views on this issue, along with CAIR (the Council on American-Islamic relations) for the legal views on this. But I decided to post here to get some other opinions. Of course, Reddit is pretty openly liberal, but even with amongst very liberal views, a line should be drawn. And, in my opinion, this is where it should be.    TL;DR: A trans female came into the mosque and is trying to stay in the females side. We are left confused as to how we should handle this issue.    #EDITS:    **EDIT #1**: As this is a developing situation, my thoughts are still not fully formed on this issue, and neither is the masjid's. Thus, I'll be updating this post as new things unfold, Inshallah. Keep this post bookmarked if you're interested!    **EDIT #2**: Sorry if I didn't keep up with everyone today as I was *very* busy. As far as development amongst the masjid's policy goes, there is no real change. One thing we have all agreed on in the masjid is that we have *a lot* of time to make a solid and fair policy on this issue. There will be a meeting amongst some of the people on the masjid's committee to discuss this issue soon, I hear.    I would like to mention a few things though:    * \#1 The most popular solution to this problem proposed here is to make an isolated area for this person. This was brought up before in our discussion at the mosque and is being considered. This solution, however, has two problems: First, our mosque is pretty small and doesn't have that much room. We would like to make an area here, but we're not sure what room to isolate. Secondly, the masjid is a place where people should interact with each other and feel invited. Having an isolated room for someone may destroy that vibe. Again, this solution may very well be the one we chose, but there's still much to be worked out.    * \#2 The individual referred here converted a few weeks ago to the head of the mosque. They do not understand much about Islam, so as they learn, their stance may change.   * \#3 I understand that we must respect everyone in the masjid, and make sure they all feel comfortable. This includes both the transgender individual and both the men and women of the mosque. When proposing a solution, remember that you must take into account *both* parties please.    * \#4 As far as I know (a doct.or will be talking to them shortly to get any misconceptions cleared out), this person came out as a transgender rather recently and has been on hormone supplements since. This, however, may be false so take it with a grain of salt.  * \#5 Guys, please don't downvote anyone because you disagree with their opinion. This is an open discussion, so honest opinions are to be invited here, not repressed.      **EDIT #3**: IDK if anyone is still reading this thread (let me know if you do, since I wanna know if its worth the effort!), but nothing seems to have changed yet. There may be a meeting later on this week.

3gwjk4	-21160	1439503902	explainlikeimfive	ELI5: The Tianjin Explosions	So I searched it up and didn't find any questions over the explosion (in general, though [there are some specific questions](https://us.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/search?q=Tianjin+&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)), so I'll ask it:    * What exactly caused the explosions? Why were there multiple blasts?  * Who's fault (at this stage at least) is it?  * I'm reading only around 50 deaths, but from the looks of it, that number should be *much* higher. It's been almost 24 hours since the explosion? Is this the Chinese government trying to scale the disaster down, or is it just a matter of time until we see the actual death toll?  * What long term impacts will this explosions have in the area? Will there be any health concern (lets say) 30 years down the road?    There are many more questions, but these were the only things I could think up of at the top of my head
3hr4x6	-21160	1440097389	AndroidMasterRace	So due to a messed up order, I got an S6 Edge instead of the original S6. Should I keep it?	As mentioned, I got an S6 Edge while paying for a discounted S6 (~500 bucks) by accident. The seller was very apologetic and offered me a free return label and express shipping for an S6 or I can keep the Edge.   Now my last phone (the Nexus 5) broke because of a drop, so I'm *very* skeptical about the Edge. I planned on getting a case and a tampered glass screen protector for the S6, but I don't think I can do that anymore. I'm also not really sold on the features introduced in the S6, so some feedback on how you S6 Edge owners have kept up with those features.    The only thing that appeals to me really is the aesthetic and design, but even then I've heard the phone is uncomfortable to grip.    So yea, I'm getting a potential ~250$ upgrade for free, but guys help me out. Is it worth it?
3iip96	-21160	1440625433	college	Side question on BME, Pre-Med, and ECE	Hey guys, this is my first post here so sorry if its the wrong place to post this. I'm heavily considering medical school, but am torn between that and majoring in Electrical/Computer Engineering. For right now, my aim is to go to med school, and probably specialize in something like radiology and let ECE be a backup option if I decide med school isn't for me or I can't get in (hopefully not the second one).    Some people have told me a BME degree would be a good in between, while others have told me that its stupid to do BME and expect to get a masters or doctorate in ECE. I do plan on talking to my counselor and get her opinion on the matter, but I decided to ask you guys.     I've heard very contrasting opinions on BME, in and out of context of my specific situation.     As a side note, if I don't do BME, I'm also considering chem engineering, or maybe even doing straight up electrical engineering as an undergrad. People have told me how tough of a route that is, but I'm honestly up for the challenge, and I feel like its my ideal route for college. What are your opinions of such a route?  
iuemu	-21161	1311127041	AskReddit	Is the movie "Taken" (2008) worth watching?	(I have both standard and Blu-Ray versions, if that makes a difference)[EDIT] - For those of you who saying "Who's the new guy? Read IMDB! And (insert Chris Crocker voice): Leave reddit alone!" I understand where you're coming from. If it means anything, I *did* look at rottentomatoes; *Taken* scored in the mid-40s. Solid, but not exactly stellar. Then why did I ask reddit? Because I *trust* reddit. I may be a new user (this is my first post), but I've been visiting the site for some time now, and you guys just think the way I do. So I wanted to know what you think. That's all. **tl;dr version** : reddit opinion &gt; actual movie critics. Sad realization: None of my future posts will ever do as well as this first one.

I'm talking shirts, pants, shoes, accessories, whatever. Feel free to be as detailed as you want, but just know that once these three outfits are decided, that's IT... (also, ignore the cases of athletic wear or super formal situations that need a tuxedo variant)Given your daily social environment and interactions, what three outfits would you create?EDIT: Pics are great if you have the time :) (And they say a lot more than "jeans, ocbd, boots"!)

24hb42	-21161	1398972740	dadjokes	Dad joke about power tools	I was in a guy's workshop last week waiting for him to come back from the house, and I noticed a jigsaw sitting on the table. Because he was gone awhile (and I was bored), I picked it up and turned it on. Right as I did that he came around the corner and I quickly turned it off and put it down. Me: "Nobody saw anything."Him: "Oh I definitely saw that."Me: "Yeah, but *I* didn't saw anything."
2pea3f	-21161	1418677424	workflow	List/menu "cancel" case	Hey guys,Playing around with a workflow today, and not sure how to handle the case when the user selects "cancel" in a list or menu. Ideally, I'd like to just Exit Workflow at that point, but I can't figure out how to recognize it (using an if/then statement).Do you guys have any ideas?
2pj5lc	-21161	1418780532	workflow	Play recent videos from your favorite YouTube channels (good for Chromecast)	Hey guys,Here's a workflow I made that allows you to make a list of your favorite youtubers by exact username, pull up a recent video list of the one you selected, and play one of those videos. It opens in Safari or in the dedicated YouTube app if you have it installed.https://workflow.is/workflows/a86a75e3698341b9bc1680e73c3e3a5bI hope it's useful for those of you who either watch YouTube videos on your mobile device, or if you (like me) use your YouTube app as a remote for a Chromecast or smart tv.Sorry about some of the ugly steps, but I wanted the "Cancel" case to actually exit the workflow. If you have any ways to streamline the functionality, I'd love to see it :).Customize your favorite youtubers in the first step of the workflow... I'm a fan of LPers, so that's what you see.Edit: I set up this workflow to use a list of my most common YouTubers, but obviously you could set it up to visit a custom channel based on user input. It's a pretty easy change, but let me know if you want to see my alternate version.

2zm9i4	-21161	1426793599	mindcrack	Since we're in the thanking mood.. huge thanks to Etho for helping me get a job interview!	Hey guys, I saw /u/Gregtom3 's post about how he used Kurt's story for an SAT prompt, and I want to share another story about how one of the mindcrackers helped me.I'm coming up on two years removed from college and I've really struggled to find a job in my industry since graduation. I've worked odd jobs in the meantime and made things work, but it was frustrating not to work in my field of choice and passion. A couple weeks ago I was contacted by a recruiter for a local firm and they wanted to do a job interview! I was ecstatic, and so incredibly nervous. I reviewed and reviewed, practiced my pitch, read every chintzy "10 Things You Must Absolutely Positively Say During A Phone Interview" article I could find, and generally hyped myself up beyond normal human interaction. I was a mess.But when I answered their phone call, I thought of something that I heard a long time ago. Though it's been awhile since I've had the time to actually play Minecraft, I've watched Etho's videos religiously for the last few years, and I remembered an episode where he gave advice for new youtubers. It was a simple comment, but it was something to the effect of: "Smile when you talk. The listeners can hear that smile and it puts them in a good mood".Long story short, I forced a smile when I started talking, and it worked! It made me comfortable, we actually exchanged a few jokes, and they were anxious to schedule an in-person meeting as soon as possible! I don't know how it works, but it works. So big thanks to Etho: For doing what you love, you've given me the chance to do what I love.

Some of these people have A LOT of computing power.  Here's a list of the top 100: http://boinc.berkeley.edu/chart_list.phpIf we tell them that they can support BOINC cause more by1) Donating gridcoins to scientific projects2) Hoarding gridcoins to make them more valuable and get more people interested in BOINC3) Sell grid coins to purchase more computing power … Etc…I'm sure we can get them on board.We need to find a way to reach out to them. It looks like there isn't any contact info on these individual pages but we can reach them by posting in places where BOINC participants visit such as forums.  Maybe you can contact members once you're a member yourself, IDK but it's worth trying. Just adding couple of these supercomputers to Gridcoin will raise the price a lot since price is correlated with kilo hashes on the network. 
1zoecl	-21162	1394067448	BOINC	I came across a way to earn money while running BOINC with Gridcoin.

2orm8o	-21162	1418142726	personalfinance	When to pay back student loans and when to invest?	So I have student loans at 6.8% and 3.86%. My current thought is to pay back the loans at 6.8% as quickly as possibly as this is a relatively high risk free return in the current environment and wait to pay back the loans at 3.86% as I can make more than that, risk adjusted, in the market. Is this correct? I know that the market usually returns about 7.5% but I think that return is not worth it when adjusted for risk. Thoughts?

About $5,500 is at a 6.8% interest rate unsub and the rest is at 3.86%. I'm a college senior. Is it worth it to take a loan out from my mom at an interest rate of say 3% for $5,000 so I can pay off the money at 6.86%? She says she wouldn't charge me any interest if I paid off the loan within a year. Good idea or no?
36jqnl	-21162	1432073068	Bitcoin	Frustrated by the lack of places to spend bitcoin	Recently, I have had the goal of spending bitcoin at a brick and mortar store. I thought that Cambridge would be a place where plenty of stores would accept bitcoin because of MIT's program that gave $100 worth of bitcoin to each student and because if the technical sophistication of the area. First I went to MIT's COOP because I know that they accept bitcoin but it was closed. I then went to Anna's Burritos and a convenience store on MIT's campus but neither accepted bitcoin. I decided to research online before going to another store. I looked online and saw that the Dumpling Room accepted bitcoin. I went and asked if this was the case and they respond that they had stopped accepting the currency. I looked up another place that accepted bitcoin called Veggie Galaxy and decided to eat there. When I got my check and asked to pay with bitcoin they said that they no longer accepted the currency either. Both places said that they stopped accepting bitcoin because they had very few customers that were spending bitcoin in their stores. I just wanted to vent my frustration that it is so hard to actually spend bitcoin at physical locations. Thanks for reading.

It might even be referred pain from my tmj issues?Anyway he did an x ray and he said there's a crack either between the teeth or below the gum I cant remember, and asked me If I was in a car crash (wtf) so I think it's been there years, because the last time I was hit by a person or any kind of facial trauma was when I was 21He gave me some cordosyl toothpaste and told me to stop brushing and flossing so hard. I've kinda ignored that part though since my dumb logic is that if I leave my electric tootbrush wedged in hard enough eventually it'll stop bleeding.Will this eventually clear up? Should I buy some chlorhexidine mouthwash? He said to come back if anything got worse but it's not got worse it's just the same.It only bleeds when I brush over that area the gum doesn't really hurt if touched but it slighlty stings for half a second if I push the electric toothbrush down deep inside that gum section.Thanks for your time random internet heroes.

Hunters risk pretty much nothing, 2 levels away from being able to glory teleport, magic imp boxes bank all their chins at once, which they bank every 20 chins or so) and now they splash on their alt accounts to stop you from even attacking them. The point of black chins was supposed to be that the chins were expensive as fuck due to the risk associated with hunting them, there is no risk. Now what you're left with is hunters getting insane xp, insane gp and with 0 risk, and on the off chance you do manage to kill a hunter they can just drop their loot anyway.People that farm green dragons can't put all their shit in a box at once and magically have all their loot safely banked. It's a farce.At this stage you might aswell dump some blue dragons in the black chins spot and call it a day and go chuck the black chins in a private hunting ground with the diaries update.

35lhvt	-21164	1431353194	2007scape	Vote No to the new dag kings lair requiring elite diary completition	It sets a dangerous precedent for the game to go down. It divides the community even further and makes a so called 'MMO' even less social.If you vote yes to this jagex will keep gating content behind diaries in the future eventually leading to a small subset of players being able to do certain content. If you want to tie bosses behind skills make them melee skills that actually makes sense.. what does having 82 runecrafting have to do with killing a dag king?**The original dev post said they wanted to free up the DK lair as it's too crowded, having an elite only room doesn't fix this**Two DK rooms for everybody for a 500k fee would've allowed more casual players to find an empty DK to kill as it obviously doubles the amount of dk's, instead the average players will still be fighting over the same packed spots whilst **the second lair will mostly be empty since a small fraction of players have elites completed and an even smaller fraction of them even bother to kill dk's**, and the rest are hardcore skillers who just sit around getting 200mill xp in farming.**  This is a shit tactic to make skilling more popular and not one the player base should support. **There's other ways to make skilling popular again but this is not it.**We're playing old school runescape here not rs3. Old school has never split up the community when it comes to killing bosses by adding arbritrary skilling requirements.Don't let the 24/7 diehards on this sub convince you it's a good idea to vote yes, this harms the casual playerbase which is the majority proportion of the games community. Unless In 2 years time you want to be playing a game where you need to spend thousands more hours raising all skills to 90+ ontop of leveling melee stats just to do boss content with your friends, which will result in even more botting, and more people quitting.The game is supposed to be fun, there's a reason most players just pk or do endgame bossing - it's fun. Forcing skilling requirements are a cheap way of forcing you to play for longer and line jagex's pockets through the extra months of membership you need to pay. It's not the average players fault that jagex can't think of ways to make skilling popular/useful other than this.**/u/R1shal posted a good solution which sounds perfectly reasonable by making the fee higher if you don't have elite frem diary**&gt;Or maybe 5m without diary, 500k with? That seems like a fair compromise.

Right now you have no idea that the world's lagging until it's too late... After one or two disconnects and it's all quiet you think it has passed... then an hour later it hits again.Jagex can definitely detect an incomming DDOS before it completely shuts the world down.Seeing as this sub gets defensive when you suggest jagex actually spends money on getting this fixed atleast there could something small like this done in the meantime?**edit: Infact as soon as they notice a DDOS why don't they just FORCE LOG EVERYBODY out of that world like they do after 6 hours of being logged in, that would remove the incentive to DDOS the world since nobody can die or get loot if nobody is logged in**

I don't want to hop onto the /r/2007scape John C negativity train but.. all I did was pk between 2005-2007 never saw a G maul spec do this.It doesn't add up, a 50% chance of it hitting somebody else but not one single video or thread complaining about it? A bug that HUGE wouldn't go unnoticed.I didn't play old school when it was first released but still somebody would've posted a video by now in one of them many threads asking why they nerfed the G maul showing the issue.

The official client is awful and adding all the features the way they do now simply clutters the user interface and tends to be a poorer experience than using a third party client. Hell they could even chuck an ad on the right hand side where osbuddy/rune loader shows the world switcher for all I care.  Now with chrome and the other browser's dropping Java is a perfect time for Jagex to release a great client and nobody would have an advantage since everybody is using a client now that the browser is dead.TLdr; official injection client allows for a better UI 0 Engine workFaster implementations of client features3rd party client parity

I bought this game back when I was maybe in 4th - 5th grade ( would be about 9-10 years ago ) from the book fair at school which I want to say was Scholastic. The setting was in a hospital and you were given a patients symptoms have a certain time frame to treat them. I remember specifically if you didn't work quickly enough and time was up, a foot with a toe tag would pop up on screen. It scared me so bad my dad ended up throwing it in the trash as it would cause me LOADS of anxiety and I feel like there's no way that game should have been intended for children. Does anyone remember this game?

18t66r	-21165	1361264856	Parenting	11 month old throwing tantrums?	My son will be a year old March 7th, and for about a good month or so he's been throwing these awful tantrums and acting aggressive when not getting his way. Mainly, this happens when I take something he can't have or I'm getting him out of the bath. He nose dives into the floor, screams, hits and attempts to bite if I'm within his reach. I've tried calmly telling him it's not nice, a stern no!, and ignoring it the best I can at this point but it's only seemingly getting worse as he gets older and more aware. It's a little concerning.I'm mostly wondering if there's a different approach I could take to his fits, and if this is "normal" for an infant his age. Thoughts and advice will be much appreciated ! 
1aefak	-21165	1363418745	Parenting	13 month old suddenly decided he doesn't want to sleep in his crib..	My 13 month old son has recently ( this past week ) decided he doesn't want to sleep in his crib. Period. We do his usual bath, bottle, and rocking and no sooner does his head hit the pillow he's screaming and throwing a full blown tantrum until he's picked back up and put in bed with me. Great. This wouldn't be an issue if my room wasn't a partially open loft on the top floor. Even with a baby gate, I'm still really uncomfortable so lately it's been me hardly dozing off all night and him sleeping like a dream in my bed.I've tried letting him fuss and cry it out as a last resort but learned quickly he *is* relentless. I'm completely unsure what to do now, I'm so tired and wish I could just crawl in his crib with him. Haha.Anyone suggestions would be *fantastic*.
1ax3h9	-21165	1364143151	Parenting	13 month old suddenly refusing milk..	I have no idea what to do.He switched over to whole milk at 11 1/2 months and never had an issue with it until now. He's only drinking one 8oz bottle if that, at night time before he goes to bed. Other than that, he won't even look at his bottle if it's milk. He's still wanting to drink juice and eating three balanced meals a day so I doubt it's a throat/teething issue but this concerns me because he's always been in a very low percentile for his age ( barely 20lbs now ) and I don't want him to lose any weight without the extra calories he gets from the whole milk. I have also tried carnation but he refused that also ):Wondering if anyone else has had this issue or have any advice? Is whole milk absolutely essential at his age or could he do without?
1dmx6m	-21165	1367608731	Parenting	14 month old refusing to eat?	As of two days ago, my 14 month old flat out ( for the most part ) refuses to eat. He will take a bite, maybe two, then spit it out.I'm offering him *everything*, including pasta and avocados which before this he absolutely couldn't get enough of.  I just don't get it, he's his usual happy, high energy, self.. just *not* eating. I know he's cutting a few molars if that counts, but he doesn't seem in pain or anything. Wondering if maybe that has to do with it or if I should be alarmed? I'm pretty frustrated at this point even though I know I shouldn't be.  
1pv498	-21165	1383550904	Parenting	"Hyperactive" 20 month old..	Like the title says, my 20 month old son is over the top hyper, 24 hours a day. He practically bounces off walls and hardly even stops to eat anymore. He takes an hour/hour and a half nap ( if I'm lucky ), goes to bed around 830-ish, wakes up at 7am, and the rest of the day he spends running and generally acting like a maniac.His pediatrician isn't all that worried and I really wasn't either until the other day when I attended a baby shower and couldn't help but notice the difference between him and other children his age who were all sitting quietly with their moms while my son went around sprinting and trying to get into *everything*. It made me feel like the rest of the parents thought I was raising a real brat :(  I'm just wondering if anyone else can relate to this and *if* I should be concerned? Suggestions? Anything.
1szpew	-21165	1387175811	Parenting	Toddler is terrified of the potty :(	This weekend we decided to give potty training a go and it was an absolute nightmare! I went out and bought a potty, stickers, and big boy undies and my son ( 22 months ) was just flat-out *not* having it. No amount of bribery or coaxing could get him to even sit on it without turning into a limp noodle and screaming. He seems to be scared that he's going to fall backwards ( even though it has a back ) or actually in it. Huge bummer :(Does anyone here have any tips for this? Should I wait it out or get a different potty? Approach it a different way? I'm fresh out of ideas.

25okj6	-21165	1400208590	Parenting	Uncircumcised son.. Need advice.	Earlier today I took my 2 year old son to the ER for some serious pain while urinating. I thought *maybe* a UTI but the tip of his foreskin did look a bit swollen and irritated. Not a huge deal. We get there and the nurse decided to take a urine sample and do an ultrasound on his bladder and kidneys which was easy enough and she thought he just had a UTI as well, so we waited on that and for the a doc to come in. She took one look at my sons penis and says his foreskin has fused over the urethra, that's the reason he's in pain, and I *need* to have him circumcised immediately!? I'm so confused. I can clearly see his urethral opening just fine when I change him. I've never noticed anything that looks abnormal and he's never had a single issue until today. Anyway, turns out he does have a UTI so they gave him antibiotics but also made me him an appointment with their urologist and urged me to get him circumcised :( Has anyone else had this issue? I feel really awful and bullied by them into all of this. His pediatrician ( who has intact kids ) says everything looks great at every appointment so I have no idea what to think other than to maybe make an appt. with her tomorrow and get her opinion instead. Thanks.UPDATE: After starting my son on antibiotics last night, he woke up this morning like a new kid. He's urinating without issue and the redness/irritation is completely gone as well. I took him to his regular pediatrician and she said she doesn't see a single problem with his foreskin. No fusing, no adhesions, ect. She couldn't believe they had talked about whisking him off to surgery last night to circumcise him! I'm beyond relieved but furious with the ER staff for the way I was treated. I will *never* go back to that particular hospital and I've already called to file a complaint against that nurse but haven't gotten a call back yet.Thank you to everyone!

I have them in a window with not too much direct sunlight, fast draining  cactus soil, and don't *think* I'm over watering but I could be? They continue to get new growth but the bottom leaves keep wilting and falling off. I also have a forest frost and a moon cactus that seem to be thriving so I'm lost. Can anyone help me help these little guys? :(

28l0au	-21166	1403210248	Advice	Working as an intern, offered a full-time job that I don't want	I started working as a technical writing intern a few months ago, and I've found that I don't really like it (I'm an English major, and I thought it would be a good way to make money, but it turns out to be really boring and meaningless). I was told upon being hired that the internship could last between 6 months and a year, and that there was a possibility of being hired full-time after that. However, my managers are trying to get more help on the documentation side of things so they've offered me a full-time position. I don't really like technical writing, I don't think I'm very good at it, and I don't want to take a full-time job, but I also want to keep this internship job for a few more months until I can find something else. I've applied and interviewed for the position because my managers encouraged me to, and they've told me that I basically have it...what should I do?

Would it be possible (given a means of transportation/observation) to find a habitable, atmosphere-endowed planet with flora and fauna, but no variance in seasons (like, no winter)?

One thing that stood out to me, though, was how much Zach seemed to be enjoying himself. Of course, they were all energetic and fun, but Zach seemed especially into it, mouthing the words to most of the songs and trying to ramp up the crowd's excitement. Is it because it's one of his first big tours with Coheed? Anyway, I'm glad they brought him on; he seems like a cool guy and an excellent bassist.

I heard this [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGzi2W_3H3U) on the radio several months ago, and since then I've had the tune stuck in my head but I couldn't find it anywhere. I checked the radio station's playlist, but for some reason the song didn't show up. I finally found it using an online classical music database and a virtual piano. It's the 4th part of Mozart's Serenade #12 in C minor. I love it, it's so whimsical; It reminds of music from the old cartoon Little Bear.

2llq8i	-21166	1415386332	classicalmusic	Nostalgic Pieces	On my quiet playlist, there are three songs in particular that I listen to often, and I notice that they always bring about a deep sense of nostalgia. The feeling can be quite addicting:[Rêverie (Debussy)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5ot-88UV-Y), [Adagio from Concerto Grosso Op. 6 No. 8 in G Minor (Corelli)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9Cu6DZO8nI), [Holberg Suite, Op. 40 - IV. Air (Grieg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo27diVvguw)I'm not sure if the composers actually had nostalgia in mind when they wrote these pieces, but I feel that certain music has qualities that lend themselves to nostalgia (whether that be happy or sad). Are there other songs that produce this feeling? Please share any songs that you feel are written particularly to evoke nostalgia. They can be major or minor, happy or sad. (P.S. I would have mentioned Clair de Lune as well, but I feel like it's so well known that most people know what it sounds like)Edit: Someone else on /r/Music was asking about songs like Clair De Lune, and there were quite a few good suggestions there:http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/2llqp7/debussy_clair_de_lune_looking_for_more_pieces/

2rs3ri	-21166	1420749621	gradadmissions	Applying to more than one program at same school?	I've recently been having serious doubts about the direction I want to head with my graduate studies, and I'm considering applying to other programs. My top school has a program that I'm really interested in, but I've already applied for another program. Would it be unwise to apply to another program at the same school? It's in a completely different college...will the admissions committee know that I've applied to two programs?Update: So I called the adviser at the department where I'm wanting to apply, and she said that since the admissions committee for their department only sees applications for their department, they wouldn't know that I had applied to another program at the University. Therefore, my having applied to two programs shouldn't have any affect on the outcome of either application, since the overall University admissions only looks at GPA and transcripts before passing those applications to specific departments. So, I'll probably apply to this other program as well. (I'm posting this update just in case someone else is looking for information about this topic. I'm applying to University of Utah, if that helps)

That's Jonathan Scarfe, who played Joseph Smith in the Work and the Glory movies. The best part about seeing him on the show? He plays a werewolf who is disguised as a pastor and has a congregation who literally transform into sheep. He dupes them out of their money and has affairs with members of the congregation. This *can't* be a coincidence...but if it is, it's a hilarious one.
2xt6d1	-21166	1425406114	gradadmissions	Problem with Acceptance	So, I applied for two different Master's programs at the same school. One program already got back to me about two weeks ago with an offer of admission, and since it was the one that I really wanted, I accepted. Unfortunately, I just received word from the other program that I applied for and they want to offer me admission as well; however, they're also offering partial funding (the other program didn't offer any funding). This includes half-tuition waiver, health care benefits, and a pretty decent yearly stipend. This program isn't really aligned with my current career goals, but it is in a subject area that I am interested in. Is it possible to reneg on my initial acceptance, and would it be a good idea to do so?

You were messaging my friend tonight on Facebook and you sent him the CES letter. He opened it (hasn't read it yet, he was trying to hide the conversation from me) and he seemed very pensive and quiet the rest of the night, I assume because of your conversation. He doesn't know I'm exmo, and I feel that telling him outright could be harmful to our friendship, but it would really be nice to have a friend to talk to...so for both our sakes, do as the missionaries do and follow up with him, ask if he read it, and keep encouraging him.

30dn3h	-21166	1427382319	exmormon	The Blind House	This morning I was listening to a song by Porcupine Tree (one of my favorite bands) called "The Blind House". I'd never really paid attention to the lyrics, so this morning it kind of dawned on me: this song is about a cult. So I looked up a bit of information about the song, and it turns out Steven Wilson (frontman) mentioned that the lyrics were inspired by the YFZ Ranch Raid...i.e., a raid on a FLDS community, where women and teenagers were being sexually and physically abused. [Here's some information on the YFZ Ranch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YFZ_Ranch#April_2008_raid), and [here's the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_KcaSgClrM). (Sorry if you're not into this type of music, it can get a little heavy). I thought this was worth bringing up here, because although this is about a raid on an FLDS community, the song's lyrics are very applicable both to LDS church history and the modern LDS church, and to cult worship in general.Edit - Here are the lyrics:If you wanna stayAlways hereAll these yearsThe last frontierIt's no concern of theirsThe world outsideCorrupts my childSo trust these eyesFaith is in your soulBut in these wallsHormones stallDogs will crawlThe vices and the doubtWe resistAll this shitSo kneel submitFree loveFree loveFeel love in all my sistersBreathe outBlind houseYou don't need to know their secretsBelieve mePray and violateAbuse your trustFalse gods mustPurge their lustA family that liesTo seal your fateTo take the weightOf their self-hateFree loveFree loveBring love to all my sistersBreathe outBlind houseYou don't need to know their secretsBelieve meBreathe outBlind houseFree loveFeel loved
32iy2l	-21166	1428984030	legaladvice	Bought a Car, Bank has Title	So, I did something stupid...and I'm ready for your jabs, because I feel like an idiot. I bought a car a little over a week ago from a private owner, who told me that she needed to pay off the lien on the car's title before she could sign it over. Like the idiot I am, I agreed and transferred the money to her (we were together at the bank). She signed a copy of the bank transaction and wrote "Bill of Sale" on it, which she assured me could be used to get a temporary registration while we waited for the title. I went to the DMV, and it turns out the "Bill of Sale" she signed isn't valid because it doesn't have any information about the car on it. This may have been intentional on her part, but I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt. I texted her every couple of days asking for news on the title, and she kept telling me that she should have it by the end of the week. On Friday of last week, I texted her but didn't get a response. I texted again on Saturday, no response. I called her today but she didn't pick up, so I left a message. She still hasn't responded, and now I'm starting to get worried. I know where she lives, I have her phone number, I have her signature on a copy of the bank transfer, I have three witnesses (friends) who were there when I paid her, and the car is still under her name (which I assume means she would still be responsible for paying tickets or whatever), so I don't see why she would stop responding or try to take advantage of me. I did a history report, and the car isn't stolen or anything. Does anyone have advice on what to do with this? Am I just being paranoid? I'm currently in Utah. Update: So she called me today (finally) and is going to meet with me to give me an updated Bill of Sale so that I can get a temporary registration for the car. She said that her bank initially told her she could access the title online, but now she's found out that she has to pay to have them send it to her by mail. I didn't ask why she couldn't contact me before, but I suppose it doesn't matter now. Thanks for the help, everyone!

289jfh	-21167	1402905098	iRacing	V8 Supercar vs Cadillac CTS-V	I started iRacing about 8-9 days ago and the first thing I did was buy a V8 Supercar and Mount Panorama. I did a couple hours of practise and eventually got the hang of the car to do a safe lap.Ever since then I was trying to get my license out of Rookie to C so I could start racing the V8 Supercar series. I mostly enjoyed The Global Challenge running with the Cadillac CTS-V. I thought the CTS-V had a similar feel to the V8SC.I recently got my C license and thought I would give a practise run with the V8SC again on Mount Panorama. I had gotten so used to the other cars I had forgotten how much of a handfull the V8SC was and almost spun just leaving the pits. It took all my focus just to get a lap done without getting some form of Incident.After I had finished with the V8SC I decided to run the same track with the CTS-V and wow I swear the CTS-V is a tame puppy compared to the beast that is the V8 Supercar.I feel I will need a couple days to get the hang of the V8 properly again.TL;DR Got used to V8SC when joined. Got license to point so I could use it. Couldn't handle the V8SC over a week later.

Teams consisting of 4 members, 1 rabbit(Legend) and 3 defenders(Street Stock)The rabbit's race and the other 3 guys try to defend and wreck the others, with fast towing and fast repair enabled.This idea was brought to my attention by /u/Yazidguile I thought this could be a lot of fun if we get enough people interested.EDIT: I would like to get some idea on how many people would be interested in joining an event like this.Also any special settings I should change maybe something like low fuel limit for the Street Stocks.EDIT2: Thinking of organizing this on a Saturday 8pm for you guys (same as Sunday I believe).EDIT3: Session is scheduled for Saturday at 8pm. Unsure if I can make it so RiL can see beforehand.
28okf3	-21167	1403306086	RiL	The Rabbit Race! - Teams	We need to organize teams for the race on Saturday at 8pm.Post in here if you would like to be a Rabbit (Legends) or a Defender (Street Stock).From that point we can start teaming people together once we have numbers. Or you can post a team yourself.EDIT: One quick rule: You must go the correct direction around the track. No turning around driving the wrong way.Team "Wicked Mod of the East": /u/rustyshackleford10  (Rabbit), /u/ajleece (Defender) and /u/k0rta (Defender).Team "Pending a better name": /u/CrabCow (Rabbit), /u/AndyBatch (Defender) and /u/Johnnwho (Defender)./u/me_not_you_not_you  as numbers are not even you can be what ever you want. If you choose to be a rabbit you will not have any defenders. You can be a "Defender" and just cause all out Chaos if you wish. :)

293v87	-21167	1403742005	RiL	I think I am getting addicted to this game already.	I just noticed that I have bought 5 tracks and 2 cars in the short time I have been playing iRacing (3 weeks).

29j626	-21167	1404184347	RiL	Flair?	Just curious. Is it possible to add flair. I wouldn't mind being able to add the car number I usually use in iRacing for our events. :)
29jz3y	-21167	1404213457	RiL	Tip's please :) GT3 @ Spa	Hey guys just wondering if you have any tips for racing the GT3's at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps. So far I have practised 20-30 laps in the BMW Z4 GT3 getting laps around 2:27 (I am presuming that is fairly slow but it beats my initial almost 3:00 laps).Any parts of the track that may seem slow that I should probably risk going fast at or little tricks would be greatly appreciated. I will continue doing laps around the track every now and again through the days leading up to the endurance race.I am very keen for it and loving the feel of the BMW Z4 GT3 specially compared to the skippy's haha.EDIT: Here is a video of one of my faster laps (Warning I screw up a few times) aprox 2:25.6 http://youtu.be/WHnwUvc52oQ

2a3rim	-21167	1404783283	iRacing	Graphics!	Hey guys. I have had my graphics set to high the entire time but recently I have noticed for some reason that things like my speed dials and decals on track walls/cars have been blurry yet settings are still all as high as they can go.The only difference is I am now running on 3 monitors. My GPU is more than capable of running with 3 on the highest settings @ 60fps.Just curious if anyone knows of a possible solution or cause.EDIT: Fixed by to eliminate the blur, turn the two sliders at the bottom up as far as they will go or that your card can handle, this should rid you off all blur.

2abhqu	-21167	1404983136	iRacing	Close finishes are extremely satisfying!	Just had a very close finish of 0.036 seconds between us crossing the finish line. I had been slowly edging up over the last few laps.http://youtu.be/HEvbXNsm3XAProbably skip to 2 minute mark for the more interesting part.Started 14th in the pits ending up 4th. So many wrecks to dodge.

I have a spare copy of Tropico 4 from my latest HumbleBundle purchase and thought I should give it to someone here on PCMR. First PM get's it. If I do not respond it is because I have already given the game away.EDIT: Given away very quickly. Anyone interested in one of the other games I got from the bundle? I only really wanted Euro Truck Simulator 2 and I have these games left. Please state which one you would like:~~-Cook, Serve, Delicious!~~~~-Universe Sandbox~~~~-Out of the Park Baseball 14~~~~-Turbo Dismount~~EDIT: All games given away.
2bdxlv	-21167	1406029816	RiL	Street Stocks on the Road!	I must say I really enjoyed the chaotic attempt at handling the Street Stocks on a Road course.

I am not sure which road track to race them on and thought we could discuss it.I was thinking about Mount Panorama but that seems like a death trap! But then again. Thoughts?

Straight up I hate how it is built for touch screen on a PC and wish they had a seperate version or something for Tablet's/ Touchscreen laptops.

3e7v1u	-21171	1437584629	glasgow	A Century Of Elvis	We were sitting in the living room on the sofa, the wrong way round, looking out the window. It was quiet, and then in the car park across the road we saw Elvis – look, there beside the postman’s van, and he was walking round the postman’s van, looking in the open door. He looked as if he was thinking about getting in, but then the postman came back, and he swaggered off, walked past the window and down the stairs, and then at the bottom of the stairs right by the caretaker’s office, he started licking the pavement. Every night now since we moved in that new house there’s this noise outside the door at just about half seven or eight o’ clock every night. And if we go and look outside the door, Elvis’ll be standing there waiting to be let in. And then he wanders into the living room, maybe sits down on one of the chairs or even lies down on the floor. He doesn’t say much, he just stays there for an hour or two, watching the TV. We talk to him a bit, and then around ten o’ clock, he’ll go away again, and not come back until the next night. There’s a lot of lanes and stuff around here, around the house – although it’s right in the middle of the city it seems quite like the country, it’s dead hidden – safe I suppose, made for night living. There’s a lot of squirrels and birds, and Stuart says he’s seen about nine foxes there when he’s jumped over the fence on his way to Prior’s Road. Sometimes you can go out walking, and when you’ve been out for a wee while even you don’t know where you are anymore, so it would be pretty hard for anyone else to find you. I suppose that’s why he spends so much time there, that’s why he’s come to live there, or maybe it’s just the squirrels. I read about somewhere that he likes squirrels quite a lot. There’s these two videos that we got for wedding presents – called the e-files, e-files one and e-files two about how Elvis is supposed to be still alive. And one time when he came round we were watching one of those, but he didn’t say anything he just sat on the armchair. He was playing with his collar a bit, and we watched it right through and then when it finished he just got up and walked off into the mist and didn’t say anything. the first few times he came round I didn’t speak to him at all, I wasn’t really sure what to say. And Karen spoke to him quite a lot – she seemed to know what to do more than I do. He had quite a strange manner though, he’d go into your stuff and look through it, then he’d maybe pick something up and play with it for a wee while, but he’d never make any comment about any of it. Seemed pretty rude to me. I just watched whatever Karen did, and listened to how she talked to him and then, after a while I started to copy that, and tell him a few things, not really bothered about whether he responded or said anything back or not. I think the first time I spoke to him we were sitting up on the mezzanine and I said that I would tell him about me and wee Karen, and how it was that we’d come to be living there. I thought he probably liked the fact that we were living there because he came round so much, so I thought he might want to know how it was that it came about. We did it all over backwards, I told him. First of all we got to know each other, and then a while after that we met, and when we’d known each other for about seven years we decided to have an anniversary, and that went quite well, so after the anniversary we had a honeymoon, and that went well too, so after that we decided that we would get married. That’s why we’re living there now. I used to think my dad was Elvis, but I haven’t told him that yet. I haven’t told my dad either…

I sometimes feel there's not enough icons in the game (and I'm not talking about the flags).They could cost the same as the god icons or maybe less.What do you guys think?

2j5zgc	-21186	1413243994	PipeTobacco	Idea : POSSIBLE solution to stem oxidation.	Hello.I am sure this isn't the first idea of its kind, but it is something I have been pondering. Oxidation seems to be a real pain, with no 100% method of preventing it.As my main passion and hobbies are related to the automotive world, I started trying to think of something from that realm to fix it.The idea.... Clear Automotive Acrylic coating on your stems.Does anyone know of anything like this having been used before?I imagine a stem could be restored, polished, and then clear coated, which should prevent oxidation on the surface.Again, I may be completely wrong. I am chatting to a spray painter mate about it who also imagines it would work.I don't see there would be any negative health dangers from it, it will be cured rick solid, and won't leech chemicals over it's life, and would also prevent teeth damaging the stems.Thoughts? Or evidence against it?Thanks :)

Other newbies, give it a try, it definitely worked for me.

It nearly knocked me on my ass! I have only been smoking for around a month now. The taste is amazing, very smooth and heavy. I hopped up out of my seat to move inside and I feel like I have just taken a heap of codeine and maybe a little oxycontin. It normally takes me a few glasses of red to surrender me to a lie on the couch like this. This stuff is amazing.

2ky0vt	-21186	1414807642	pipetobaccomarket	Hi all. [WTB] Estate pipes / unwanted pipes / TLC needing pipes	Hi all.I have recently gotten into pipe smoking and have decided to turn my hand at pipe restoration, as a hobby, and to build my new collection.I am pretty handy on the tools, especially with cars, but I have just had my 5th shoulder reconstruction in 3 years so I am taking up a less intensive constructive hobby.I am looking for anything that people want to let go cheap (Or Free) that they might like to see restored to glory and put to good use. From one enthusiast on to another.Let us know if you have anything that fits the bill.Thank you guys!

So the time has come for another order of Tobacco.I will keep it to 200grams to try and avoid customs, which makes it hard as there are tons I would like to try but I don't know what gambles to take.I won't get an aromatic this time as I am more invested in English's or VA's, I wouldn't mind a good VaPer.Unless someone can suggest a super amazing aromatic that still has a creamy tobacco flavor. I will stick to tins as well.I am considering picking from the following.Escudo,Royal Yacht,Balkan Flake,McC Samovar,Aperitif,Black XX,There are scores more to chose from though, especially from McC who I have had great blends from.Any game changers you guys and gals can suggest?

After asking on /r/pipetobacco if anyone would be interested in an Aussie subreddit, I decided to go and make one for those who were interested.This is not intended to replace /r/pipetobacco in any way, in fact I hope to direct new members to that wonderful sub to take advantage of their wealth of knowledge and awesome archive of info and FAQ's, as well as their Sidebar links for new smokers.The intent for this sub is to give us all a lace to hang out and keep in touch, as we are a minority among the members on PipeTobacco. Hopefully we can organise some trades or sales amongst ourselves here as well.I am happy to take suggestions on how to set up and tun this sub, and will hopefully be sorting it out properly over the next few days/weeks to resemble something a little more professional.

I have only recently started with snus but I have been pipe smoking daily for about a year, use nasal snuff daily, and often dip\chew as well.I have just got 4 tins in the mail, 2x Thunder Extra strong which I believe is 16mg, Telemark Xtra Fresh which is 20mg, and Thunder Ultra at 22mg.I have had many pipe tobaccos that heavily relax and sometimes disorient me (I like it strong) strong snuffs give me a great buzz, and most dip, usually Grizzly and Cope, give me a sweet buzz and a fair bit of euphoria when I pack a big lip.I'm finding the Snus seems to not deliver for me, as I type this I have 2 Telemark pouches in, and still only a very light buzz, the Thunder Xtra does nothing with a single pouch.My friends get rocked by it pretty hard, the usual sweats and light headedness newcomers can experience.Is it just me, that I have a strong tolerance that is more pronounced with pouches than loose cut, or snuff and pipes?I'm at a bit of a loss, I though this snus would rock me pretty hard, which I like, maybe it just isn't supposes to work that way?It's all fresh and not expired too.Any help would be great, cheers everyone :)

Hi guys.I am sorry knowing this subject pops up often, but I am planning on buying my first Artisan pipe in a few weeks, It is my 28th B'day, and fathers day here in Australia a few days apart, and also I am 'celebrating' my seperation from the Army and returning home after 7 years, so I want to spoil myself. I am looking to spend up to around $400 USD, but could MAYBE splurge a tiny bit more if it means jumping up a few rungs in quality.Keeping in mind if a 'lower-mid range' pipe can be had from a reputable seller for a bit less that's awesome, as I love saving money as much as the next guy, even when I have permission from SWMBO.Can you more knowledgeable guys throw me a few suggestions?

This is what I want the new megas to be: 6.)ZU-F**KING-BAT!!!Nope Crobat can totally go to hell. Zubat would WRECK your team. Remember the Hoen region? With the caves filled with Zubat? Exactly. It won't even need a stone,they will be found in the wild already mega evolved. 5.) Three words: Dunsparce, Ancient, Power.4.) Spoink deserves love, Spoink always gets overlooked by his evolution Grumpig. But what if he got a mega? What people don't understand is that Spoink bounces and Grumpig sucks. Give it a mega and more tails, and it will BOUNCE. ON. EVERYTHING. Your home, your pokemon, your bag, your rival, you name it.3.) Burmy is a miracle, he born and out of nowhere somehow CREATES A COCOON! WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?! You know what? F**k Wormadam and it's B**ch *ss ears. The lovable Burmy is the one who needs the Mega.2.) Garbodor, you may not know this but Garbodor MAKES new kinds of poison gases and liquids inside their bodies. THIS CREATES AN INCREDIBLE BREAKTHROUGH FOR ASSASSINATION AND MURDERS! Just give it a mega and BOOM, more trash, more poison, and more destruction.1.) The true pokemon God, my love, my only, Bidoof. Bidoof is the most HATED pokemon (from what I hear). What did this lovable rodent ever do to you? BUT if he were given a mega, the entire Metagame would be destroyed. They'd have to create a new Tier from the power of Mega Bidoof. It would have Huge Power and it would be able to learn extremespeed plus swords dance. With stats of:Hp150/Atk180/Def150/Sp.Atk150/Sp.Def150/Speed150 Sorry guys but this is what they deserve, and what we need.

Then, I start messaging her recently and she starts texting but doesn't reply. I wait a couple hours and send her a text, she replays again and after I send a text, she doesn't respond for the whole day. I'm not sure what it means exactly, but I don't know how to approach it. I know she's probably busy but she's usually not so it feels as if she might be ignoring me. Anyone know how I can approach this?

32nit7	-21187	1429074673	teenagers	[Advice] [Serious]I think I ruined a relationship (Long)	[Serious]tl;dr at the bottom. My best friend has liked this girl for a really long time and I've always had feelings that they were meant for each other. But the thing is, I also used to have a crush on her (I asked, she said no. But we're friends now.) It was just a gut feeling that they were meant to be together. I remember he told her about his feelings but she didn't reject him nor did she didn't like him. But a week later something changed. I was in my room using my phone and whatnot when a blue flame like light started forming un the middle of my room. I didn't know what it was but me being curious, I stayed. But the light started forming a vortex around me and that's when I realized it wasn't just a light, it was some sort of energy that pressed against me and somehow carried me off the ground. The light/ energy abruptly ended and dropped me. That's when I realized my room was different. Not messy in that sense, but a lot of was rearranged quite neatly. I called out to my mom then she yelled at me telling me to get ready for school, which was weird because I just got out of school, and said that she didn't want to be late for her job. That confused me a bit since she was currently attending those colleges that are only 9 months long and she was still in school. I put aside all that bugged me and just got my backpack and went to school. The car ride there was normal. But it's not until I arrived to school when I made the sudden realization. I headed towards my 10th grade humanities class when my teacher told me that it wasn't my class. (He's also my advisor so we're close.) He basically told me not to be late to a 11th grade's teacher's class. That was when I realized I was in the future. I asked for the date and it was April 7th 2016. I won't get into much detail on what went on (unless you ask me) so I'll just say the essential. I went out to lunch still totally crazed from this incident when I saw my best friend and his crush, making out. I went up to them asking how long they've been dating and they said for a about a year now. They looked at me weird like I was supposed to know this and told me their anniversary was April 3rd 2015. The day they both went to Conji. All that happened and I as stuck in 2016 for a month until I was confronted by the one who sent me there. All he told me was that he was capable of great achievement and that I was as well. Soon after that, sent me back to my time. I was still blown away from my experience and me being the stupid guy I was, I told my best friend. He of course didn't believe me, no one did. So I created a "joke" that's I travelled into the future so people would believe me but didn't. Anyways, spring break started and I was stoked to see my best friend dating the girl he was supposed to as I had seen. But when the day came, it didn't. They remained friends, and only friends. I started thinking that maybe it would be delayed a day or two but they only remained friends. I started thinking to myself that perhaps I was the reason they didn't end up with each other. Now I have this guilt inside me that I ruined what should have happened and only I was able to see his happiness. He doesn't believe me but it doesn't matter and as more time goes by, it seems like his chances just get smaller and smaller. How do I cope with this guilt if I have no way to deal with it? If you're wondering on what happened to my second self, what I seemed to believe was that I merged bodies with my future self. Like my conscience only traveled foward. It would be helpful if someone could help me try to fix this relationship that should've been. **tl;dr** My friend likes this girl. I went to the future. They are a couple. I come back, weeks pass, they are not a couple. Help.

Anyways, recently for the past few days, I've been feeling guilty more than ever. Now my friend and the girl are not only a couple, but starting to drift apart from being friends. It makes it worse now to see that now they can't at least be friends. But that's not the only reason I posted today. Starting the past Week, I began having visions/ flashbacks to that visit. Before any of you start to question that they were just memories, it felt to real to be a simple memory. Almost as if I was watching it straight from a television. It keeps repeating almost every other other of each day and I don't know what it's trying to tell me. The vision/ flashback that constantly repeats itself is the day they hooked up. The day of April 3rd, 2015 which was Conji. As I have said before, I didn't go to Conji so I don't know what it's trying to tell me. It's as if I've been there before but I haven't. The way the vision/flashback starts is that I am arriving there wearing my Great Saiyaman cosplay outfit with my friend. Anyways, it goes pretty normal for the most part. We just look around and meet several voice actors. Then we see his crush and he leaves me to be with her, which I seem to be totally fine with, and I am left alone. I walk around alone and next thing you know I see them both holding hands. This is where it ends. Now I'm not sure what this means because this NEVER happened. If anyone could help me out understand and how to tell my friend, it would be great. **tl;dr** My friend and the girl are drifting apart as friends. I had visions/ flashbacks of a past that never happened. Help.

35c5j8	-21187	1431122825	teenagers	[Advice] [Serious] I think I messed up a relationship (UPDATE 2)	Previous posts: https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/32nit7/advice_seriousi_think_i_ruined_a_relationship_long/                     https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/333tkk/advice_serious_i_think_i_messed_up_a_relationship/          TL;DR At the bottomI'd like to first say that I am NOT under any kind of medication nor do I need help. I took the suggestions and visited my doctor. I am as healthy advice have ever been, mentally and physically. Anyways, on to what happened. These past weeks ever since my first visit to the future have been VERY different from what I saw happen. I think my going to the future changed the timeline. After the girl my best friend liked told him that she didn't have the same feelings for him, I knew I messed up what was meant to be. This may seem unimportant at the moment but during that time I got a girlfriend. Later, I came under the impression that another friend of mine shared the same feelings as my best friend. I talked to the girl to see what she truly felt, and told me that she didn't see a a relationship with either of them. Now originally, she dated my best friend but that changed ever since I had my trip to the future. I had an idea to mess with the guys that liked the girl (there were multiple) and I knew I was close enough with the girl to pull this off. I told her that we should come up with a plan to pretend as if we're dating. My girlfriend was really sweet about the plan and didn't think much of it. So we do the first phase, which was to sit together, have my arm around her, pretend to make her laugh, all the couple things. Of course they got jealous and quite sad for my girlfriend (they had no idea she was in on it) and I speculated that they were going to take revenge on me. The girl saw that one of them was about to cry or became really sad about it so she told me she couldn't go on. Eventually we tell them, my best friend was a pal about it but many other friend was still sad/mad. Keep in mind that the prank happened just yesterday. Anyways, I arrive home and do my usual stuff, take a nap, play Morrowind, and listen to music. I'm about to go to sleep and right when I enter the room , the same light/flame from before appears. I pass out for about a minute and when I wake up, I see that I'm not at the same house that I'm at right now. I look around, and come to the impression that it's my new home. Pretty much everything was the same except for the fact that I lived someplace new. My mom tells me to get in the car to go to school. I do everything as I did before, and ask around. I was a bit more experienced so I go to my Junior class. I look I'm in class but didn't really pay attention because I knew that I didn't need to know for now since it's not my present timeline. It's lunch time and I go visit my girlfriend when I'm told by her friends that not only does she not go to the same school, but that we're not a couple anymore. That devastated me because I now knew we wouldn't last forever. I look for my best friend and he's not with the girl he likes. In fact the girl was single as well. She came up to me and started talking to me, which I found odd since she didn't talk to me that often. I push her aside (figuratively) and talk to my friends. That's when I noticed that we weren't as close as we used to be. We still talked, but we didn't talk like we do now. The day passes and I find myself with the same man that I met when first traveled. I asked him, "What is the point of this?!" He responds with a raspy voice, "You must know that you control your own path." He moves his arms in a sort of pattern and creates a light/flame. I pass out once again, and I see myself back where I was. I was really shocked and decided to sleep on it. What do you think this means? I know that the man told me that I choose my own path, but what about the others. I've told them but they don't believe anything I say. How do I help them and how can I prevent this? **TL;DR** Girl doesn't like best friend. Other friend likes her. I have girlfriend. We prank the guys. I go to the future. Everything is changed and different. Help.

I haven't been only playing Oblivion so it's provably about one month of game time in total. I'm at level 35, and am an imperial. But that's besides the point. I recently enchanted my armour to have %90 Chameleon and a day after that, I soon got bored since I didn't have the exhilaration of almost dying and surviving. I continued to play, I raised the difficulty, and it seemed to bring it back. For a while at least. Then I got bored again. I decided to get new armour to get rid of it, but by then it had been to late since my skills had gone dependent of the chameleon. What do you think I should do?

3hy8xy	-21187	1440233403	Screenwriting	[FEEDBACK] Numbers (Sci-fi, 19 pgs)	Greetings /r/screenwriting! This is the first script that I have ever written on my own. It still very much still in its rough draft fork. Prior to writing it, I hadn't been very interested in film or anything in that genre besides watching it. I am not a professional in any way. It is just a hobby at the moment, but I believe with enough dedication, I will be able to be one of the best. As I said, it's a hobby, most because I'm still in high school. I tried my best with the formatting, but these are my questions for critique. What is the tone of the story? Does it flow well? If not, what felt forced? Are there any inconsistencies? Do the characters seem alive? What detail should be added? If there is anything else that you have to say outside of these questions, please let me know! I accept all sorts of helpful feedback, whether it's harsh or nice, as long as it is helpful. This script was inspired by this Reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2ns30z/wp_you_are_a_teenager_with_the_ability_to_measure                                                       This is my **Logline**, I tried my best. A Teenage boy in the ninth grade, gets severely hurt. After recovering, he starts seeing strange numbers. What could be the source of this strangeness?                https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1GC5X8yYyaCWXZDWXVMU2xPeGZ1RDRjUzJhNlJDNjlCTVRB/view?usp=docslist_api                       **Edit**: I forgot to say that this would be written in the way of a television show. Which means the main character won't solve everything in this script.

248lbf	-21198	1398734173	Advice	Need some advice.. with this girl.	About 2-3 months ago, my friend broke up with his girlfriend. He was fine, but she was unstable. She had been broken, twice, by the same guy and it was apparent to tell that she needed someone to be by her side since that was the main problem with her last relationship; the lack of support, in her words. Anyways I began to speak to her everyday, for as long as she needed. I wanted more than anything to see her become happy again. After a few months, she did and we continued to talk, but on a much different level, a little more intimate. Eventually we concluded that we were attracted to each other, but she just kept saying that we wouldn't do anything because I was such close friends with her ex.I ended up talking to her ex to make sure it was okay with him before I didn't anything with her, since his friendship meant more to me than potentially beefing over a girl. He gave me the green light and eventually her and I started like making out and stuff like that. She ended up catching feelings and asked me what I felt about her, I denied and said that I didn't have strong feelings for her.Then she started fucking with other dudes, which is okay I guess but a bit unsettling. Two of them happen to be friends I've had for 5+ years. I'm not worried about either of them honestly, but I feel like she doesn't feel like she has before, and because of this, I want her more than I did before.How should I approach this with her? Should I even bring it up? Idk, I've been stressed about it for a while and I needed to tell somebody &amp; I don't trust anyone to keep their mouths shut, so I'm bringing this to you guys. Please help

2921tg	-21198	1403704204	offmychest	I want you in my life, but...	I hooked up with my friend's ex-girlfriend a few months ago, after he said it was okay. It obviously wasn't.His ex is a very spiteful person, and tried using our one time together to try and spite him. He confronted me, and I answered truthfully and apologized. I also told him that I wouldn't do anything with her again.Well he leaves for basic training in less than a week, and she admitted to me that she has really strong feelings for me. I'd be lying if I said I didn't have feelings for her &amp; if I want to, I could honestly do what I want to with her the minute he passes through the gate. That's one of my best friends though, I can't betray his trust like that. I really want her in my life the way she was again, but things are much to complicated to act on impulse feelings.I love you, but I can't have you.

2ax2pb	-21198	1405564137	offmychest	Girlsssssssssss	I’m just gonna come to terms with this.I like, well pretty much love this girl. I can’t stop thinking about her. she’s been around for me since the 8th grade. She’s easily one of my best friends…She recently moved to another town like 15 minutes away, but still does a lot of her business in our town. She just took a trip down to the Dominican Republic for her sister’s wedding. one of the people on that guest list happens to be her boyfriend of 2 years. one that’s cheated, lied, and deceived her more than once.She’s done nothing to deserve that.There are very few girls that I've felt strongly for, but none of those feelings equate to the ones I have for this girl. I just want to see her happy, and idk, I think I can provide that for her. She does so much to make sure I’m okay, and I will always return the favor whenever I’m available. She’s such a beautiful person inside and out. She’s amazing, I try so hard to impress her &amp; I don’t even know if I’ve accomplished that.I just appreciate her so much. I wish I had accepted these feelings much earlier. Maybe we could’ve been something.I just cant get her out of my head. I miss her and I wanna see her already. She’s so good, I want her to myself.I was scrolling and saw her. She’s so beautiful; her smile, her hair, her eyes. She’s just so… so enticing, I can’t deal.I want our minds to connect on an extra terrestrial level. I want our bodies to intertwine as I enter her thighs. I wanna wrap her up tightly as we lay in bed together and just call her mine.But I can’t.

I met with my advisor earlier this morning to talk to her about how classes are going, and what courses I should take for the next semester. Upon talking to her, I made mention of the fact that I took the ECE Stats course in High School &amp; passed. I am eligible to receive the extra credits, however with the grade I received in High School, it would set me at a 2.3 GPA before the end of this semester. I'm almost positive that I can bring my GPA up based on my current grades, but would it be better to retake the Statistics course?

Please help me point out my weak links and what I can do to improve my monk.With the addition of my new crafted gloves with high-resists, I am now officially above the recommended MP10 benchmarks. After reaching paragon 100 and hitting these numbers, I am now looking for a new goal. I'd love to get everyone's opinion on where you think I should go from here. Two paths I can think of are continuing with OWE and moving up DPS, and dropping OWE. However, I am not limited to these two choices and would love to hear what you guys have to say. My exact budget is difficult to determine because I like to play the game patiently, and am willingly to hold off on AH purchases until I see a truly good deal. (That plus a load of items I haven't gotten around to selling). When did the price of rare weapons skyrocket? (Or did they?)I am aware that the most recent patch of 1.0.8 brought inflation, but its affect on weapons seems unusually high. I bought my current mainhand two months after the patch for 55m, and I believe that upgrades around 150m back then cost around 300m now for that of the same caliber, but I could be mistaken. To give a sense of what kind of money I am working with, here is a breakdown of my current gear:- Shoulders: Crafted- Amulet: Crafted- Gloves: Crafted- Bracers: Crafted- Inna's Radiance: 30m- Tal Rasha's Relentless Pursuit: 90m- The Witching Hour: 67m- Inna's Temperance: 6m- Rare Ring: 4.5m- Natalya's Reflection: 250m- Natalya's Bloody Footprints: Self-found- Rare Sword: 55m- Won Khim Lau: 100m**Total:** 602.5m (gems excluded)Fun fact: In my career as a physical resist OWE monk, the only item that this resist seems to cost more on is the Tal Rasha's top and socketed rare rings without mainstat (though significantly less-so).

Because of this, I've been researching as much as possible, and keep finding "obedience training is a must".  Totally get the logic here and I have every intention to do this.  My only problem is I have no interest in paying someone else to do it and going to a class.  I live in a large metro area with lots of parks, so the socialization won't be an issue.  I just feel like in the age of the internet, there should be no reason that I can't obtain the right information and do the obedience training myself.  Does anyone have good resources or tips to recommend? Anyone think I'm horribly naive and ignorant and am in for a rude awakening :) ? Would love to hear people's thoughts!

20u76v	-21220	1395258243	greatdanes	Puppy Problems	I'll preface this post by saying Sophie is only 8 weeks old.  It's possible this is a normal phase, but given how rapidly a Great Dane grows, I want to make sure that any behavioral issues are taken care of yesterday.  Sophie is sweet and cuddly for much of the day, but when she isn't, watch out world.  She is not motivated by treats or any of her toys, so basic training has been tough.  Her attitude seems to be "yeah I want that, but if you don't give it to me now I'll go find something else."  If she is chewing on something, or someone for that matter, I'll calmly redirect her and offer her a toy instead.  This only strengthens her resolve and she will increase her effort to destroy that thing ten-fold until I have to restrain her whole body and hold her muzzle.  I don't want to crush her spirit and I want to train positively, but she is making it very difficult.  Any advice to deal with a puppy who tries to assert her will with her teeth?

She still whines a little bit when she puts weight on it, and is still limping although the limp has lessened slightly.  This was only about 15 minutes ago.  I really don't want to bring her to the emergency vet, and would like to wait until Monday if possible.  Has anyone experienced anything like this?  Could it worsen if I did wait?

hw9oj	-21231	1307699684	electronic_cigarette	E-cig economics - Battery cost 	A personal vaporizer (e-cigarette) investment must include recurring costs, mainly atomizers or cartomizers, and batteries.  For the purposes of this, I'm going to presume 900mAh as the norm for daily use.  Li-Ion batteries tend to be limited to 300 recharge cycles.  To avoid boring reading this is the summery of battery cost of respective units* Supermini l88/306 ~ $10/month + in cost* Mini 510 / KR808D ~ $4.80-$5/month + in cost* Riva 510 eGo style ~ $2.75/month including in cost* E-power ego / NoEgo 1050 mAh ~ $2.14/month for 700 days, 52c/month each additional including the in cost.     Ease of use, style, and other factors trump raw cost of operation.  Supermini PVs such as the [Blu](www.blucigs.com), [Envy](www.envycig.com), [Joye 306](http://www.joyetech.com/ProductsView.Asp?id=57), or other L88 represent the high end of the scale.  Representing typical 90mAh, a typical user would enjoy 10 recharge cycles per day, thus needing 10 per 300 days.  At $10/per this is $10/month, or $100/300days.  This doesn't include entry cost.Next up are the standard Minis [510s](http://ecigwiki.info/index.php?title=510) and KR808D-1s, slightly larger than a traditional cig.  Both represent a base option of 180mAh, with 240/280mAh being optional, or slightly more expensive 380mAh batteries.  The base price on these is ~$10/per or ~$15per for 280mAh, thus needing 5/day for 300 days @ 280mAh 3.21/day, $5/month, or best case $4.80.  This doesn't include entry cost.Now for the eGo style, closer to a cigar than a cigarette in size.  These range from 650mAh, to 900mAh, to 1100mAh.  The best deal on the net is [Liberty Flights](http://www.liberty-flights.com/product.asp?id=55#p1) at $33 shipped for a light kit, being just $1.52 cheaper than a pair of batteries.  From the get go, this is $2.75/month without needing to replace batteries for 500 days.  Last, we'll look at units that use 14500 (900mAh)/14650 (1050mah) batteries, also in the eGo style.  This includes the [NoeGo](http://www.jazzcartopipe.com/#!14500--no-ego), and the e-power eGo style @ $48.98 shipped  The NoeGo is $32 but doesn't include batteries, which a charger and batteries will run at least $20 for ultra fire protected batteries, and $12/pair shipped.  So the middle ground at $50 represents $2.14/month for 700 days before considering another $12, 52c/month.  It'll take 15 months to hit the break even point vs the Riva 510, 37 days shy of the estimated end of life of the Riva 510 batteries.

byv3j	-21235	1272751383	AskReddit	Music lovers?	Personally, I feel like I listen to music a lot differently then most people. I feel like I actually hear the music and feel it. It is very difficult for me to find a song that I can't at least respect, even if I don't like it (which almost never happens). Music is a major part of my life. It's really difficult for me to explain exactly what i mean, but I hope I am not alone in this. Does any one else feel this way?

3g6l3s	-21238	1438986689	latin	Latin Books	I'm looking to choose a text book to use as a teacher. My best experience has been with the old version of Jenney's. Not the 1990 edition, I mean the one before that. I was shown the Cambridge Course and feel like there are serious deficiencies in it and am trying to find a better alternative. I'm willing to supplement but, with the Cambridge Latin Course, my fear is that I'll end up using the text to supplement my own material. Does anyone have any suggestions for texts that still do a good job of covering the grammar and not just teaching students how to get the gist of what they read? I've used Henle before as well and found it too convoluted and the old Jenney's, my top choice,  is out of print as far as I can tell.

You are basically turning the business into a monarchy, instead of hiring qualified, poor applicants. Seriously, why don't you try interviewing people first? Oh, right, that would require you to give a shit.&gt;It's no surprise you're seeing lots of Filipinas in Mcd's and Tim Hortons.Yeah, it is actually, as discussed previously&gt;They're not TFW's, but permanent residents.TFW? What does that even mean? Shut up and hire some good workers instead of these "Fiilipinas" you keep in Tim Hortons. Seriously.&gt;Very clearly management likes what they see, so they continue their hiring practices.SURPRISE. That's not a surprise, it's bad business. What the hell are they doing with their company?&gt;Why would it be any different 15 or so years after I left the scene?Holy piss-balls. **Now** you tell us you are unqualified? What the fuck?&gt;I'm absolutely convinced that r/Canadians are by and large oblivious to the reality that Generation Y is not exactly known for their amazing work ethic in low skill / low wage jobs.Thanks hun. You go back to not being manager after 15 years and tell me how it works out, asshole.&gt;I'm also am convinced that they do not understand that business owners and managers appreciate good old fashioned work ethic.No, **you** don't understand work ethic.I'm done with this.

He was complaining about back pain and our instructor asked him the usual "what's your birthday?" questions and stabilized his spine. Ended up having to get him a helicopter to take him to the hospital. The EMTs told us we did the right thing and that he could have severed his spine if we let him walk. So just a friendly reminder to let you guys know to rule out any back/neck injury before you let anyone walk if it's a serious wreck.

1h6hr2	-21272	1372343815	NeutralPolitics	Those of you who believe Snowden should be jailed: do you believe Mordechai Vanunu was a spy or a whistleblower?	[Mordechai Vanunu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordechai_Vanunu) was an israeli who revealed details of the Israeli nuclear program. I have always thought of Vanunu as a whistleblower and one that did not deserve going to jail for telling the world about Israel's "secret" program. But by that line of logic, shouldn't also Snowden be seen as a whistleblower?*Some background:*In true NeutralPolitics spirit, I think the Snowden/NSA case has more than one side. An argument against considering Snowden as a "hero", is that he broke democratically formed laws. Laws that might be (in my personal opinion, at least) stupid, yes, but nevertheless US law. And in a Democracy, citizens have to respect the laws and rather change them through the democratic process than to just ignore them.I know that many disagree with that interpretation of US law, or probably feel that the Patriot Act did not get the attention it deserves in the press. **Those are not the points I want to discuss with Snowden fans/critics**, so please focus discussion on the similarities/differences between the cases of Vanunu and Snowden :)

I can understand crying at your own wedding, as it's supposed to be a once in a lifetime thing, but I'm talking about people crying at other people's weddings.It would make sense to cry if you empathized *a lot* with the bride/groom, but I've seen people cry even if the bride or groom doesn't cry, or even when they don't really know the couple at all.* The Big Decision to live together for the rest of their lives was actually taken when the proposal was accepted* I live in a western secular country where nothing substantial changes after the wedding; the couple probably lived together and had sex before the wedding* It's not like anyone believes the promise is actually irreversible, at least in the weddings I've attended (ironically, two or all of the couple's parents were divorced in all but one wedding!)* The formal process (paperwork) is usually done before or after the ceremony itself* I realize the actual promise to God is usually made when marrying in a church ceremony, but I haven't noticed that crying at weddings is limited to the very religiousI will probably marry someday as there are many reasons to marry, both emotional (the promise to your SO) and rational (taxwise, in the event of one party passing away etc). But I still don't get how someone elses wedding ceremony could make anyone cry - please help me understand!

[This Japanese webshop](http://postalco.net/products/90066/) sells  reversible belts with the buckle and the holes in the belt hidden by the other end of the belt. The design made its way around the web last year ([example](http://gearhungry.com/2014/05/reversible-post-buckle-belt.html)). They temporarily went out of stock, and based on heavy use of google translate during the order process, it seems that they only ship to Japanese customers. The store won't return my e-mails.The design is fairly simple and it would be weird if no one had copied them yet, but my google-Fu is failing me and I haven't found a single alternative supplier. So, has anyone else seen this design elsewhere in cyberspace?

Due to a breakup and a little medical crisis (since resolved), I feel like I need to do something different for a while. I have a modest but stable income from a small business that needs almost no attention (an Internet connection every 2-4 weeks would be enough). I want to use this freedom to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I have some ideas, mostly involving travel, but I want to hear your ideas on how to suck the marrow out of life.I'm not good at woodworking.

AMA	After a few times posting and being badgered into doing one of these, here I am and here's some background.6 years ago I was prescribed a couple medications to deal with my social anxiety disorder.  One of them was Paxil and this predated the 'black box' warnings that are now in place to warn doctors not to prescribe said medication to patients going through puberty.  The medication had horribly ill effects (looking back all they needed to prescribe me was the Xanax and I would have been just fine).  Within the week I had carved words into my chest, floored it down a wooded hill slalom style in my Volvo, and eventually jumped off a parking garage, down 60-80 feet onto the street below.  Had 14 surgeries, developed an opiate addiction, quit that and learned to slowly walk again. My body slowly continues to regenerate (nerves regenerate between 1-2mm a day and I'm 6'5"  :\  )  and I'm beginning to get back into the swing of trying physical activities, with my current endeavor being to relearn how to skateboard.  So yea, AMA.Edit:  Here's the best I could muster for now, sorry the images are so bad but I was taking them standing up and xrays aren't the easiest to photograph, but give a crip a break. I made it work :)  [Xrays](http://imgur.com/a/SQxGx)   [Scars](http://imgur.com/a/vwbcS)Edit: I'm back, I'll take any questions just bear with my typing.

1n0hlw	-21289	1380000216	needadvice	Reddit, can you please help me? [x-post from /r/AskReddit]	So last year, I made a friend, and to keep things anonymous, let's just say his name is Danny. So Danny and I (as lame and dumb as it sounds) met over Xbox live through a friend who went to our school. All 3 of us went to the same school, but me and Danny hadn't met prior to my other friend introducing me. We would always play Halo: Reach together and kick ass at Team Swat. Eventually we started hanging out, and I took him to my church. He was a really cool guy, and I really enjoyed hanging out with him. He really liked my church, because he could tell that the people there actually felt like they accepted him, which they did. He and I eventually became very close to each other and would tell each other everything. We were accountability partners. He struggled with a lot of depression, self harm, and self loathing. I always tried to help him with his problems in any way that I could, but it was always very hard to do.So yeah, he was a great guy and everything, but he struggled with self harm and depression, so it sometimes made things hard to deal with for both of us. His parents were almost never home, because they both had to work a lot to make decent pay. His dad worked at a gas station, and had to work many hours. His mom was a chef and also had to work many hours. This left him home alone a lot, and eventually made him very anxious.He would always come to me for consolation and I would go to him for consolation. But over time, for some reason (I honestly had no idea why), he began to start acting very *strange*. By this, I mean that he progressively became manipulative towards me.Because of him becoming more and more manipulative to me, it made me trust him a little bit less. This being said, I stopped telling him everything. When he would find out that I hadn't told him something (which I hadn't told anyone else either), he would become irritated with me, and mad at me. Eventually this got so bad to the point where he would literally *scream* at me when he would find out that I hadn't told him *literally everything* about a situation I was in.This progressively got *even worse*. He would tell me that he was going to run away from home, and I (thankfully) talked him out of doing it. I know I should've called the police and told them about what he was going to do, but I was stupid, and didn't. So eventually, he started cussing at me (not in a friendly banter sort of way) on a regular basis, saying things like "fuck you", and other awful things about himself, saying that he's worthless. It broke my heart to hear him saying things like this about me and saying awful things about himself. I know I'm being very redundant while writing this, and I'm sorry about that, but I'm really stressed and probably not going to revise this.So recently, he's come out of the closet (which I don't have a problem with, but it was just a shock to me, because it was so unexpected). After a while, it seemed like he was deliberately trying to follow the stereotypes of gay teenagers. He wears collars now, paints his fingernails, and has "snake-bite" lip piercings and his voice has started to change to a higher pitch, and has started to talk with a stereotypical "gay voice". (God, as I'm reading this, I feel awful, because there's no way that I can think of to say this without sounding like a bigot. I really don't mean to and have absolutely no problem with homosexuals, I just really don't know how to state this, so please and I cannot stress this enough, *please* do not write any comments calling me a homophobe or a bigot.) obviously all of this is his choice and I completely understand, but he's now starting to act like a completely different person. Now it seems like he's seeking attention from people by acting flamboyant.My theory is that for so many years of being neglected and ignored by his own parents, he is now seeking attention from other people. I hope he's not doing so. It would really suck if he was trying to do this for attention. I want him to be him for himself, not do it for attention. I still love the guy as a friend, but I've just lost a lot of trust in him after everything that's happened.tl;dr My ex-best friend became manipulative and mean and is now acting mean. I don't know how to deal with it and wanted to get it out of my system.Any helpful comments are appreciated.Thank you

She had late-stage Alzheimer's and recently she hadn't been eating and was unable to communicate. My dad and I are on a plane right now, flying out to her state right now to attend the funeral. It's kind of a shitty situation, but at least she's rid of that horrible disease. It really takes a toll on the whole family (especially my father who practically handled everything financially with her and was taking most of the responsibility of her treatment at a hospice).So yeah. It was pretty hard to deal with at first, but I'm gonna be fine. I'm just glad she's in a better place now. Whether or not heaven exists, I do believe she's in a better place, be it infinite nothingness or heaven itself. RIP.

My right shoulder hit the turf and the back right side of my head whiplashed and smacked the ground pretty hard. I saw stars and my friends ran over to see if I was okay.I never lost consciousness. I answered all my friend's questions ("What's your name? What day is it? When is New Years? Who am I?"), never lost consciousness, wasn't dizzy or disoriented, had good balance, didn't have any nausea or vomiting, and had no excessive fatigue or blurred vision. I am worried because it has been 21 hours and I still have a headache. It feels like there is pressure in the back of my head and on my temples. I looked up all the symptoms of concussions, and the only one I have is a headache. I have no extra sensitivity to light or sounds.So is it possible that I have a concussion, even though I don't have any other symptoms? Or is this most likely a bruise that's creating pressure headaches?Thank you so much in advance for any help. If necessary I'll see my doctor asap.
2v0ee3	-21342	1423248501	atheism	I posted this in response to people on my Facebook feed bashing Obama's speech...	One of the best ways to combat extremism on a social level is to support and accept those who condemn the extremists acting in their religion and allow them to push for more "modern" versions of their faith. If society continues to marginalize and discriminate against Muslims, it pushes more of them to the fringes of society and creates an environment that is more conducive to extremist ideology. Anybody will try anything if they are in a desperate enough situation. Look at Nazi Germany, for example. So accepting people who are advocating for a more progressive version of their faith, even if it's not your faith, is a simple way to help turn the tide.Which brings me to the President's remarks on Christianity, for which I've seen a lot of backlash. News flash: what he said is true. Christian extremists did and do exist. Millions of people have been killed in the name of Christ throughout history, and discrimination from Christians does continue to this day.The most common complaint I've seen is, "That was a long time ago. Get over it." Or, "Why bash the Christians when this is a Muslim issue." Yes, IS is currently an extremist Muslim issue. But extremism in all it's forms is still a problem today. One of the beauties of knowing history is that it allows to accept where you've come from, understand the shortcomings of the past, and work towards creating a better future. You literally cannot create a better future if you do not understand where you are starting from and WHY you are there.And to answer the argument, "That was a long time ago", yes organized Christian wars for the holy land were fought in their majority awhile back. But it is irresponsible and flat out wrong to say that Christian extremism doesn't exist or that fundamentalists don't discriminate against others. Abortion clinics get bombed. Laws discriminating against homosexuals try to get passed. Kids are forced into Jesus Camps which tell them of all the sin they commit and that they will suffer for eternity because of it (which I think is a form of child abuse, to be honest). American Christians have created an unfortunately successful movement in Uganda to institute the death penalty for homosexuals. And people are saying the Christian's shouldn't be lectured on extremism?Yes, this is a minority of the people, which is a good thing. Once again, we must accept and encourage those who have a progressive version of their faith regardless of whether you believe it or not (and if you couldn't tell by now, I do not). But any time a situation arises that runs parallel to our past or even our present to some extent, we must take the opportunity to reflect. We must reflect on where we were and why we acted in those ways. We must reflect on the state of our society, country, or faith and think about the shortcomings, why we're here, and how we can change it.Denying that there is a problem just because some other group has a more pertinent issue is irresponsible and ignorant. Just because we're dealing with one major issue shouldn't mean that we don't reflect on others at the same time.Extremism, in all its forms, is at the forefront of the news right now. It's a Muslim problem, a Christian problem, a Jewish problem, a Buddhist problem, a Hindu problem, an atheist problem, a liberal problem, a conservative problem, and even a PETA problem. Ignoring your own "groups" issues because another's are a bigger deal does nothing to advance society.Oh, and get your kids vaccinated. Seriously, this is getting ridiculous.TL;DR Every group has extremists. Acknowledge it or be doomed to repeat the problems.DISCLAIMER: Yes, I referred to extremism as an "atheist" problem as well. Before I get lambasted for that, here is my thinking:1. I wanted to quell all the "Hey stop talking about ignoring your personal group's problems if you're not going to even reference your own" comments that I would get, which would overshadow the whole argumentand 2. No, I don't know of any "extremist" atheists bombing places or murdering religious people. But I do know a bunch who I think go a little too far in terms of bashing others, not accepting religious people, and needlessly trying to pick debates/fights with everyone. Again, small faction, not very "extreme". Just tried to cover my arse from others with the reference here.

2twg0f	-21370	1422402341	musictheory	I love music and want more than anything to major in it at university. There's just one problem: I Can't Read Music.	Hello all,I'm sure some of us have found or are finding ourselves in this very same situation. I've been playing my instrument (guitar) for 10 years now and I take it very seriously and practice my scales/theory daily. But for some reason getting over a sort of hump to get into reading music never happened to me. However, over the years instead of forcing myself to read music, I just started training my ears to be able to play songs without reading them. A lot of the best American music (jazz, rock, blues) came from musicians who had the same problem as me, but they were still considered great because they were known for their attuned ears, improvisational/rhythmic prowess, and they wrote genuinely good music from scratch without writing any of it down. So I practiced, and practiced, and practiced. Finally the day came. I was off to college and had my heart completely set on being a music theorist or musicologist or composer. Just someone who analyzes and understands chords and scales and can write music on paper. I was never one for "pop" music and I always thought that I could offer a lot to the professional music world. I think about music/theory everyday. I have a drive towards it that I felt I needed to follow or I would regret it the rest of my life. I listened to all the greats from Sybil of the Rhine to Led Zeppelin. Studying, listening, refining my craft. I thought I was ready for auditions, but not being able to read was obviously a big concern. Every door I went to at my local university's music program was slammed in my face. It was demoralizing. It was as if they were telling me that I was incapable of being a musician. "How absurd" they must have thought. "a musician who can't read music." I supposed I had deluded myself into thinking that anyone was capable of making music. In my eyes they were telling a bird not to sing. Furthermore, as I had planned on being in the music program, I had also booked a room in the performing arts dorm so I lived amongst all of the people who were doing exactly what I wanted to do. But I noticed a stark difference between they and I: **They Had No Passion For Music.** That's what really got to me. A whole dorm floor of music robots just following orders; reading what was on the page, but never truly interpreting it or "feeling" it. Many of them were horrified at the pure thought of having to improvise in class. Some people have said that I should just start recording my own material and try to get famous. But that isn't the goal for me. For me, holding a bonefide Collegiate Music Degree would be a dream come true.This brings me to the root of a couple topics to discuss and the reason I'm posting today.* Do you think there is an inherent problem with academic music when some caliber of musicians are excluded?* Is this bias some how justified?* What might you suggest other readers do in this situation if they want to pursue a career in professional/collegiate music?     * Producers/Music 'Engineers'?     * Composers?     * Freelance/Commercial Composers?* Do 'non-reading' music programs exist? Are there related musical degrees that don't require one to be able to read?Thank You For Listening To My Story /r/musictheory! And a big thank you very much in advance. I look forward to reading your responses.Edit: Thank you so much for all of your marvelous responses.Addendum to my situation from a comment below:"I suppose for me the hardest thing has been following the rhythms and recognizing notes in the blink of an eye. I know all of the notes of both staves and can read it when it's placed in front of me where i can analyze it's structure (my favorite thing to do). I'm interested in building chords and melodies that flow easily and correctly and analyzing the music itself, but the ability to sight read or even hum melodies from a written page has always proved especially challenging."But from what I've read below my instrument can be rather difficult for most folks to sight read on, but it's just a skill i need to hone more while also appreciating the time I've put into my aural training.

3f2pi1	-21370	1438202086	fivenightsatfreddys	My theory as to what will be in the box..	After you beat night 9 on 10/31/15 when the DLC comes out the box will open to reveal... A teaser trailer for The FNAF Movie! The reason Scott put a "?" on THE END teaser on scottgames is because the series isn't ending at 4. With the movie coming out soon this could mean that the movie will pose even more questions to the story. Hopefully this isn't the case and the movie will finally tie all of the mysterious loose ends off with a nice bow.
3j42x3	-21370	1441044459	fivenightsatfreddys	We Need A Professional	Any criminal investigators out there willing to help us solve this ultimate mystery? So many varying opinions it's hard to pinpoint facts and evidence from hearsay any more. We need someone on this case. A professional. Just for fun? Every Phone Guy call, every map, every suspect (animatronics included) We need to have an investigative lockdown just like the investigators from FNAF 2 when they started investigating the murders. No one (or thing) gets out. Every spoken word, picture, map and canonical vantage point of the crimes (as depicted in the minigames) must be looked over with a fine comb of scrutiny. No stone unturned. Starting this evening I will begin compiling all of the evidence as we know it into a word document for everyone to look over (will post link in comments below once completed). Transcripts of phone calls, in game maps, storyline as told from the minigames (minigame maps), newspaper clippings, drawings. Everything in order from FNAF 1 onward in order as they were presented to us (timeline is temporarily irrelevant until all exhibits have been scoured over). Wish me luck. Any transcriptions and screen captures of maps/ minigames would be very helpful. LETS DO THIS.

She says "yeah ill watch your beer" as i take 2 steps away I say " I dont really care about the beer, I was just hoping youd still be here when I get back." She did one of those surprised quick audible inhales... I didnt look back. I get back from smoking and she moved to the chair next to me. I sit down and she puts her hand on my leg immediately. Conversation turned sexual quickly. She has my room key, shes coming up, she stopped at her room obviously to freshen up before it goes down.Tl;dr one line gets sex

Well over 100 and I don't count. Sex is fine to me. Im not at all curious as to my SO number or whatever.  Why does reddit seem like this is such an important conversation to have. My girl could tell me 1 or 1000 and I wouldn't realistically care, but I dont even want to know. Maybe its because I wouldn't want to give my number out in fear of her freaking, but I dont understand why this would be "an important part of couples relationships" knowing eachothers past. The present is the best indicator or wants and needs and communication (about your needs, not past) is above anything else in my mind.

Apparently what happened is i failed to respond to a piece of mail that was sent to my house by the state requesting that I provide proof of insurance on my vehicle. This put my in violation of ILCS 6-204. I was then pulled over, told I needed to post 3000 dollar bond for operating a vehicle with a suspended license plate. The cop allowed me to sign a document that states i will show up to court instead of posting the 3 grand. I cleared up the violation by showing proof of insurance at the DMV and they told me my license plate is now clear. My question is, what else should I be concerned about at court?  The cop said i should bring my license reinstatement,  but thats all he offered me.

A couple of cops were walking around the other side of the walkway towards me. As they approached, one cop looked at me, then i saw his facial expression change. As he walked a little closer he said, "Hey, what are you smoking?"I said, "its just a cigarette man."The cop sternly replied, "looks like a joint to me. Hand that over" as he was still walking towards me.I calmly replied, "I bet the first joint ever smoked looked like a cigarette."I flipped the handrolled cig around to show him a filter rolled into it. He just looked at it, contemplated my thought, kinda shrugged a little and they both walked off.

26de21	-21403	1400934387	teenagers	[Advice] How to get over a break up	Last night, my boyfriend broke up with me. He said how he hadn't felt the same about me for a few weeks. That he tried to save it (he didn't, I did. His friends even recognized this), but it just  didn't work out.Quite obviously, I'm very distressed about this. I tried my best to save it, and it ended up blaming myself for what had occurred. I ended up sending a message to him that basically said "I want to be friends, but it hate you right now. You lied to me, and played me. Fuck you."I just want to know some tips as to how to get over this. Thank you.
26gnre	-21403	1401043884	teenagers	[Other] Update on break up	Some of you may have seen I posted yesterday, asking for alive to get over a guy. Thank you to those who read it, and posted on it. Every bit helped.Yesterday, I ended up going out and watching a movie with a friend. We watched Men in Black, and played on the Wii a bit (I kicked his ass in Wii Sports Resort)I then went home for dinner, then went out to see my mutual friends with my ex. We ended up having a fire, which was great. We talked about the break up (they essentially hate him, as he's pushing them away, and also due to how he treated me) played music, danced around, laughed. It was an overall amazing time. I ended up going off to the side a bit, so cry (was emotional as some songs reminded me of him). I was then told go get up and dance, and when that didn't work, I was given scotch (hated it, burned my throat) and ice cream. After I was done my ice cream, we ran around in the streets (no cars) to walk 3 people home. I got back to my friends place, got picked up, and went home. It was excellent.I've realized that all of our mutual friends are willing to stand by me. They're willing to put forth the effort to be my friends. Today, my best friend ended up facetiming me for a good 2 hours to cheer me up and hear me rant. It was great.

2ynfjo	-21403	1426052768	raisedbynarcissists	My Mom May Have Stolen My Mail...	So, first off I'd like to give the obligatory "long time lurker, first time poster" for this sub reddit. I'd also like to say that I'm not sure if this is really narcissistic behaviour or not... My mom is a  good mother(usually, but she has her issues) but I'm just really paranoid right now due to some things she's done. But this seemed to fit here. If the mods have an issue with it, I'll gladly delete it.Also, due to being on mobile, there may be errors.Anyway, on with the story. This will be kind of long.Backstory:Ever since I was little, my mom always took any mail that I got (birthday cards mostly) and opened them. I wasn't allowed to. I'm not sure why, but I didn't argue with it since I didn't want to be yelled at. As I grew older, she would "accidentally" open up my mail. Usually a bank statement telling me how broke I was (we were with the same bank, and my name and my dad's both start with an A... easy mistake if you aren't looking)I put up with this for most of my life. Until just before I turned 16. For my early 16th birthday, I was lucky enough to be given an iPad (I had no phone and still don't, or a computer of my own). I was ecstatic. I let my mother use it while I was in treatment for some mental illness issues, which I've since recovered from, and would notice that she would try to read through my messages and emails...Every time, like clock work, if I ever left my iPad unattended and unlocked, she would open up all of my social media and emails. She'd go through them all. She would literally read every single message. I learned very quickly to keep my iPad on me at all times, and to have a password (two now, because of it being jail broken). Eventually, I got a (ex)boyfriend. And I was at his house and decided to not bring my iPad. As a nice gesture, he sent me an "I love you!" message while I was with him at his house. That way, I'd be happy he thought to say it. About an hour later, he tells me about this and said it was read. I was shocked, and very upset about this. Once I got home, I ended up yelling at my mother for it. Her excuse for looking through all my social media, and reading private messages between my (ex)boyfriend and I? She wanted to know what's going in in my life. Because she's worried I may go back to my previous mental illnesses. I called bullshit and stormed to my room, very mad.I ended up asking a trusted teacher (more so a friend now) what to do. And he just said to keep it with me at all time. Which I do now.Present:I now have a new boyfriend, who decided to send me a letter for valentines day. It was super sweet of him to do so, and I was so excited when I got it. We decided to open our letters together, which won't be until the summer due to distance. So, knowing how my mother is, I hid my letter in my room. Now, a couple weeks later, I can't find it. I know where I put it, and I'm afraid that she has it. Due to her going through my mail and social media, I can't trust her with things like this.This letter was super personal from what my boyfriend told me. It explains why he loves me, in great detail. I'm waiting until the morning to check her room and see if she has it.I just really hope she doesn't have it and I'm just an idiot who misplaced it. I think I'll explode at her having it if she does, even if it's unopened. It's a huge invasion of my privacy, and she's done this for so long. It isn't acceptable.Sorry for the rant, I'm just so upset by this. I guess I just want my feelings to be validated, since obviously they haven't been validated with my mom in the past.TL;DR - my mom may have stolen a personal letter from my boyfriend to myself. She has a history of going through my mail/messages. I'm currently super paranoid about it.

3eqgz4	-21403	1437970669	teenagers	[rant] I've been basically cut out of a movie marathon because I have a boyfriend.	I first mentioned a movie marathon to my friends about a year ago. We decided to do it in the summer, hopefully when everyone is less busy. We also decided upon a LOTR/hobbit marathon, so that it would be super long. Now. My one friend has been organizing it, which I'm thankful for because I have work and can't do it myself. But he just messaged me telling me that if it's after August 19th, I'm basically not welcome to come because that's when my boyfriend is returning from Europe. Said friend can't stand couples apparently?? Even though a couple will be at the marathon.... I don't really get it but it's so annoying. I was seriously looking forward to the marathon....I'm just really mad and hurt by this.

I'm not talking about a demo like most people are doing now that comes like a month before the game. This needs to be a real Beta test, and it IMO needs to be large enough to get some real data. They obviously have a playable demo, so why not let the public test it? The fact is most of the in-house testing misses loads of things that to most games is obvious. Almost every beta I've ever been a part of the first time I played it was asking myself who da fuq tested this? The developers are "play testing" the game, but they are doing so in how they feel the game should be played and what they "feel" is balanced. The only real way to tell if its balanced or overpowered is extensive public testing. I recently played the BF:Hardline beta (demo) and was asking my self how did they not see that the M16A3 is overpowered?I like most of you are probably really sick of the crap that's been releasing in the FPS genre. I get it that its all about sales and this is why most games of late have been catered to the "casual" gamer, but casual isn't always fun...even to the casual gamer. You have to look no further than Medal of Honor 2010 and then Medal of Honor Warfighter.So please don't fail us, and have a "real" beta test early enough to do something before you make a bomb

So I thought ok no big deal we'll just get him next pass, but same thing my rockets were not landing on target. DICE had to have done something to the speed of the Zuni because after several games I found that I have to lead alot more than I did before the patch.

Now opinions will very on what went wrong with this game I feel it was Visceral trying to appeal to casual CoD kids. We've already seen some CoD elements in Siege and many die hard fans want their removal, and I agree that some of these super casual aids like X-ray vision need to go I understand Ubi dilemma. What Ubi needs to understand is you're never going to make everyone happy, but if you try and appeal to another group just to get some people you'll end up alienating both groups. You add loads of CoD elements the CoD kids won't like it because its not CoD enough, and Rainbow fans wont like it because its too CoD. I'd love to see Ubi stick to the Rainbow roots and make the best possible game not some hybrid game to drawn in hypothetical sales numbers because if you do....this game is dead before it even arrives.

The beta is going to be accessible on all platforms, and this is a double edged sword seeing on how console players will have access. I really hope Ubi keeps listening to this community then, and doesn't give in to the inevitable wave of CoD casual console players. Now I'm saying all this from a console players prospective (I have a PC but most of the time I play on console) consoles are over due a good tactical shooter. My last hope is the Beta isn't like two weeks before release I really want Ubi to have enough time to make this game "right" on release, and not "close" after several patches months after release.

So all the BF4 players that want in the program can have a friend thats in send and invite;however, not everyone that gets an invite will get in....some people will never get in.Now you have some people that are already in, and my have played BF4 in the past but really aren't very active. Honestly do you really want to waste time with these people? Why not let the people that really want to get in...get in? Honestly how many people that play on Xbox that are still active in BF4 really want a code? It can't be that many so why not guarantee they get in? From what [tiggr](https://www.reddit.com/user/tiggr) said: &gt;There is an upper limit (much like we had on PC) - which we will extendJust because you are in the preview program and play BF4 doesn't guarantee you get in....

The server is [Heatseeker Heroes](http://i.imgur.com/f9w2p2G.jpg) Also I think that playing Vanilla maps would be best, so that way anyone who wants to play can play. From the response its probably best we play Conquest Large because even if only half of the upvotes join it's gonna be to large for other game types. Please get on Battlelog and change your Tags to [rXB1](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/profile/edit/edit-soldiers/) this way you can squad up if you want with someone from /r/xboxone/ hope to see all of you.
3d0c8w	-21408	1436704696	xboxone	Reminder: /r/xboxn@e BF4 play date is today @ 12pm EST	Again the server is [Heatseeker Hero](http://i.imgur.com/f9w2p2G.jpg) for anyone that wants to join. Also 12pm is just the start time, so if this is to early for some of you...no worries join when you can . Now if for some reason the server is empty at the start time join (if 10+ people could join at start time it will fill up fast) anyway it will fill up. One last thing if for some reason the server crashes...wait about a min then join again.Hope to see you on the Battlefield

1v0uex	-21412	1389520365	Bitcoin	Average user and bitcoin security?	Realistically we can't expect an "average" bitcoin user to learn a brand new operating system (Linux/Ubuntu) and master the process of installing it from a live cd. To then go onto the somewhat but not overly confusing process of creating a paper wallet in said brand new foreign operating system. And  it has to be said, having the trust in a website that it has not been hacked so that it will create a secure paper wallet. Is there anything available now or in the pipeline that will allow a user to nearly perfectly secure their bitcoins from a windows/mac o/s? Even if it is only cold storage (for now).This to me is probably the most crucial area for development in the bitcoin space. And it may not even be insurmountable with the way our current operating systems function, but I guess a hardware solution could overcome that?

1yhavd	-21412	1392934660	Bitcoin	Removing Mt Gox is not censorship	It seems to me that somewhere along the line people here have forgotten the role they play in this current experiment called bitcoin. I like most users here believe bitcoin should be non-regulated or lightly regulated at best. This leaves a situation therefore whereby the community would be required to step up and do the regulating. Logically this means that crucial issues such as which exchanges are safe for users to use should be moderated by the current users of bitcoin to the best of their ability. This means we as participants should be demanding that Mt Gox  should be removed from charting sites and pricing sites equally and without a second thought of is this censorship? I say we have an obligation to new users to bitcoin to show them which places are safe(r) to use, and one of the best ways to do this is limit exposure of Mt Gox the exchange to as many people as possible.

240ovx	-21412	1398500219	Bitcoin	This is why we need a serious discussion about changing to a smaller unit for bitcoin	I feel this community is a missing a big opportunity to further drive bitcoin adoption. Published in this [article](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/04/25/ozy-bitcoin-africa-currency/8148853/) today is the following statement:&gt;Which makes bitcoin super-appealing, if you can get past the expensive exchange rate — as of publication, one bitcoin was worth nearly US$500. This is just one example, but when you couple this with the ridiculous amount of [sub units](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Units) bitcoin has, it's far to confusing for non-bitcoiners. Heck, looking at that wiki list of bitcoin sub units above, even I'm confused. This community, being one of the largest in the bitcoin space, almost has a responsibility to at least seriously discuss changing the default unit for bitcoin and how we could possibly implement this. Because realistically this can't be enforced; but if this sub-reddit, the core developers and majority of exchanges are on board, well that's a start. 
2abafh	-21412	1404974576	Bitcoin	Wallet or webpage to monitor paper wallets	Need an application that will allow me to put in several paper wallets (watching only) and monitor the total amount of bitcoins in my account. I usually use Armory, however I can't seem to add paper wallets to the wallets I already have on Armory. It will only allow watching only addresses that were backed up from an offline Armory installation (digital files). Either a website were I can put the public keys in or an application (I use Ubuntu), to see the total amount of bitcoins, thanks. Also I do realise that blockchain can do this, but I want it all on one page, as I do have 10+ addresses to monitor.

2be6l7	-21419	1406036757	hearthstone	Need some advice	im fast approaching enough dust to make a legendary and im wondering which one too make. i have leeroy ysera tirion and jaraxxus already. is there any others which would help me out a lot or are useful in all decksas a side note i like playing warlock and druid if that affects which card to make next. i would also be interested in playing warrior but looking at most good warrior decks they have a lot of expensive cards.Or as an alternative would it be better to craft a few other cards like 3/4 epics or something
2cox1i	-21419	1407249763	hearthstone	does anyone else get an awful amount of hate from this game	so im not some amazing player at this game, i play a bit of ranked now and then but im nothing special. recently i got enough dust/the right cards to build a really decent deck imo. i packed a lord jaraxxus very early so i thought i would concentrate on playing warlock, then recently i got a lot of the more expensive cards needed to make a handlock deck. since then i have a lot of grief from people after game saying that i need to learn to play without money and stop spending hundreds of pounds/euros on this game and how people like me are ruining this game. now these people dont really get to me that much, i just brush aside the comments and delete them as soon as, but im just wondering does everyone else get this sort of hate. im a huge fan of this game i dont want to see its community turn into one of hatred and anger all the time like a lot of other popular games have. i put up with a lot of grief from people when i play league of legends but when someone has a go at me for being lucky in a card game heavily based on rng and luck i just dont get it, how can you be angry at someone for something they have next to no control over. idk really, im not trying to seem like some whiny little kid but i just want this game and it players to be as great as possible, i enjoy playing it but i dont want it to turn into another one of those games where as much as it is fun, the people on it just make it impossible to enjoy it.
2dgbku	-21419	1407949583	hearthstone	[SPOILER] I just got BM'd by one of the naxx bosses...	so there i was in a pretty bad spot i went all out but miscalculated my damage (was one mana off lethal) so i passed the turn over to grobbulus. he send his first minion into my freezing trap, hits me with a slime to put me at two health, summons a leper gnome and uses his hero power to kill it and kill me with the deathrattle. he had four minions he could run in to my face but no he went for this play...In case you didn't know his hero power is deal 1 damage to all minions.
2f39hj	-21419	1409501184	leagueoflegends	small bug with available champions	has anyone noticed or anyone else had a bug where champions have the free week icon on the portrait even though they aren't on the free week. for instance atm i have an icon on gnar even though he isnt on the free week ( i do own gnar but it still shouldnt be there) and also all the normal 10 free champsby no means is this game breaking, but just wanted to bring attention to it, whether its with all champs or just gnar, in future it may provide some annoyance. http://gyazo.com/17d580c82df10fbcf4f30b06e55d71cf  this is a pic to show what i mean, gnars portrait has the little icon on it like all the free week champs (vayne is also in the week for the tenth champ but couldnt fit her on aswell)
2ir5fa	-21419	1412858474	leagueoflegends	Hackers advertising via friendrequests?	So i got a friend request when i logged on today but i didnt recognise the name. I accepted anyway thinking it might have been someone from a previous game or whatnot.Anyway i got a message from them as soon as they logged on advertising some sort of coaching/boostbuying. I dont know what it is but obviously it all seems quite dodgy. I [screenshotted](http://gyazo.com/b623d8e85f04b66dc9501d0382cc3e19) quickly and then they logged off. Also the account level was lvl420 and in master tier but with no games won shown.i have hidden the name for now incase its against some rule but obvs if someone sees this and needs the name i can provide that easy.just wanted to get this out there incase anyone gets scammed or something from this.Also sorry if the title is a bit odd or misleading, i just didnt really know what to title it as :P

2lextx	-21419	1415227799	CallOfDuty	Need some help with identifying features of weapon variants	I was wondering if anyone could help me out with what some of the symbols mean on weapon variants. I understand the -/+ attributes fine but occasionally on some of the more rarer ones you get other icons. I've only managed to figure out one so far on one of the elite ak variants which doesn't allow any attachments. Does anyone have a video or article or anything explaining what all the other icons mean?
1xmxz6	-21422	1392146609	MakeupAddiction	Help me decide what to buy with my MAC gift card!	Hi there! This is my first post, so go easy on me!I received a £30 (about $50) Mac gift card for my birthday, and I'm spoilt for choice for what to buy with it.I already own a good concealer and foundation, I only really wear dark lips and I have those bases covered too. I have a couple of urban decay palettes that cover most of my shadow needs, and I have Touche Eclat for highlighting.I was thinking either something I can use to contour (because I currently use 5 year old bronzer which is no good really) or a primer/utility product. However I'm swamped with the website and I'd appreciate some advice.I have NC15 skin, prone to mild acne around my chin and cheeks. I can get greasy around my nose, but also get dry patches where I use particular products to keep my spots in check. Picture [here](https://24.media.tumblr.com/2a475457c1bbfedbe8e7e6218590f66c/tumblr_n0srx2UySB1qjzfjmo1_500.jpg)Am I missing a holy grail product? Is there anything that stands out to you that I could benefit from? Is there anything that is well worth getting high quality?Thanks so much :) I look forward to reading replies!

1zgc2p	-21422	1393871945	KillLaKill	What to watch post-Kill La Kill?	Hi!I'm quite new to anime, I started with Shingeki No Kyojin, then watched Evangelion (original and Rebuild) and more recently I've been following Kill La Kill. To say I love it is an understatement! I enjoyed the storylines in the other two, but I'm a big fan of the humour and fast-pace of Kill La Kill.Could anyone recommend me some more animes that will help on the comedown after this season finishes? Mostly light hearted please, SnK manga is killing me as it is.Bonus question: roughly how long will it take for there to be a second season of KLK?Any and all answers very much appreciated :)

211g49	-21422	1395446894	KillLaKill	(SPOILERS) Am I the only one who thinks there's too much to wrap up in one final episode?	A couple of people have told me that it's unlikely for there to be a second season of KLK, which at first surprised me because it was just so good! However, after thinking about it, I can see why that's the general consensus. TTGL only had one run, and it seems to be the fashion for high paced, kick-ass anime to burn brightly and then go out in flames.But I just can't see this whole thing wrapping up in the 22 minutes of episode 24. There's so much we don't know (what's Ragyo gonna do with no original life fibre? What's she gonna do with Shinra Koketsu?) I'm worried it's not gonna tie up properly. It's been the best show hands down, and I'm so pleased I got to follow the releases as they happened with such a great community, but if it doesn't end right the whole thing could be ruined.What is the general opinion on this? Can you see it all being wrapped up happily in one more episode, and would another season kill the pace?

I don't get on well with the [brush](http://www.makeherup.com/wp-content/uploads/clubbing.jpg) types, and I'm hopeless with gel.Your personal recommendations, swatches and reviews would be very appreciated! I'm also in the UK, so if the brand is sold here it's a bonus. My budget is ~£15 ($25).Thanks &lt;3

If someone in the US would be willing to ship their own that they haven't used much, or even grab me a new one and ship it, I'd be very happy to pay for the costs! Either that, or I'll go grab a UK-only product you'd like of similar value, and we can swap :)

I'd love someone to write to, who could write to me in English, and/or simple Japanese.I'm still very much a beginner so someone who speaks some English would be great.I love animals, especially cats, and I play guitar and sing in a rock band full time.

2gz2h1	-21422	1411241221	DesignMyRoom	Please help me find a room divider to fit my awkward new bedroom!	Hi!I'll soon be moving to a house where my room is on the top floor, and I'm planning on splitting the room into two sections: a sleep/relaxing part and a living/study area. The room has two natural sections, and I desperately want to separate them with a divider. I was planning on an oriental style screen, but the ceiling is [bizarre](http://i.imgur.com/eRxREJS.jpg) (I'm planning on separating the room just before the little step) and I'm pretty sure that's not going to work. Please help me come up with ideas to divide the room! I want the sleeping section to be almost completely private (the mattress will be on the floor in the section near the doors you see). Bonus points for oriental style objects, as I have some oriental art about the place.

2nxye6	-21422	1417445183	SkincareAddictionUK	Routine questions, + any experience with Eucerin's DermoPURIFIER range?	Hi all,I have combination acne-prone skin, for which I use the Neutrogena Visibly Clear cleanser, and while it's helping with redness and blackheads, I'm having an influx of dry skin.I've been using the Sebamed Clear Face gel as moisturiser, and while it's fine on my cheeks, forehead and nose, around my chin (where most of the acne is) it's falling short. It's hormonal acne, and I think the dry skin is actually causing some of the smaller spots.I tried using NipFabs Glycolic Cleanser, but it broke me out in places I NEVER get breakouts, so I came to the conclusion that it just wasn't a good fit.Is this an exfoliating problem, or a moisturising problem? I've been using FadeOut day cream with lactic acid, in the hope that it would have some kind of AHA effect, but it hasn't! I've ordered some of the Stridex Max Strength pads, but they have yet to arrive.I was thinking of using the Eucerin DermoPurifier moisturiser, has anyone had any experience with it?Thanks in advance! (PS. I hope this is ok to post, that there isn't some giant thread it should have gone in instead!)
2pw146	-21422	1419088476	MakeUpAddictionUK	Would anyone be interested in buying a brand new Vice 3 palette?	I added it to my amazon wishlist, then my mum bought it for me when we were out shopping, to put under the tree. Little did I know another family member bought it for me off of the wishlist before I could take it off!I'd like £40 plus £3 for shipping, but I understand it's pretty close to Christmas, so if you're in an area around North West London or Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, or Buckinghamshire I might be able to deliver it to you (I commute from Hillingdon to Dunstable)I can provide a picture of the palette if you need, it's never been touched, in its little pouch and box.Please comment any questions!

It's not available online anywhere except Australia with incredibly expensive postage, so I was hoping someone here might be able to help me out :) it has to be this one specifically, as it's for a friend in hospital who loves bright colours and sea creatures.Preferably new or very lightly used, however I'll consider anything I can clean up.Please please post if you have anything!
2wogdi	-21422	1424544643	JapanTravel	Am I underplanning my 10 day trip?	Hi!My partner and I have booked to visit Japan in December, and it's the first time for both of us. We're staying at Citadines Shinjuku. I have basic knowledge of the language (about JLPT 4) and have done a LOT of research into our trip, but I feel like I might be underplanning our stay.He and I are both just out of our teens, and love city life, coming from London. A lot of what I'm looking at makes me feel I want to stay mostly in Tokyo, with only two days trips to Yokohama and Kamakura. Is it silly to go for 10 days and stay mostly in the same area? I weighed up the option of a JR Pass but it just seems unnecessary for our plans: just exploring the city. I'm interested in the sort of oddball stuff, but it seems like most of the online guides are angled more toward older tourists and I'm having trouble finding an opinion I can trust.We're both very busy in our careers at home, and quite like the idea of exploring on the metro, going to Disneysea, and finding tasty food at our own pace and without lots of train journeys. Would you call this a waste of a trip? And if not, please recommend your unusual places of interest for two frazzled musicians.
3cez5q	-21422	1436269583	JapanTravel	Vaping in Japan	Hi all!My boyfriend and I are spending 9 days in Japan at the end of October, and I wanted to know a little bit about the attitudes to e-cigarettes. I know some public places allow regular smoking, but should we be prepared for confusion and possible problems with an electronic one? Another thing I'm concerned about is legality for the unit and e-liquid: we won't be breaking any laws by taking them into the country I hope.It's not one of the ones that looks like a normal cigarette either, it's a chunky box battery with a liquid tank so probably won't go unnoticed!Also, any special Halloween recommendations would be very well received: we'll be in Tokyo.Thanks again :)
3cob97	-21422	1436449141	TalesFromRetail	"I'll have you know I passed A-Level Maths!"	First post! I work at a popular clothing store in the UK: we sell mostly ladies wear, but have some kids and mens too.So it's past closing time, and we're just finishing serving the remaining customers in the queue. I should note, I'm new so haven't been trained for the till yet, I was just tidying in the area. The last lady is making a big return and exchange (of course) and her two small children are spinning around the empty shop messing up the displays and rummaging through the big product bins near the till.My colleague finishes her exchange and she starts making her way towards the half closed shutters. I give my manager the nod, signalling that this lady is the last in the store and she can close the shutters once she's out, when Return Lady (RL) stops in her tracks, staring with a confused expression at her mile-long receipt. She turns on her heel and marches back to the desk, tiny kids still crashing around behind her.RL: Excuse me, I think you've made a mistake with my return!Colleague: I'm sorry if that's the case madam, what seems to be the problem?RL: These items were in a 3 for 2 deal, but I only got £X back for the exchange! You're trying to make money on returns!C: I see madam, but you understand that you only paid for 2 of these items because of the 3 for 2, so you only get what you paid back when you return?RL: Don't try to pull one over on me! I did A-Level Maths, I think I know what I'm talking about!C: *politely and repeatedly explains until she gets the message* (at this point, it's 30 minutes past closing and we're behind on our tidying and rail clearing)RL: Well, why didn't you make that clear before? It's a simple explanation! Come on girls, we have to go and pick up the food from **Grocery Chain**.I didn't feel like telling her that since she wasted so much time being finicky about her receipt and waited until last thing to make a big return, she'd missed out on collecting her food because they'd just closed! Also, I'm pretty sure one of the kids wet themselves while she was arguing :/

In my schools bible studies program we had to fill out a journal like thing to keep our thoughts in. In this book I described the entire process of praying to be albeit spiritually uplifting completely insane and a waste of time. The teacher reaction was to rush home and prepare a whole entire presentation about people who aren't seeing the "signs" from god and how a student (while saying this eyes not leaving me) had been "disrespectful" in their journal that was supposed to be a private matter. The class knew it was me as I am one of the classes most vocal atheists.TL;DR: Teacher shared an answer that was supposed to be private completely trashing what she had said about it being private in front of my whole class.

Well, we began to tour the small college and looked around and whatnot. Well, we stumbled upon a few of John's friends. They were sitting in three chairs. We began talking about me and everything. They introduced themselves as "Jacob, Russ, and Donald". One of them happened to be African American and his nickname was "Sloth" because he is a lazy ass. After a few more minutes of chatting, I was going to call back their names. I said "Okay... Jacob, Russ, and... Slave?" The second it fell off my tongue I immediately knew I had fucked up instantly. He gave me a weird look and he smiled and laughed. I began to panic and everyone laughed. We just promptly walked away.tl;dr: Sloth, not Slave. I love black people.

11nkx9	-21442	1350512129	Pokemonexchange	Pokemon Exchange Rules.	First off I would like to introduce myself. I am Mod Xbett, I and a few other Mods will be enforcing the rules here. In the past have noticed things are a little unorganized but I am here to change that. I would like to see the community grow and continue growing. This will bring everyone more people to trade with and also provide a large variety of Pokemon product to choose from. So here a few rules by which this subreddit will running on. These will all be enforced by the r/pokemonexchange mods.Rules1: Always use tags for you posts. If a tag is not properly used we will remove the thread and send you a notice. The notice will tell you your thread has been removed and why. Feel free to repost the thread with the proper tag.(((Here is a list of tags and descriptions on what the tags should be used for.)))1: *[H] You’re selling something. List next to the tag what you will be selling.2: *[W] You’re requesting something. List next to the tag what you are looking for.3: *[PC] You’re asking how much something is worth. For example if you have a Pokemon tin and you would like to sell it but you don’t know how much to ask. Make a [PRICING] thread that way users can advise you on how much it’s worth.4: *[PKMNThanks] This tag is to be used if you would like to thank someone for something you received in a giveaway, trade, purchase, ect…. It’s simply a way of thanking someone publicly.5: *[VIRTUAL] You are trading/selling a virtual item. This can be for trading Pokemon or items from all the games. Make sure to list the generations of the games they are from.6: *[TALK] This tag is to be used for anything in general. Pokemon related or Pokemon Exchange related.If you have any questions about the tags please ask, any mod would be happy to answer.The “SAFE” flair.  If you see someone with this flair that means they are a "proven" safe person to trade with, and that they have completed one or more trades with other members of this subreddit. You can apply for the safe flair by contacting a mod and proving that you have completed at least ONE successful trade. You must have the buyer/seller backing you up.The “ SCAM flair”There is also a SCAM Flair. This will be placed on users who have been caught scamming or attempting to scam. If you ever catch someone scamming you please provide proof and the mods will look over it. If it is substantial we will either ban the person or give them a SCAM flair.SCAMMINGThis is a very serious topic. Scamming is NOT tolerated here. If you are caught scamming or attempting to scam someone you will be banned or tagged with our scam flair. We have the ability to track anyone caught scamming so please don’t try. If you are being scammed please contact a mod and tell them who it is and provide proof. We want to be able to serve you and make this subreddit a great place for everyone but we will need proof to ban someone.If you provide enough proof to press charges on the scammer Kdude900 will find out who they are and try to get any money you may have lost back. He will also file reports about each scammer and let everyone know who they are.* **Important Notices**If you ever seen a thread with the title. [Important Notice] read it. These will be threads giving you info on a known scammer or on upcoming changes to the subreddit.Mod Posts[MOD POST]These are posts by the mods of Pokemonexchange. They may be free giveaways, events, or updates on important notices ect…. Please don’t ignore them. Event posts will always be under mod posts. DramaPlease refrain from starting drama. Its unnecessary on a trading and selling subreddit and just creates unnecessary situations. We love your feedback, questions, and comments. Just don't start problems without a reason. And if a mod asks you to stop please do so. If you see someone creating drama please report it to the mods.[H]&amp;[W] postings* 1: It must have the proper tag* 2: It must have a detailed description listing the condition of the item and what the item is. (This includes if a GBA game is fake or real.)* 3: We suggest you add pictures but If you have no way to provide them we won't remove your post. But we also warn buyer to be careful about buying something without seeing it.* 4: You are responsible for the package until it reaches the buyer. This includes if the item is damaged. Tracking and Insurance is highly suggestedI will be adding on to this as time goes on. Please feel free to ask questions and leave feedback.~Xbett
11o0ak	-21442	1350525801	Pokemonexchange	   Tips on how to make successful posts on Pokémon Exchange.	   Tips on how to make successful posts on Pokémon Exchange.1: Use the proper Tag. Choose from these. [H], [W], [TRADING], [PC], [PKMNThanks], [VIRTUAL], and [Talk]*For selling posts please list the [H] first then the [W]. For requests please list [W] first then [H].*Descriptions of each are on the sidebar or under the rules page. http://www.reddit.com/r/Pokemonexchange/comments/11nkx9/pokemon_exchange_rules/2: Next to the Tag put the name of the item you want to trade or sell. Here is an example...“[SELLING] 10 Holo Foil Pokémon Cards Base Set” This will let everyone know what you have up for sale. The same thing goes for [W] posts. Put the tag, then the name of the item you want to request.3: Always have a detailed description of your item. Including what it is, hat  condition it is in ect…. Buyers love people who are honest and tell you exactly what your getting.4: If you're selling always post pictures of what you have up for sale. This will tell the buyers your genuine and you actually have the product you are trying to sell. Mods will be checking to see if the posts have pictures. 5: Be consistent and answer questions potential buyers and sellers may have. Don’t make a post then check it a few days later. Keep checking to see if anyone is interested.6: If you make a deal with someone and you have to ship something, include tracking and insurance. Well this is optional, it is HIGHLY recommended. You are responsible for the item until it reaches the buyer. So if it doesn’t turn up or turns up broken this could save you from being flagged as a scammer or even banned. If you can show us a tracking number we will know you actually sent the package.7: Always talk nicely to the people you may be doing business with.  This is common sense. People who are mean and angry never get to trade with the same person twice. A lot of people like to come back to the same person over and over again if that person was pleasant and reliable. This could double even triple the amount of trades and deals you make. I will add onto this as I think of more tips. Feel free to ask questions :D ~Xbett

16j2oi	-21442	1358133804	Pokemonexchange	[Mod Post] Reference Threads!	   It has come to my attention that we are in need of a place where you guys can keep track of your sales, as well as leave feedback and recommendation. So I have created a new sub-subreddit where you can do so, without clogging The Pokemon Exchange with reference posts.**[Here is a link to it](http://www.reddit.com/r/referencethreads/)*** *How to make a reference thread?** Create a thread with **your** users name as the title.* You can use you page to keep a list of your inventory or just as a place to leave feedback.* After completing a trade or sale send the business partner a message linking them to your reference thread. The message will be asking them to leave a comment with feedback so that you can use it as proof, in the future, that you are a trustworthy person to trade with.[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Pokemonexchange/comments/16ibtp/xbett/) is an example of what the thread could look like. If you have any questions, please contact me.Thanks and I hope this will help your business,~Xbett

It was not Arthur Treachers, or Long John Silver's.  Throw some names out for me, and hopefully I'll recognize one of them!  Then I can sleep tonight!  P.S.  I think the chips were just actually fried dough -- so incredibly tasty!
1iu7s6	-21449	1374527354	Horses	Is that a bad time of year to clip a horse?	I live in N.E. United States.  A mare I know has Cushings, and is sweating in this heat because of her coat.  (Her coat is just now re-growing after losing most of it from rain rot, poor girl.) Do you think it's too late to clip her?  Will the bugs be (even a worse) problem on a just-clipped horse?
1ji27n	-21449	1375373402	dogs	How do I get through tomorrow? Having my dear dog PTS Friday morning.	She is old.  Her body is failing her.  Yet her mind is sharp; her eyes are bright. I know I'm doing the right thing.  I just don't know how to make it through tomorrow.
1jri87	-21449	1375734828	medical	I get extreme gastroenteritis lasting for 6-7 days when under extreme stress. Doc is no help. Does this happen to anyone else?	I am 57.  This just started about 7 years ago.  I end up throwing up the first day, and the next 5 or 6 days I a nauseous and cannot eat.  The first few times I had this, I did not drink any fluids either, and ended up in the hospital with dehydration.  Now I try to avert that with sipping water.  I just put my dog to sleep on Friday -- I've been sick since I made the appointment on Thursday.  I can't continue to go through life like this -- does anyone have any suggestions?  I have tried a few OTC drugs -- Zantac, etc., without success.  After all, who doesn't have stress in their life?  But I have to be able to handle it much better than this!

1kf63a	-21449	1376578293	pinkfloyd	Who is the guitar player who played with Roger Waters at the 12-12-12 concert -- he plays like he's in a trance?	After all these years, I'm becoming  Pink Floyd fan! Well, I was always a fan, but just listened to the music, that's all.  I was never interested in who did the playing, who argued with whom, etc.  But that guy playing in the 12-12-12 concert was amazing -- who is he?  Does he regularly play with Roger Waters now?  Was he part of Pink Floyd long ago?

Re-planted them, pinched off the flowers already there to encourage growth, and they never grew after that.  I have planted impatiens for years, in pots, and kept them in the same shady spot.Edit:  http://imgur.com/a/6baGWEdit2 -- in NE Ohio
1lwwyh	-21449	1378562377	motorcycles	Do motorcycles need to be "warmed up" before riding? If not, then why does my neighbor run his bike for 15 - 20 min every morning?	I'm trying to give him the benefit of the doubt -- he's a nice guy and a new neighbor.  Maybe his bike needs to run before he takes it on the road, like we used to do with old cars?  I'm not a newbie to motorcycles -- I dated a few men with bikes back in the day.  Back then, I always felt they ran and revved their bikes, before going on the road, just to piss off the neighbors.  Good times. :)I do wonder whether he realizes the racket he's making a 7:00 a.m.?!
1mccne	-21449	1379109905	Equestrian	Why, oh why is getting sufficient turn-out for our boarded horses so difficult, when we all know that the more turn-out the better?	No one can deny not only the benefits, but the necessity, of turn-out for horses -- any expert will tell you the more the better, and that 24-7 is ideal.So why does it seem to be "OK" for boarding stables to ignore or explain away this basic necessity?

Her hands are not dry. She has always used hand lotion.  Has not used anything new (i.e. soap, hand lotion, etc.)  She has Crohns and fibromyalgia.  She's on Plavix and Lyrica.  Any thoughts?

(I haven't listened to Stern since he left regular radio.)
1wzray	-21449	1391529592	law	I'm a paralegal with over 35 years of experience -- mostly with the same lawyer. Lawyer retired; I can't afford to retire. Do not think I want to go back to paralegal work -- what would work for me?	I worked for a great guy.  In addition to paralegal duties, I also was the bookkeeper, office manager, and building manager (we had our own building).  I did it all; I worked insane hours; I worked more when I got home; I rarely took vacations.  Blah blah blah.I would love to hear suggestions about how I can parlay all of my experience into something less stressful with normal hours -- but still make a decent living.  I've considered free-lancing, but what other types of companies might consider  hiring me for non-paralegal work?I want to do something different!  Thanks all!Edit 1 -- I worked almost exclusively with multidistrict litigation.

She's freaking out now, because the hospital told her this afternoon that if she still has the UTI, the surgery will be postponed.  She's afraid that since she did not take the Sulfa drug as directed, she screwed up.  (She was afraid to take the Sulfa because the directions said it might cause diarrhea, and she's deathly afraid of diarrhea.)So she took one of the sulfa drugs this afternoon, and is supposed to take one tonight.How good are her chances that the surgery will be OK to perform tomorrow morning? (i.e. that the UTI will be gone.)She is 85 years old; caucasian; 5'0".  About 100 lbs.  In excellent health otherwise. On a low-level type of blood pressure med, no other meds.  In United States.  Had hip surgery 4 years ago without any complications.Thank you!

2cixoi	-21449	1407096144	Cleveland	I just saw a wolf in the Metroparks. And not in the deep woods, either.	I was in the Ohio and Erie Canal Reservation of the Metroparks, walking my dog today at around 2:00 in the afternoon.  A wolf ran right across the concrete trail in front of us.  It was huge, grey and brown, no collar, very bushy, and weighed at least 125 lbs.So I stopped inside the building there, and asked the employees if there are any wolves in the park.  They insisted there are no wolves in Ohio, and it might have been a coyote.  I told them no way that was a coyote.  Then they said maybe it was a coyote/Shepherd mix.  Nope -- don't think so.  This was a wolf, no doubt in my mind.I think they just wanted to pat me on the head and say "there, there."  But I know what I saw.Edit #1 -- thank you all for your informative posts!  I'm assuming I saw a hybrid wolf/coyote/whatever!  It freaked me out because I have never seen a dog that big.

He "un-seized" the brakes.   He said if I don't use the parking brake, and just park it in gear, I should have no problems.  When I park, I've always done both -- put it in gear, and used the parking brake.Right now, my bill is $30.  Mechanic says if he "takes it all apart," it could run an additional $300 -- $600, depending on what he finds.Is it safe to not use the parking brake?  I don't normally park on any steep hills.Thx for reading!!Edit 1 -- thanks for your responses.  I decided to get it all fixed.

I restored to an earlier time (last Sunday).  I ran CCleaner.   None of these things fixed my problem.  Co-worker was able to remotely connect, so I know the problem is in my computer.However, today when I click on my Last Pass Button (which is showing red), I get an empty white  box.Could the CCleaner have screwed up my Last Pass?

11uqvb	-21463	1350844389	magicTCG	Couple of questions about cards that reduce mana cost....	So let's say hypothetically I have a [Goblin Electromancer](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sgrw5UX9CpY/UD-X3QxCThI/AAAAAAAAAjk/qmDOyKUx_mA/s400/Goblin+Electromancer.jpg) on the field and [Electrickery](http://images.magicmadhouse.co.uk/images/products/1348507137-95977900.jpg) &amp; [Street Spasm](http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/features/feat210_streetspasm_4563lkoj35_en.jpg) in my hand...1. Would I be allowed to cast electrickery for no mana since its mana cost is only one red? or does goblin electromancer only take away from any non specific mana cost?2. Could I cast Street Spasm for 1Red and 3(X) mana and then deal 4 damage to a target creature?
123d3j	-21463	1351206183	techsupport	Video Editing Project constantly crashing [Mac OSX, iMac]	As tech savvy as I pretend to be most times, I'm really not all that smart when it comes to some of the gizmos, doodads, and such that work together while a computer is running to make all the invisible magic work; what I'm trying to get at is I don't really know what the problem is so I'd like your help diagnosing it.So I've been working on a video project for school and am working in Final Cut Pro 7 as my editor. Because I am constantly going back and forth between classes, I have all of the video and project files that I need on an external harddrive that I guess was built using [Apricorn Upgrade Kit](http://www.amazon.com/Apricorn-EZ-UP-UNIVERSAL-Upgrade-Universal-Notebook/dp/B00009WQS1). Something I've noticed that has been happening recently is that when I'm working on it at school every now and again my project will freeze up, I'll get the oh so glorious pinwheel, and my harddrive will crash/eject itself which has managed to corrupt a few files on my harddrive that I'd rather of not had corrupted.So....What is the "big picture" problem here? Is trying to maintain a high end video project on a flash drive causing it to crash? is my drive just shitty and dying so its ejecting itself while im editing for no reason?What are some better ways I might go about doing this project data-wise? I need the files to be portable (which is why ive been using the external drive) but I simply cannot have it crashing all the time.should I just give in and get a new drive/flash drive?
1250xo	-21463	1351280061	audioengineering	Kindve new to this whole audio thing. Just curious, how did all of your setups get to where they are?	I've noticed some of the sweet and extensive setups you guys have in this and other audio subreddits and I was curious how you guys managed to get there. Obviously audio equipment isn't cheap so I imagine you had to work a shit job you don't like to save up for Ll of your stuff but what was the order you got your stuff in. As someone who would like to do some of this audio stuff recreationally I kindve want to know where to start in terms of equipment I should buy when I get the chance :)
126r4b	-21463	1351369515	VideoEditing	For silly home movies, would there be any advantage to using FCP7 over simpler iMovie?	title pretty much says it all, I have a "swashbuckled" copy of Final Cut Pro 7 at home that I hardly use (only got it because I prefer to work at home and a class I'm in requires some minor video editing) as well as  iMovie that came with my mac. For something like a simple home movie project for a relative would it be better to just work in iMovie where everything is SUPER simple with a pretty much drag and drop work flow. Or would there be advantages to editing it in Final Cut Pro 7? In terms of simple effects or features in any of your situations would you prefer the industry standard video editor (like FCP7) or the simple consumer video editor (iMovie). As far as I'm concerned its best done in iMovie but I'm an absolute vidiot so I figured I'd look for other opinions.NOTE: the home movie would just be a simple stream of video clips, pictures, and music that was shot and filmed over the course of a year (so there are quite a few files)

So I started watching adventure time about 2 weeks ago and just about EVERYONE I've ever talked too, who watches adventure time, are very aware of the interesting subplots/hiddenplots/interesting-story-pieces-that-have-totally-gone-over-my-head. Things like the origins of the land of Oo(sorry if misspelled) and the mushroom wars seem to just be common knowledge amongst my peers. At this point I've watched all of the first season like 4 times over (I got it on DVD) and have managed to watch most of (like 99% of) season 4 and the episodes I've seen so far that have hinted at anything interesting are-I remember you (that was a big one)-The episode where they reveal lady as pregnant at the end-the lich episode where they use the enchiridion to open a portalBasically what I would like to know is....WHAT ARE THESE PINNACLE EPISODES THAT MAKES ALL THIS BACKSTORY SO OBVIOUS TO EVERYONE? I managed to pick out a lot of stuff from "I remember you" but that's about it.... If you could please help a fellow fan who feels quite lost! 
131y8j	-21463	1352705666	WeAreTheMusicMakers	In a musical rut, looking for new music to learn to inspire my song writing [guitar].	As it says in the title my writing has become pretty stale recently. For the most part I listen to a lot of metalcore and progressive metal music and its starting to become apparent that the music I'm trying to write is reflecting that. I hate that my writing feels stagnant. Some of my favorite metal artists pull influences from almost every musical corner outside of metal and it really shows well in their work. So what I'm asking you great WATMMers is what are some good non-metal songs to learn on guitar. They could be classics. They could be lesser known artists but I'm looking for outside influences and songs to learn and hopefully kind've spice up my writing :)obligatory "obligatory edit: ": Holy goblin nipples thanks for all of the responses guys :D I probably won't be able to get around to a lot of these suggestions for a few weeks but when I'm excited for when I do :)

If it'd help I could find a way to send you the guitar tracks I have and you could give me pointers or some shit.

I'm asking because I tried tracking some guitars for a cover project for school and they sounded bloody awful.... * something im noticing about some of my recordings is that the guitars don't have a very definite sound to them when playing so a lot of the notes tend to run together. Is there anyway to fix that either through my playing style or recording or what have you? For something to compare that to, if you've ever heard any metalcore song or breakdown, the discrete song of each chug sound is kind've what im looking for. In my recordings those chugs would sound like one LONG note as opposed to a series of discrete short notesIf it'd help I could find a way to send you the guitar tracks I have and you could give me pointers or some shit.

13r0dz	-21463	1353823852	audioengineering	Side by side track comparison?	What I'd like to do is in a DAW (preferably logic pro 9) is create two tracks and lay two ALMOST identical audio files in those tracks respectively (File A in Track A and File B in Track B). From there, layer the tracks over each other so they play at the same time.Specifically what I want to know is, is there any button or shortcut combo that could seemlessly mute one track and unmute the other track while they are both playing so I could do side by side comparisons of the tracks? It sounds like a simple enough question but for the life of me nothing comes to mind. Any help appreciated :)

13uvsz	-21463	1353991984	audioengineering	Might be recording a live orchestra with access to limited gear.	My little sister (15 years old) is in a community orchestra in our town and she has mentioned how awful the recordings at her concerts usually are in terms of quality (they basically just prop someones phone up and record audio and video through it) and so she said her orchestra director wanted to talk with me about maybe doing a higher quality recording. If I get the chance this is something I'd very much like to do but I am pretty limited on gear...I have access to about 4 dynamic microphones, small 8 channel mixer, an audio interface, and a laptop with a DAW on it.Would this be something worth even trying? From what I've heard condenser mics are standard for orchestral events for a damn good reason and since I don't have a multi-track recorder there is very little post production work I can do on it.Would there be a noticeable loss in quality if I used dynamic mics as opposed to condensers?

I have a very nice iMac with some pretty nice specs and am in no need for a second. What would be nice would be to have something that I could take with me places (on the couch in my house, on vacation, to a friends place, to school) for some basic use such as browsing the web, writing up school assignments, listen to a little music, etc. Similar to how an iPad is just nice to casually use while you're watching tv, but without the touch screen and the restrictive OS. As well, I used to be primarily a windows OS user and now that I use MacOS now... I kind of miss that ability to find fun little projects and tweaks on the internet that I could spend an afternoon trying to get to work on my computer. Having a computer for those fun little tweak projects would be nice too.thanks in advance

Is there?I was restringing my guitar yesterday (.12-.56 gauge strings) and while tightening the lowest two strings I managed to strip and snap them both. After stringing up the other four strings I noticed that most of them produce this buzzy vibration sound whenever I strum them and it sounds like there is a loose part vibrating on the headstock or something. Needless to say this is all pretty frustrating some I'm coming to you guys with my tail between my legs to ask this embarrassing question. As someone who has been playing for four years I assumed I would've figured this out by now but for as long as I remember restringing my guitar has always been a pain so I'm just hoping someone can give me a quick link to a tutorial on some "proper" method or just explain where I might've screwed the pooch before I go back to guitar center and buy a new set.

My wardrobe consists mainly of metal/punk band tshirts, cartoon tshirts, skinny jeans, hoodies, and sneakers. Part of this comes from me working at hot topic so I get that stuff for cheap, but also because I've grown a fondness for them.

For the problem I will be referring to the tension in the horizontal string as **T^a**, the tension in the diagonal string as **T^b**, and the radius of the mass's rotation as **R**.&gt;a) Assuming, &amp;omega;, is large enough to keep both strings taut, find the force each string exerts on the ball in terms of &amp;omega;, m, g, R, and &amp;theta;.My work for this part is...&gt;T^b cos&amp;theta; - mg = 0&gt;T^b cos&amp;theta; = mg&gt;**T^b = (mg)/cos&amp;theta;**&gt;T^a + T^b sin&amp;theta; = (mv^^2 )/R&gt;&amp;omega;R = V&gt;T^a + T^b sin&amp;theta; = m&amp;omega;^2 R&gt;T^a + (mgsin&amp;theta;)/cos&amp;theta; = m&amp;omega;^2 R&gt;T^a + mgtan&amp;theta; = m&amp;omega;^2 R&gt;**T^a = m(&amp;omega;^2 R - gtan&amp;theta;)**Now the second part says...&gt;b) Find the minimum angular velocity, &amp;omega;^min for which the lower string barely remains taut.How should I be starting this problem? any help is appreciated? Should I be doing something with centripetal force?

1cs0at	-21463	1366510367	Bass	beginner re-stringing question	So I've recently come into possession of a bass guitar, I've just finished cleaning it up a little bit, and I'm getting ready to restring it. My question is, is there some special way I should go about re-stringing this if it doesn't have any strings on at all right now? I know on some past guitars I've owned if I tried to restring them from being completely empty the tension in the bridge usually caused some of them to snap when I would tighten them up.

I had been looking at the google chromebooks because they seemed like cheap little computers with enough offline apps to do the vast majority of homework and such on as well as some other things... And then I remembered "Oh wait! You're trying to be a compsci major... it's probably not a good idea to get a chromebook" (and if I'm wrong please feel free to correct me) so now I'm turning to you folk for help. Keep in mind I don't have oodles of cash at my expense.**And here's that wonderful SuggestALaptop form!****LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE** * Country of purchase: USA * Budget range: Preferably no more than 500 dollars but if that's unreasonable I suppose I can save up a bit longer and work a bit harder to get that extra buck * Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): programming, basic college coursework, and what I assume is mainstream stuff * Screen size preference: no more than 14 inches * OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): windows/linux, haven't had much luck with programming resources while running on a Mac * Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): Don't really intend on gaming with it and this is the last priority I have... but if it doesn't hurt my price point something that could run indie steam games like Braid, Super Meat Boy, The Binding of Issac, or Limbo and maybe an GameboyAdvanced Emulator would be a cool little perk * Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.): if there are any computer science students or enthusiasts out there who could lend me a hand with what I should have for this section it would be greatly appreciated. Also maybe some decent video playback for entertainment would be nice. * Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support): not sure. Probably self support * Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, businesscompatibility): none. * Any particular style that you like (examples are great): I like the keyboard on the [chromebooks](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/acer-c7-chromebook.html#ac-c7) thats for sure **Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)** * Long battery life -vs- Low weight: Low weight * Build quality -vs- Low price: Build quality * Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: low noise/heat **Would you pay a premium for something that has:** * High resolution screen: yes * A great keyboard: yes * A great touchpad/mouse buttons: yes * Great audio: As long as it has decent output through headphones I don't need great speaker audio. **List any features that are critical:** (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, matte screen, etc.)none that I can think of but if there are any that you guys think would be beneficial to my situation I'd love to hear recommendations :)

1gcmkp	-21463	1371231484	pcgaming	What should I expect in terms of next gen gaming video card requirements on PC? [xpost r/games]	Not to long ago I sold my xbox 360 because I didn't play games as much as I used to. I used the money to get some steam cards because they were having some summer sale and I wanted to get a few indie games that looked fun and were cheap. Anyway fast forward to the present and I've started playing games again because of all the cheap sales on Steam and shit and for the most part I've had no problems. I managed to complete the whole bioshock series, xcom, the mass effect series, the portal series, and a few indie games. The only problem I've run across was when I was playing Bioshock: Infinite the video card graphics requirements were way out of my league (I'm running bootcamp on a 2011 iMac) and so many of the textures looked absolutely horrible. I managed to get through the whole game (loving it all the way) but now that I think about it, it does worry me that with my current set up I won't be able to run any next gen games on my system so I'm wondering If I should just stop investing more money into my PC games because I won't be able to support them and start saving up for a next gen console?**tl;dr: Using an iMac with bootcamp to PC game. Video hasn't been a problem till I played Bioshock Infinite and now I'm worried whether or not I'll have the same problem with next gen games on PC. Am I going to have to switch back to console gaming for newer games?**

1y8wij	-21463	1392737332	anime	Just learned my university has a large lending library and I'd like to use it to watch some good anime I haven't seen before.	Normally I just stick to Netflix but since I have access to such a large library of dvds I thought it'd be nice to branch out and see if I can find anything else.I usually tend to gravitate more towards anime that isn't really action-oriented and more Slice-of-life oriented. Somethings I've recently watched that I can say I liked:[Welcome to the NHK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_to_the_N.H.K.) - Absolutely loved this one.[Samurai Champloo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai_Champloo) -  While this one is about two swordsman I still feel the major focus of the show was not the action scenes.[K-On!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-On!) - What can I say. I have a guilty pleasure for lighthearted, fun-filled adventures of people with no real problems.[Case Closed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Closed) - This isn't really slice of life either but it's still a long ways away from shounen. [The Devil is a Part Timer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_Is_a_Part-Timer!) This one is also kind of action-y at times but once again I feel the action really isn't the focus. Just seeing supernatural beings interacting in slice of life ways is really funny.Cute characters in a cute show is all I need usually.EDIT:[Sgt. Frog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgt._Frog) - Long time favorite of mine. Just a stupid comedy with lovable characters. What more could I ask for.
1yuvsk	-21463	1393297658	TheSimpsons	Have the Simpsons always been this dated?	I was born in '95 so by the time I had come into the simpsons when I was 10 I had missed out on a lot of the Simpsons' best years. I still watch a lot of the new episodes and enjoy them fairly regularly but there is something I have noticed that bothers me a little. I noticed a lot of the newer episodes date themselves like every 10 minutes. I watched a couple of the newest episodes on Hulu today and in two of the episodes like half the jokes were bad social-media/smartphone jokes, another episode was entirely based on Google Glass, and the most recent one I watched had a (rather unfunny) joke about the movie Gravity in it. Obviously I did not grow up with the Simpsons during their earlier years so I'm wondering did they date themselves as much back then? It's something I've never thought about but maybe because I'm younger I just haven't noticed the dated jokes.

It isn't helpful if we have a bunch of different comments for the same game* 2) if you see the game you wanted to submit has already been submitted, simply upvote it; please no downvotes on any valid submissions.* 3) if you want to submit multiple games, post them in multiple comments so they can each be upvoted individually* 4) The format to submit follows: * [GAMESYSTEM] - GAME-TITLE - REGION  * No abbreviating game names * ex: [Xbox 360] - Grand Theft Auto V - USA * ex: [PS3] - Little Big Planet - USA * ex: [PC] - Castle Crashers - USAHope we can get this together!EDIT:

If this is a problem please let me know and I am more than willing to let someone else take over coordinating a playdate for this week in place of myself. Sorry for the confusion.**ORIGINAL POST**So about two weeks ago I made a post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Internet_Box/comments/21095a/internet_box_community_playdate_poll/) about a potential playdate and there seemed to be enough of interest in a Halo 3 playdate to get something going. I'll be honest the one with the most upvotes was L4D2 but my PC is on the fritz right now so if someone else wants to organize that go right ahead and be my guest. As for Halo 3, its still one of my favorite online multiplayer games and I think it'd be a blast if we got a full party together and maybe play some actionsack or social slayer or something next weekend. Instead of wasting time and holding a poll to find a best time I'm just going to plan for next Saturday at 8PM CST. If you think this sounds fun and are free next Saturday 8PM CST* Please leave your xbox gt and we can get this thing going! If enough people demand a different time I am willing to change it but for the time being I am planning for 8PM CST*8pm Central Standard Time = 6pm PST, 7pm MST, 8pm CST, 9pm EST
23hxlf	-21463	1397979539	Ubuntu	Ubuntu 10.04 or 14.04	Looking to download a linux distro and was recommended Ubuntu. Played around with the most recent stable build, 14.04, on my friends machine and I had previously used 10.04 in a computer lab. From what I remember of 10.04 it didn't have the dock bar that 14 does (I don't know exactly what it's called) and I can't say I am a huge fan of it. Personally I prefer the old navigation bar that 10.04 had that let me find programs and different folders/directories quicker (also I just think it looked better). Would there be anyway to fix this in 14.04? Are there any huge advantage to using 14.04 if I can't? Is 10.04 still supported? I don't know linux very well and any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

25vfno	-21463	1400432960	learnprogramming	[Java/C] How are multidimensional arrays represented in memory?	How are multidimensional arrays represented in memory? What is a non-abstracted (or less abstracted) look at arrays in memory? is the representation of an array dependent on the language you program in?I began programming in Java last year and was told that a 2D array was an array of arrays. The memory address of a containing array (whose indices corresponded to row number)  would point to a series of memory addresses for other arrays (whose indices corresponded to column number). So to find the element of an 2D array at position (5,4) the computer would first go to the variable that stores the 2d array which would hold a memory address to where the row array started. From there it would just hop over 5 memory slots to get to the 5th position and in that 5th position there would be a memory address for where to the column array starts. It would go to that memory address and then hop over 4 spaces and then it would have found the value/Object we were looking for. I began reading a few C books in preparation for a class I will be taking in the fall and how the book explained multidimensional arrays is that it is all just represented in memory as one long sequence of positions in memory. So if for instance you had an 8x8 array and you were looking for the element at position 5,4 then you would just hop forward 44 positions in memory to find that element (5th row * 8 columns + 4 more columns) as opposed to hopping around with memory addresses and going through a bunch of different arrays.Which one of these is closer to the truth? is it different across different languages?

28e7m4	-21463	1403032950	malefashionadvice	Looking for a new set of shoes. Less for fashion and more for utility, but I think you guys could help me find a balance between the two	So this past weekend I went to an all day concert festival and have started using my bike as my main method of transportation and have started to notice my current set of shoes not holding up to all of the activity. I am looking for a shoe that looks good while still maintaining enough utility to keep my feet from hating me. Shoes I've owned and liked:* a number of Vans Authentics and knock off vans authentics. I love the simple, small cloth sneaker look. It terms of fashion they usually are super versatile and when they wear they still look pretty good. I don't like how they have virtually no support for my foot. * toms classics. I know this sub really hates toms (and maybe the whole espadrilles style?) but I've always LOVED the minimalistic Bruce-lee-clothe-slipper look. Especially during summer it just gives that less-is-more look that I like. I hate that the sole is essentially like walking on the flat ground and I hate that if I don't buy those garbage socks that don't fit my feet right then they look stupid and without socks they smell like death itself.So I guess what I'm looking for is a shoe with kind of the same cloth-minimal look (I hate the plastic glossy look that most trainers have) but with some kind of support so that I can wear them for active events.

I know a lot of people bought the Vita TV almost exclusively as a Persona4G box (like myself), and if you don't have friends who are into Persona maybe you haven't heard of this but the Persona adventure doesn't have to stop at P4G.  There is a version of Persona 3 known as Persona 3 Portable that is playable on the Vita TV as well! This game was originally for PSP I believe, and as such there are some minor drawbacks. One of these drawbacks is that there are no animated cutscenes and the game is done in much more of a virtual novel style. If this is a turn off to you, a friend told me about a guide posted on Giantbomb [here](http://www.giantbomb.com/profile/tafae/blog/p3p-with-p3fes-cutscenes-guide/95858/) that will link you to the correct cutscenes at the correct time from P3FES that you miss in P3P. In other words, if you are having a blast with P4G considering picking up P3P and using this guide to experience another great game in (most of) all of its glory!

I tried looking at LazyFoo's tutorial, but the setup page for OS X seems broken and I can't seem to find any other tutorials that use Xcode 5. Could anyone guide to me to getting started? It's incredibly frustrating not even being able to start :(

If you haven't heard of Penile Pearly Papule's here's a link: http://www.channel4embarrassingillnesses.com/conditions/pearly-penile-papulesI think I've had PPP since I was a preteen, or when ever I actually started paying attention to my penis. After learning more about sex and our sex organs in school I figured mine didn't look normal. I never told any one not even my parents.  Fast forward to current times, I'm still very embarrassed of my penis. Since I'm uncircumcised it's easy to hide and I have been successful in hiding them with every sexual partner I've had excluding one. She was my GF for about 5 years. I guess I was careless when we were getting intimate and she notice them. I could tell she was completely freaked out, which was my worst fear, but after I showed her some things on the internet I think she came to accept it. She didn't want to stop having sex with me, but I still felt like it bothered her.To this day I still hide it. I feel the conversation is not worth the trouble or the embarrassment, but I wonder how other men with PPP handle it with their sexual partners and maybe offer tips on how to bring it up to my SO to make it easier to talk about.Thanks in advance!

2fsr05	-21465	1410174737	bengals	I became a Bengals because they have the illest looking jerseys in the NFL.	Granted I solidified my loyalty to the Bengals over 10 years ago, but currently there are some teams with nice looking uniforms. I was born and currently reside in Las Vegas, NV. No pro football team out here, so around the age of 14 I chose the Bengals cause those tiger stripes with the black and orange just looked so sexy. So when people ask me why I like the Bengals they get a laugh out of my response. Anyone else out there have a story of how they became loyal to a sports team through a similar or unconventional way?

My girlfriend's relationship with her gay (male) roommate has gotten really toxic. It all started when a few weeks ago she told him she wasn't planning on renewing the lease with him due to the fact she felt uncomfortable with his life style (selling drugs out of the apartment, the random foot traffic in and out, his hardcore drug usage, and verbal abuse). Now she's at the point where she no longer wants him to be there and wants him out immediately, but the lease isn't up for 5 more months.Now, his name is not on the lease or any of the utilities, just hers. He's been there since she moved in 7 months ago. I've read up on some land lord/tenant laws and I understand he needs to be formally evicted with documentation and notice. I was wondering if any of you have dealt with something like this before. I know laws vary by state. We live in Nevada if that helps any. Maybe you can give advice or insight on what to do. This person is very unstable, probably cause of the drug usage and my GF feels really unsafe living with him. She's currently staying with parents.

It's easy to hide wearing cloths cause it looks as If I just have large pecs and I work out a lot (which I do), but it's an illusion.

1pk625	-21470	1383161473	Fitness	Weight vs Form	I have hit this mental wall and am confused. Looking for some clarification. I am sure this has been asked before but hopefully not too many times.I have been training for about 8 months first doing SS and eventually adding some additional isolation stuff. I have made good gains and have met some of my initial goals but have taken a few weeks off here and there due to traveling and other responsibilities. I digress.Since I started lifting again I have learned a lot of about focusing on form and have tried different approaches when it comes to sets / rep amounts. I just can’t fully wrap my head around when it is the right time to up the weight. I watched a video with Kai Greene and he mentioned how he "will never be a weight lifter." The video showed him only curling 30 pounds….but the dude is like 10 times bigger than me.Should I be content to get to a “lower” weight like that and never lift more? I am not looking to be a power lifter or a body builder. My goal is to get stronger, look more healthy, and increase overall fitness so maybe the words of a famous bodybuilder shouldn't impact me?TLDR: How do you know the right time to increase weight? Is it worth sacrificing form to jump up? Is it purely based on goals / program?

Ive been trying to find a bottle of [Linkwood 15 year (Gordon &amp; MacPhail) speyside single malt scotch](http://imgur.com/sfvn4qC) since a friend gave me a glass.  Ive had no luck so far in my area (WI). I am newer to the wide world of scotch so I am also open for suggestions based on the Linkwood. All I really know is that I enjoyed the flavors from this Linkwood.  Im trying to find a bottle to pair with a DE FFP for my upcoming birthday. I have cigars for trade or would also just pay if you locate a bottle. Im also open to a combination of trade/$ as well as other things based on if we have similar hobbies. Any input or advice is greatly appreciated.Im currently enjoying a Davidoff Nicaragua Tubo with some Four Roses Single Barrel, what are you smoking?  Thanks in advance for the help!

It's rather stupid but think about it, we are now 24k and growing,  this subreddit is the official one that will count once the game releases, it's probably the number 1 best place where you can find info. This subreddit could have AMA's with the developers in the future, maybe after the release regarding new updates and stuff. I am quite sure hello games visits this already and knows about us. So why not make it official, be recognised by hello games themselves  as "the no man's sky community" and maybe have exclusive interviews and content published here? 
3g93jz	-21493	1439048761	NoMansSkyTheGame	Discussing NMS planet diversity with a friend	So yesterday evening i was discussing all the hype around NMS with a friend and we started reasoning about a thing that usually people prefer ignoring, at least until the game is out (many games have had nice promises but in practice they have been criticized for this aspect).the thing is actual planet diversity.so we know that there will be lots of different "biomes", ok, but how many?let's say planet A has a "sandy" biome, and planet B has the same too. what differentiates the two planets? probably how mountains or hills are generated, the type of creatures that live there (if there are any) but in the end we have two different planets that look pretty much identical.don't get me wrong i am going to play NMS as soon as it gets released and i will keep playing it for a long time, as i  really like the idea behind the game, but i'm just reasoning a bit right now.try thinking, after like 20/30 planets you visit you might have basically seen most biomes, according to this reasoning. what makes planets different then?please prove me wrong, destroy what i have just said with positive speculation, because obviously we can just hope for the game being really diverse.

2azrj5	-21501	1405634104	buildapc	Anti AMD sentiment.	Recently I have noticed that there is bit of an anti AMD sentiment on this sub. Personally I don't believe that either CPU is better than the other and it just comes down to what the PC is going to be used for that dictates which one should be used. But a lot of people seem to think that when it comes to building a gaming PC, AMD is not even an option and that Intel is the clear choice. So I decided to put together some videos that I think explore the subject pretty well. And I encourage builders that when someone comes in asking for help we let go of our personal biases and focus on what is best for them even if its something we wouldn't prefer for ourselves. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIT9uLDjZcghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu8Sekdb-IEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiQV7SFoZq4https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiQV7SFoZq4https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvLRZxRL8N8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBeeGHozSY0

1xaxhu	-21509	1391807515	asoiaf	(Spoilers All) The One True Religion?	So I've mainly been commenting and scouring this sub because I see pretty much any thought-provoking question or topic for discussion I have, having already been discussed.One thing I haven't noticed mentioned, at least directly, regarding the efficacy and presence of the major religions in ASOIAF, and one in particular:**Is the Lord of Light the only true God?** I ask this because thus far we have only seen explicit "proof" of the power of this deity (Mel's Shadow Baby -ACoK, multiple resurrections by Red Priests -ASoS, and Moqorro's healing of Victarion -ADwD, though the exact details of the last one are not given). Many people seem to think it's (other than resurrections) just magic and manipulation of worldly things (chemicals, plants, etc.) but that seems unlikely since different Red Priests hailing from different areas, likely with different understandings of the religion are able to practice it. Also, Thoros who was portrayed as a mediocre Red Priest and not particularly skilled in any practices, or particularly devout, ends up being, arguably, the most successful of them all (5 resurrections, I believe?).Of all the other religions, the only example I can think of is Patchface somehow being a manifestation of the Drowned God's power, since he spent 2 days underwater and survived (now demented but basically prophetic) (ACoK).The Seven? Not a whisper of their actual presence or power. In fact, I've noticed a pattern: a significant portion of people who pray for to the Seven end up having bad things happen to them shortly thereafter. Granted it could be argued that they're already in dire circumstances, but shouldn't at least one of these prayers be answered with tangible proof of divine intervention? And when Maester Cressen plays poison chicken with Mel, he loses (ACoK).The belief of the Faceless Men is a bit different especially considering modern science would dictate that death would occur whether or not they believe all the Gods of Death of different religions are the Many Faced God.Any and all thoughts regarding the religions in ASOIAF are welcome.*EDIT: formatting**EDIT: I should have been clear, I meant not that there definitely is a God or Gods but rather that the people in Westeros could be galvanized into following the Lord of Light since they see some sort of "proof." (hence my quotes around it in the original post). That is to say, in the eyes of the people of Westeros, would the Lord of Light be the one true God?
1y18hh	-21509	1392521463	asoiaf	(Spoilers All) What are some historical and cultural references GRRM has stuck into the series for our entertainment?	I did a search and I can't find any threads made explicitly for cultural references so I figured I'd get the ball rolling. I did find a couple for historical references but they looked like they never got much attention. Of course, there should be many historical references as history influences most writers and GRRM seems to have paid homage to a lot of mythology and history in his work.Examples:Historical - The Red Wedding being a reference (based off of) the [Black Dinner] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Douglas#Black_Dinner)Cultural - Strong Belwas shitting in Meereen's general direction (Monty Python)AlsoThe Volantene Triarch Belichio (Belicheck) who was undefeated in battle until he was eaten by giants (NFL; Giants handing the Pats two Superbowl losses). Also NFL: Ser Patrek with the Dallas Cowboys star on his shield being crushed by Wun Wun a Giant. (Dallas crushed by the NY Giants)--thanks to /u/hogwarts5972 for pointing that one out to me on another thread!And"Janos" Slynt's duplicity and character possibly being a reference to the two-faced Roman deity [Janus] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus)Anything you think might be a reference to historical events, pop culture, or argots from our world is fair game!
200lp9	-21509	1394419266	nba	George Karl on the Wizards	So I was watching ESPN the other day and George Karl (still feels weird seeing him as an analyst type instead of a coach these days) was giving his two cents on the upcoming playoffs. One point in particular that got me interested was his saying "Wizards are the biggest threat to the Heat not named Pacers."My friends and I are huge Wiz fans and even we think that's a bit too much credit to give them. I mean no one should underestimate us but Toronto and Chicago both seem just as good if not better.What do you guys think? Is Karl devaluating the Raptors and/or Bulls? Or maybe he's suggesting that specifically the Wizards are a worse matchup for the Heat than the others?One thing to keep in mind is that thrashing the Wiz gave the Heat (114-97) midway through January. We also lost to them 103-93 early in the season and have two more meetings (tomorrow and the end of the season), so those could also shed some light on this.Also, my apologies but I couldn't find a link quoting Karl making that comment but I assure you it's real, they spent a good 10 minutes discussing it.

29mg0i	-21509	1404273508	soccer	Who is your favorite referee so far this World Cup?	It can be favorite for whatever reason.For me it has to be Benjamin Williams (AUS). God, I just love his dorky looking smug smile whenever he tells someone to get up and stop simulating. His hand motions, shakes of the head and general mannerisms are just priceless and I hope he still refs a game or two.From what I've gathered, he's also a pretty good ref. No nonsense, fair calls both ways in both of his games. He gave Defour a deserved red against South Korea that definitely altered the feel of the game, and I like that he wasn't afraid to do so.A parting gift, his smug smile: http://images.the-afc.com/afc/referees/pix/AUS_Williams_Benjamin_Jon.jpg

2iykwd	-21509	1413049813	fantasyfootball	How will Dallas WRs fare in Seattle? &amp; Defensive Matchups	Honest question, since I've been hearing a lot of talk about it. Obviously the Seattle D is elite--especially at home. However, we saw what Desean Jackson managed to do against them last week (though admittedly that was in Washington and Sherman was on Garcon a lot). Do you think Dez or Terrence Williams will manage to put up a 13-15+ score against them (or any other WR)?Also, how do you think Seattle will match up their defense against Dallas WRs?
2jkr9z	-21509	1413600102	fantasyfootball	Oakland WRs	Now that Derek Carr is managing to throw the ball with more success, we're seeing a couple new passing options for the Raiders.James Jones was the clear #1 until their past two games, during which Andre Holmes beat him 20 to 13 in terms of targets, and outscored him in fantasy (13-8, 24-11). Also, Brice Butler has emerged as a #3 option.My main question is: Who do we consider the #1 Wide Receiver going into Sunday's game? Jones or Holmes? Obviously, it's not clear at the moment, but what are your opinions?

2jmxex	-21509	1413665354	fantasyfootball	Deep-League Prospect: Michael Campanaro	Probably haven't heard of him, right? 5'9" 192lb rookie WR drafted by Baltimore in the 7th round. I only know of him because he went to my college, Wake Forest. My freshman year he was a junior and he was like 90% of our offense. Actually met him once through a couple of my friends on the team, before he went pro, which was pretty cool.He's a naturally athletic, explosive and decent over distance. He's got some nifty moves and superglue hands. Possible weaknesses are height, physical health (broken hand and collarbone as well as hamstring injuries all in college) and strength (he's pretty tough, not sure if he's NFL tough yet though).Last weekend against Tampa he made his debut and went 2-2 for 28 yards and a TD. This wasn't garbage time either, it was late 1st and early 2nd quarter when Flacco was launching balls everywhere.Obviously, he's still speculative, especially considering how successful Baltimore's offense already is (not sure if he'll even play). BUT, if you're watching this weekend, look out for him and see what you think--especially if you're desperate for a WW pickup xD!
2lq0yj	-21509	1415494806	fantasyfootball	[Discussion] Deep-League Wide Receiver Cuffs?	So most of us are familiar with the concept of a "handcuff" to an RB (for those who don't know it's basically picking up the backup RB on a team as well as the starter in case the latter gets injured).I would like to open the floor to discussing handcuffs in the context of wide receivers. Earlier this season in my 16-team league, I picked up Odell Beckham Jr. since I enjoyed watching him play for LSU and lacked a little depth at WR. At the time, I figured he would not be relevant until next year, and I didn't consider starting him since I had Victor Cruz already.Lo and behold, four days later Cruz goes down with a season-ending injury and I lose my best WR. Picking up OBJ saved my WR production, since Cruz's injury upgraded OBJ to WR2/3 status, and he may progress even further given the Giants' current WR woes. In retrospect, I cuffed Cruz and boy am I glad I did so. I also have Davante Adams and I've recently noticed people speculating his upside if Nelson or Cobb gets injured (though I don't own either).It would seem handcuffing a WR could be a good strategy in deeper leagues where waiver wire talent is scarce. It certainly minimizes damage done to your fantasy team if the better player gets injured. What are your thoughts?

Unless I am mistaken, microwaves function by vibrating molecules in whatever is being heated, and the ambient temperature in a microwave is the same as the surrounding temperature (if nothing was in a microwave it would not change the temperature).  This leads me to believe the rate of change of temperature cant be proportional to the temperature difference between the object and its surroundings.If this is correct, what is the rate of change of something being heated in a microwave?

tl63r	-21537	1336930033	Datsun	Advice on building a s30	Hey guys, I've completely fallen in love with the 240z and and considering trying to buy one (rust free as possible but otherwise the cheaper the better) to rebuild.  However, I thought I'd get some advice first.First of all I do have experience working on cars, but I have never done a full rebuild, so this will be a first for me.  I also realize this will likely be an ongoing long term project.  However, the faster I can get it derivable the better.My goals for the car would be something sporty I could track, but mostly something to drive around when its nice outside (not a DD).  I'm aiming for around 300 hp (with room for possible improvements).I'm hoping you guys could give me some advice on how to go about this (mostly worried about engine/transmission). I have the urge to throw some kinda of V8 under the hood, or a RB26DETT seems viable (though I admittedly dont know much about that engine).  Finally, advice on the 240z vs. the 260z vs. the 280z?  It seems the 280 might be the best bet for adding power, and weight reduction seems faily simple.  Any advice on roads to pursue would be greatly appreciated.  Also, ideas on how much time and money I'm going to be looking at for a project like this?  I'm not trying to spend every dime I have on this project, but if I do it I'd prefer do it right and no cut corners.
vro63	-21537	1340927068	Datsun	estimate cost of 280/240z build	I'm really set on buying a 240/280z and would really appreciate some advice on how much this is going to cost me.  Plans would involve a body kit and stance similiar to [this](http://www.egarage.com/car-profiles/datsun-240z-hre-wheels/) beautiful machine, l28et, and new exhaust. (at least for now)Ball park, what kinda investment am I looking at?  I can do a decent amount of work myself, but not everything.  I assume I'd be better off buying a car in good shape instead instead of buying a cheap car that needs tons of work.  I've seen a few cars (280z) in the 3-6K range, what kind of of quality should I expect for that price?Edit:  Thanks for the responses! so far jas has suggested 10-15k for a restore, anyone have information otherwise?
vrxd6	-21537	1340937129	Fitness	knee pain from squat	After my last squat workout I got a fairly bad pain in my right knee just above my knee cap.  I felt a little uncomfortable after my 4th set, but figured I'd do my last set, concentrate on my form, and just stop if it hurt. Did the whole set, form felt good, and my knee didnt hurt.  However, about halfway through putting the plates back the pain started and I had to call it a day at the gym.  I'm just going to RICE for now and see how it feels I guess.  Any ideas or advice?Info that might be relevant: heavy squats (last set was 5x335), i've been bulking and my squat has been going up recently after a long plateau, i generally stop a hair shy of parallel with anything over 315 b/c i get stuck as soon as I break parallel with heavy weight, and I've been low on sleep recently (I know thats not a combination for heavy lifting).

1yi6n7	-21537	1392953590	solotravel	Travel to Asia	Hi all,I just discovered this subreddit and am looking for a few pointers.  I've recently finished college and have some free time to travel until April 10th.  I don't have much experience traveling alone, and have never been anywhere in Asia before.  To help get the most out of my trip I was thinking of doing a tour to get started.  So far I've found Student Universe (something like [this](http://www.studentuniverse.com/tour/rajasthan-cycling-ahda)) and contiki (trips like [these](http://www.contiki.com/destinations/asia/tours?operational_region=5)).  Does anyone have any experience with these, or have other recommendations?Also, I'm all for nightlife, but a bit more interested in seeing new places/cultures.Edit: should probably mention I'm from New Jersey, USAEdit: couple places I had marked are Bangkok, Phuket, Hanoi, Ha Long Bay, Sa Pa, Luang Prabang, Phu Quoc Island, Pha That Luang, My Son Ruins, and Wat Phu.  Nothing set in stone, just some ideas.

1zesux	-21537	1393824173	whatcarshouldIbuy	What to compare to an e46 m3	I've been considering buying an e46 M3 for a while now, but am having a hard time committing to the idea of an 8+yo car.  I've budgeted around 30k (preferably under, though could go a hair over is something extraordinary came up).  Background, I'm 22, in the US, recently finished my masters degree, virtually no student debt, and a good salary.  Looking for something sporty (strong preference for manual) and practical, it'll will be a DD and tracked a few times a year.  I'm planning on doing a reasonable amount of maintenance myself to alleviate upkeep costs.I've also considered a BRZ, but I'd like a slightly bigger car, and its a little underpowered (and a supercharger basically negates the advantage of a new car). E9x M3s are starting to get close to my price range, but newer cars = harder to do basic maintenance myself.  Things like a sti/evo would be great, but a little too boy racer in my mind (amazing cars though).Any suggestions on other cars to consider?

3bpgqb	-21537	1435718143	weightlifting	Knee pain, advice needed	The last couple months I've started squatting lower consistently and I've also been really active during that time.  Not terribly surprising, but I've started getting a bit of discomfort in my left knee.  The pain (really more discomfort) is always, I actually notice it much less when running or lifting.  I've been tracking it the last week and a half and it hasn't gone away so I'm getting a bit concerned.So questions:1)I've been told squatting below parallel puts extra stress on your knees? Truth? If so how do you mitigate this?2)I'm leaning towards tendonitis from overuse.  For anyone who  has had something similar, how did you manage it/recover?

CAWs play a HUGE part of my experience with WWE games and if I can't enjoy them due to PS4 not having the ability to play custom music, then I'm honestly considering not picking this game up, despite buying every one since WWF Warzone.Anyone else stressing this as much as I am?

I've had my ears pierced since about 8th grade, and about freshman year is when I started to stretch them eventually going up to a 0g by jr to senior year. After high school my boss wanted me to take them out and I've had nothing in for about a year but I was just messing around with an old 4g lightly pushing and it went in about 1/2 way before I felt any sort of pain. So I was wondering if I started at something like an 8g how easy would it be to eventually get back up to a 0g.

2wxrlm	-21563	1424740587	Terraria	[PC] Tips for the pumpkin moon.	I have pretty end game armor and weapons, but I have no clue why I cant clear the pumpkin moon. I get to about wave 10-12 and then just constantly die until dawn. I've been using the spectre healing set with razorpine or razorblade typhoon. I have a bat scepter but it seems too slow for healing to me. My accessories are as follows: Menacing Destroyers Emblem, Menacing Sorcerers Emblem, Angry Ankh Shield, Wings, Spiked Celestial Stone.I have an arena rigged with flame traps, spiked ball traps, and lava on the floor, it also has a cannon but if I'm using it I don't get the healing I need thus dying that much faster. So my question is why am I seeing all types of videos where people clear the event so easily while i can barely get 3/4 through it, and what can I improve to clear it?TL:DR. Why cant I clear pumpkin moon in full spectre (healing) with razorpine and trap arena with good accessories?

301pdl	-21563	1427139678	heroesofthestorm	[Suggestion] Bigger bundle discount if you already own some of the heros.	For example I own the Starter Bundle and Tyrande and her blood elf skin, so me paying $40 for the Battle Bundle is sort of a rip off since I already own 3/4 of it. But I have no other options if I want the golden wolf.If I bought everything that I don't already have from the Battle Bundle I would be spending roughly $25.97 before tax. Which makes the golden cyber wolf worth $14.02, in my opinion not worth the price. But may be worth the price if the whole bundle was say $17 or $20, again since I already own most of it.

I usually am a Cope WG kind of guy, as i explained to my friend on our walk over.  We were literally talking about the different kinds and we brought up Cope longcut and how i had never tried it.  Fast forward 5 minutes into the walk, we were making our way behind the gas station as there is an alley i always walk through that leads right next to the doors.  It's dark and i notice something on the ground... I shit you not it was a full can of Cope long cut.  Then, I go onto this subreddit the next morning, what do I see, it's the damn dip of the week, this shit is crazy..

Everything was going fine, except there has always been this cell standby issue that always takes up a majority of my cell battery usage, but it'll still last 2 days with a single charge, while still frequently using it. However, I got a new update yesterday to 4.0.4 I think. After I updated it, I fully charged it last night, and when I woke up it was already 8% battery life!?When I looked at battery usage, it spiked to about 87%, compared to it being 30 ~ 40% before. Has anyone else experienced this with the new update?

1bhylu	-21726	1364880697	math	Applied Math Major	Hello r/math,I'm currently in my 2nd semester of school at my local community college. My original plan was transferring as an electrical engineering major. So far, I've finished up to calc 2 in highschool, getting a 5 on both Calc AB and BC exams. I took calc 3 last semester and passed with a 96% final grade. I am now enrolled in differential equations, and passing it with ease.However I'm also currently enrolled in my first semester of physics and it is not going so well. I'm struggling to do well on tests even after using my school's math and science tutoring center. I definitely put more time in physics than in my math classes, but I am not getting anywhere near the same results. I feel like physics is just not my subject. I also believe that all my engineering courses use this physics as a foundation, seeing as I need at least the second course of physics to start taking my engineering courses.My question is, should I just stick with engineering, or should I switch my major to something more math related, like applied math. I'm not entirely sure what I can do with an applied math degree. Are there any other options for someone who is good at math besides a math degree?

As of right now, I am an applied math major, but after taking my econ classes, I'm also interested in managerial economics. My question is how easy is it to double major in math/managerial economics? I just need differential equations to finish my major classes for applied math, but there is no way I can finish all the prereqs for managerial economics by spring 2014. In my case, would I just get in as an applied math major, and then take prereqs to managerial economics? Does anyone have experience with transferring in and then double majoring?Also, does anyone have experience with applied math and mathematical &amp; scientific computation? They have the same prereqs, but I'm not sure what I should transfer as. Is mathematical &amp; scientific computation more like math + cs? or would applied math be more like that?

The decks I had were pellinore GP and spike bros with dudley emperor. Right before I stopped, I heard the new royal paladin and kagero were gonoing to the best decks. Is this still the case? What would be the best deck for me to make that doesn't require a lot of money. The notable cards I have are 4 garmore, 4 ezel, 4 gold paladin perfect guards, 3 silent toms, 4 ceo's, and spike bros stuff.

For about 640 usd, I can get it with 1080p display with an amd 8750m gpu. However, it seems like HP does not make quality laptops, and I don't want to buy a laptop that will die or have problems within a few months. I also heard that the screen on this laptop isn't good?I just want something that has a 1080p display and can play League of  Legends and CS:GO at 60+ fps. I don't really care how the game looks, so I'm ok with playing at the lowest possible settings.

Or should I just purchase this one? I really just want the keycaps, but since these are PBT in a nice color scheme, this board seems like a very nice deal.Also, is there a difference between this model and the shine besides the LEDs? The shine 3 has a TKL version that I prefer, but its a bit more expensive than this one.
270nvw	-21726	1401611271	UCDavis	Transfer student questions	Hi I am a newly admitted transfer student who will be attending UCD in the fall. I have a few questions regarding the whole transfer process.1) There weren't any available orientation spots for me, so I won't get to meet with a counselor 1 on 1 and register for classes. On myucdavis, it only shows a pass 2 time for me, which is in late August. Isn't this a little late to be signing up for fall classes? Do I have to do something to get a pass 1 date? Will I have trouble signing up for my classes? I am a computer science major and I need to finish my lower division classes since the classes at my CC did not articulate. I need to take STAT 32, ENG CS 40, 50, and 60.2) I heard applications for apartments for this fall was done in the spring, so there aren't a lot of good apartments left. So should I just sign up with the Student Housing Apartments? I heard it is extremely expensive and overall not worth it. On the housing website, it states that a contract is from September 20, 2014 to August 14, 2015; does this mean that if I go through with the SHA, I have to live there for a whole year?

2horr2	-21726	1411899387	AskStatistics	Intro to probability theory pre-reqs	Hi, I am a new transfer student coming from a community college to a university. One of the classes I have to take is called Intro to Probability Theory. The pre-reqs for the class is the calculus series and linear algebra. I did ok in those classes, but I am sure I would remember most of the important concepts after reviewing them for a bit. My concern is that I have never taken a course in statistics ever. Would I still be able to do ok in this class without taking any statistics classes? My school starts next Thursday, so I still have time to change my classes. Should I sign up for elementary statistics, or should I just take Intro to Probabilty Theory?

I am looking for a temporary place to stay until I can find an apartment of my own. Do any redditors out there know of any long-term lodging places, or any sort of place like that that I might be able to stay at when there? Thanks in advance, Stevesy(TLDR: Moving and need a place to stay.)

I am currently staying at my cousin's place. I am looking for a 1br/1bath in the $7-900/mo range in the brickell, grove, or northern coral gabels area. Any help is appreciated. I'm still turning over the thought of having a roommate, so not sure on that route yet. Also, I have a car and motorcycle that will fit into one parking space, I just need a space to park. Thanks in advance. TLDR: looking for a 1/1 for $7-900 with parking in the mainland area of key biscayne.
q7sz0	-21735	1330324333	Miami	Movie or Bowling Meetup possibilities?	Hello Miamireddit.~~I am a bit of a movie buff, and enjoy watching film and talking about them afterwards. Would anyone be interested in doing this? I've just moved here recently, and as such have no friends to go watch movies with. I'm a huge geek, love terrible movies, and I'm not a critic. I don't want to talk about how keanu wasn't portraying the artist's original design for Van Helsing in the damn movie. I just want to talk about the movie. "This was good, I liked this, I liked that" Maybe discuss possible quotes that will arise from the movie, or reactions to certain parts. For example, Mr. lead actor in a movie says, a line attempting to be witty, what lines would have been better.~~~~Perhaps this would be best served at a coffee house or some other place near the theater that would not be opposed to being talkative, or be very expensive. (Also, I know not where theaters are here.)~~~~I'm sorry if I got on a soapbox there. It's late, I get a bit more passionate when that happens.~~As for bowling, I love to do it, and would like to find others that want to go out and have fun bowling. I'm not necessarily looking to commit to a league or anything yet, but that's for the future. Most of the alleys I know are on the more outskirts of the town. (Bird bowl, one in south miami, one on the beach, etc.) Any hints/tips?Tl;DR&gt; I want to go watch movies and talk about them after, not critique, just talk. I would also like to meet up with some people that like to bowl too. Edit: this is now a bowling thread mostly. I'm still up for movies though.EDIT: Alright. Plans are in the works. Tentatively, Bird bowl on a week from Friday or Saturday (for you weekenders). I'll make a meetup for it when I know. I need to find rates for all of the area ones. It looks like splitsville has specials running on Tuesdays, so probably tentatively plan one at splitsville two Tuesdays from now. Also a thing to note, Splitsville has a dress code after 8, so plan accordingly. Let me know if you're interested for any of those days. Bird also runs specials for other weekdays, so I can plan that too. 
qo4q5	-21735	1331253156	Miami	[19:00 Saturday] Bird Bowl	Hello again!I know this is short notice, but I'm looking to get a group together to go to Bird bowl this Saturday. I have one person aside from myself already going. The rates are: $30.99 for an hour per lane (up to 8 people) It's my experience that 6 to a lane is fairly good. then it's only $5-ish per person as well. Let me know in this post if you are going, so I can get an idea of who is interested. If I do not hear from anyone by Saturday morning, I'll cancel it and reschedule it for later. ~~I'll keep looking at this post, but I currently have no internet at home, and can't log in at work, so I guess comments are the best way to contact me.~~Thanks, and looking forward to seeing some fellow redditors out there!Bird bowl: http://www.birdbowl.com/Edit: Looks like there will be some of you there. I'll figure out some way to recognize me. I might just wait by my car. it's a black and yellow '71 Super Beetle. Should be easy to recognize. More on that later!

tbzsd	-21735	1336433674	beetle	Hello /r/beetle!	Hello all. First things first, 71 super, daily driver, not really stock anymore, but no real "modifications", just a lot of parts from other beetles. Now that that's over, I just wanted to say that I am glad to see that there are redditors out there that are fellow beetle enthusiasts. I am in South Florida at the moment. Some history of my car: She is originally yellow, from Texas, and was very well kept in her early life. She was owned by someone that had her regularly checked, and took her to a beetle dealership for repairs, had the radio option, and even had an aftermarket A/C installed by the dealer. (I have the reciepts from all this which were still in the glove box. Then, she was unfortunately barned for a few years at an unknown location. In 2005, my father passed her on the side of the road for sale and reported this to me later that night to see if I was interested in taking a look at her. Having always admired beetles, I of course said yes! She became my first car and I have loved her since. Since 2005, she has had some issues. Off the top of my head, clutch, front-end bushings and bearings, generator, and other minor issues. Today, I am sad to report that she is not is as good of shape as I'd like her to be. She is rusting on the driver's side floorboard, passenger side front fender, is in need of a paint job, possibly an engine overhaul (I'd like to do one.) and the clutch is slipping again. This all is due to the fact that I've not really had a good place to work on her for a while, and she is my daily. She has a bright future though! Once I move out of the place I'm in now, I plan to take her off the road and do a full restore myself on her. (Well, not a restore, per se. Just a rejuvination.) Engine work, Tranny work, Body work and paint job, etc. Thank you for reading, and I hope to be a part of the community here!TL;DR Bought in 2005, still a daily, in line for a tear-down and re-furbishing.P.S. She was bought in Massachusetts, where she lived for a year as I finished high-school.
10ek5n	-21735	1348511303	london	'Merican visitor from Oct. 10th to the 14th, has a few questions regarding gaming shops.	Hello London!I plan on doing much of the touristy things while there. The eye, some of the museums, the caves mentioned on the wiki look nice, Charing Cross street for the bookstores, as well as Cecil Court. I'm going to be at sea for about two weeks starting tomorrow before I get there, so I apologize for the short notice, but here's my question. I am an avid gamer of all types, as well as being a Sci-Fi fan. If any of you play Magic the Gathering, while I am gone, the prerelease and release for the next set, Return to Ravnica, are the weekends while I will be away from home. Do any of you know of any good shops that welcome newcomers, and possibly Americans that I may be able to pick up a draft of the new set? Perhaps a Friday night magic, or some other event going on? (I'm not sure where I'll be staying quite yet, but I do plan to buy an oyster card and use the underground. From what I understand, this is very convenient and can get you many places.)Also, on the note of Sci-Fi, are there any good sci-fi/fantasy/geekery shops that are tops?Thanks for your reading, and I do hope this is not another "Derp American" post. TLDR; Where can I find a good card gaming shop in London, as well as a good general sci-fi/fantasy/geekery/comic shop around?Afterthought: Is there anything or any behavior I should stay away from, being an American that I should avoid?Edit: Thank you all for your comments. Sorry to not be responding until now. I was at sea for my work.  I have an idea of a few places to go now, so thanks for that! I hope to see all that London has to offer in the short amount of time I have there. Thanks again for being kind and informational.
14kbcp	-21735	1355086691	ukulele	DIY Electric Uke Questions	Hello all,I've been subscribed for a while, but never posted. I have two ukes, a soprano and a concert, but I'm looking to start a project of an electric uke. I've wanted one for a while, but I'm not a huge fan of the ones out there, and I'd love to do my own design for the body. From the little research I've done, I'm sure I'll have to use metal strings, and and have found pickups for those, but suggestions for lower cost, but good pickups would be awesome. My main question to you, /r/uke, is a question of where to get reliable parts that I can pair up with my body. I'd like to get a pre-made neck, just to make it easier, with or without tuning pegs would be fine. Also, I'd be looking for a bridge. The non-part related questions being dimensions between neck and bridge for the right sound, and not really a whole lot else. Ah! I'm looking to build a concert as I tend to favor my concert now, as most of the chords are easier for my fingers. Soprano is okay, just a tad small at times. Thank you for taking the time to read, and I look forward to hearing. If I can get this done with relative success, I might even start making and selling a few!TLDR; I want to make an electric uke, but am looking for where to buy the complicated bits. 
1a7820	-21735	1363152875	StarWars	Am I the only one upset more about Star Wars Detours than TCW?	So, I know there's a lot of anger over the stopping of TCW and the uncertainty about 1313. I was looking forward to 1313, and now am worried about it as much as the next gamer. I have my own thoughts about TCW, and aren't as angry about that. What I was really looking forward to was Star Wars Detours. Finally, we have a completely different comedy take on the Galaxy Far Far Away, one that's not subscribing to canon and just going with fun in the characters. I know, there was the Robot Chicken Star Wars episodes, but this was tapping the creators of it, with a wonderful cast of voice actors, and continuing with the funny. I am most worried about the future of Star Wars Detours. It was one of the great highlights of Celebration VI.This does not make me any happier about the acquisition of Lucasarts by Disney. I didn't have a problem with it before, but now I'm starting to have doubts. I'll end my rant there and probably not get anywhere with this post, but I had to say it. TLDR; Star Wars Detours may be yet another tease from Lucasarts, destined for the Pit of Carkoon before we can even pass judgment. This possibility irks me.The link to the official release from Lucasarts on TCW and Detours: http://starwars.com/news/a-new-direction-for-lucasfilm-animation.html P.S.

1lsvsl	-21735	1378408078	StudentLoans	Consolidation assistance search	Hello /r/studentloans!I am a former student, in repayment of my student loans. I am current on my loans and have been in repayment for a while now. I just recently consolidated my federal student loans and would like to consolidate my private loans. A bit of backstory: I went to a private school that was costly per year and didn't get a whole lot of help from financial aid as my parents were in that bracket that doesn't allow me to get much, but since I'm one of three, they also didn't have the scratch to pay for each year of school. I have a job now and am *able* to pay each month and live, but I'm making no headway. I'd like to consolidate and see if I can knock off a bit per month from my private loans, but have met with unfortunate circumstances so far. I tried to consolidate through wells fargo before the fed consolidation was final, and they denied me without the chance to cosign. (I also had to leave one of my better interest rate loans off because the total was over their total consolidation amount.) In the past, I was behind on some of my loans, but as of earlier this year (Feb or Mar sometime) I have made everything current and been paying it back. So my credit might not be that great, but I didn't think it was that bad. I guess my question is, do any of you know of companies that I can go to with a mountain of undergrad private loan debt and work towards being able to continue to pay them off at a single source, possibly for less each month, while being able to live in a semi-okay apartment by myself. (Mine's shit at the moment due to financial restraints.)Thanks for reading!

1vvssl	-21735	1390425080	dogecoin	Hello fellow Shibes. Just started mining last night, I'm curious to see the kinds of rigs everyone runs.	Hello all. As the title states, I started last night after musing about it last week. (back when it was .37 for 1kdoge. Should have started then, lol. Much loss.) I'm running an Nvidia Geforce GTX 570 (produced by Gigabyte) with Cudaminer, and averaging about 150-160 Khash/s at around 70C. Just hobby mining, letting it run whilst I am not there during the day. What are y'all running for graphics cards and averaging for khashes? I know I could probably overclock everything and get better Khash, but it's my main computer and I need that video card for games and stuff. I don't want to overtax the card by overclocking and running it at much closer to 90C. Plus, it's just hobby mining right now, so it's fun. And I enjoy the community. Much happiness. Very Love!edit: info
1xlj27	-21735	1392105468	wicked_edge	DE Newb with some questions/comments	Hello Wicked Edge!I'm a relatively recent DE shaver (Started in early January) I kinda wish I had found W_E Before I bought, but here is what I have:I ended up getting a razor/handle from a guy at work that was switching to single-edge. (I later found out that this is from a Sally Beauty Supply store) I like the Razor well enough, and it was a cheap way to get into it. I bought a Van Der Haagen Kit off amazon with a sampler pack of about 60-65 blades (of varying types) I'm a bit frugal, so I've been trying to avoid paying some of the super high prices I'm seeing. The Van Der Haagen kit was $8.00 and came with bowl, soap, and boar brush. I see that the brush is on the avoid list, but to date, I'm not super upset at it with the price. Yes, it does shed, but if it lasts 6 months and gets me through the awkward learning phases, I'm fine with that. I've been shaving every few days (2-3) and in general using a new blade every few shaves (not because they are bad, but because I want to get a good feel for each different type and how they feel on my face.) Since I now know that I've not been lathering correctly, I might be going back to test ones I had passed up before. My pack came with samples of the following blades: Bic Chromium platinum, Treet Classic, Shark Super Chrome, Astra Superior Platinum, 7 Am Plus Hi Platinum, Derby Extra, Sharp Durablade, Dorco ST301, and Dorco ST-300. So far, I've liked the Dorco 301 the best out of the Skarks, Bics, Treets, the other Dorco, and even the Astras. This may change with lathering techniques, but I suspect not.As for other things I've picked up, I grabbed a couple of styptic pencils from a Family Dollar (about $1-1.50 for two thin pencils), and some Williams Mug soap. (I think it was $2) And I grabbed another brush which is a bit softer, but not much, and is smaller at Sally Beauty. All told, with a shared Prime I got the Van Der Haagen kit and sample pack for about $25 shipped, and have spent another $9-10 on styptics, soap, and second/travel brush. I found out once I went to the Sally near me that my particular handle/razor (the only DE one they have) runs about $10. Say what you want about quality, but it's a full metal handle, feels robust, and mine was used for a while before it came into my possession. (It was a little soap-scummy when I got it, but a toothbrush and some water cleared that right up.)So, with my new knowledge, I'm going to keep walking down the road of shaving the real way, abandoning all hope of cartridge-based razors (I have thick/coarse facial hair, so it would just jam up those things in a couple of swaths of mein face.) and experiment to my hearts content while trying to keep costs down for the most part. Also, I do have a quick question. I have one particular spot on my chin that doesn't seem to have the same grain as everywhere else on my face. (for the most part, left side goes one way, right goes another and it's similar story for my neck) I'd even go so far as to say that it doesn't have a specific grain, it just grows wild in that one part. Anyone have any ideas? (I'm still experimenting with trying to figure the grain, but there's only a few directions left to go.)Whew. It's late, and I've written a lot, and I should get going. TL;DR I got a DE and am experimenting while keeping costs down. My face has a strange spot of un-grained hair.  Yay Razors!
1yh6a5	-21735	1392932242	ukulele	Baritone Uke ID Help	Hello all,I came across and purchased a baritone uke a few months back at a secondhand store. It needed new strings (I knew it could handle wound strings as there was one still remaining on it and tuned-ish) And a couple of the eyelets/grommits (not sure of actual name) that fit into the head where the tuning pegs go through. The store said it was from the 70's, which I didn't trust, so I've been trying to find something on it and can't. The name sticker inside the body is Ariana and it says it's from Japan. The model number reflects BJ-100. It appears to be older, could be 70's, but might not be. I love the way it sounds and just want to find out its origins and what exactly I have in my hands. I'll try to post pics tonight when I get home, but I'm at work at the moment. I just wanted to see if anyone had any ideas just from that alone. For those keeping track, I finished an altoid-uke thanks to some help from /u/matingslinkys a few months back and will post pics of that too, if I get the chance. But that I'll post in a new post. Thanks!
1zn9kq	-21735	1394044622	MechanicalKeyboards	Looking to find an updated clicky mechboard that won't break the bank or take up a ton of space on my desktop. Impossible?	Hi /r/mechanicalkeyobards,I've been using for years. I picked up my first Model M in college, couldn't get it to work on my laptop and then ended up getting rid of it. :( Once I got a desktop and starting gaming more (and had ps/2 ports) I found another one for a few bucks, bought it and used it until I got my current one, which is a SIIG Minitouch that uses Alps switches. I love the feel of my model M, as well as the sound, but it takes up tooo much space. I currently use my Minitouch because it doesn't take up too much space and I also like the feel of the alps. I'm running into mild annoyances with the minitouch at this point as well. One annoyance is my own fault, when cleaning it the last time, I snapped the post on the enter key. Luckily, I'm a bit of a thrifter and sometimes check other places where people would be throwing things away or on craigslist, so I have a few boards. I still prefer either the buckling spring or the Minitouch's Alps over all. Cherry switches never felt firm enough for me, though I haven't tried greens. Anywho, back to the problem. snapped enter key post. Then I messed up the switch trying to get the post back out of the switch to use kragle or gorilla glue on it. Sadness. This keyboard has served me well for years now and the price was the best price ever. Look at collection of clicky's and find out that I have another SIIG keyboard from approximately the same era as the minitouch. Sure enough, it has the same alps switches. Two unsoldered switches later (I tried taking another switch apart to fix the first broken one), I had a fully working keyboard again minus the enter key. Being the mcguyver I am, I took the enter key from the sacrificial board's numpad and cut a spare crtl key from a set of keys I had lying around to create franken enter. It works, but not quite as well as before. The other irk is the lack of modern keys like the windows key and a little bit the size. It's the same size as my laptop, but or long typing sessions can be annoying. So my questions are these:Are Unicomp's buckling spring boards, like the ultraclassic worth it? are the the same switches as the Model M? Are they about the size of a standard keyboard? Are the alps in my Minitouch still used today, and if so, are there any sub-$100 boards that use them?TLDR: broke, mcguyvered, and frankensteined my SIIG Minitouch back to life, Model M just a bit too big, would like windows/alternate keys. Want a board with Alps like the Minitouch or with buckling spring keys like the model M. Can I get for under $100? Would like a tenkeyless board if possible, but can work with it. 
1zqusk	-21735	1394135972	sewing	Looking for advice of whether to sell or get parts for my Singer 603E machine.	Hi Threddit,I have had a Singer 603E machine for a few years now and it's always worked great. A few things here and there, a broken needle or two when I'm not paying attention, but nothing major. This brings me to my next dilemma. This weekend, I was trying to hem up something, overfilled the bobbin (near as I can tell, that was the initial issue), causing a mass of thread jammed up and inadvertently broke a needle from not paying attention. :(  got that cleared up and started sewing again. Couldn't get it to stitch correctly to save my life. Stopped after an hour or three of troubleshooting and frustration and looked at the machine again on Monday. Took out the bobbin container, and noticed one of the parts was out of whack. In my attempts to remove the thread stuck in it (not from this weekend) I snapped the errant piece. So now, I have to either try to get a new container, which is about $50 average (there are some cheaper and used, but I don't want used, and the cheaper ones I found weren't much and weren't places I felt terribly comfortable buying from) or, sell off to someone that already has one for parts or for someone else to use for its qualities and have them repair it. If I did this, I would be putting the money towards a newer machine, something like this: http://www.amazon.com/Brother-XL2600I-Affordable-25-Stitch-Free-Arm/dp/B000F7DPEQ/ref=sr_1_2?m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;s=arts-crafts&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394135773&amp;sr=1-2Basically a machine that has a newer bobbin system and that might be a bit more suited to my occasional use. I use it for costumes, basic hemming, etc. My dilemma is that I like my old machine, but everytime I think about it, I worry that I'll end up breaking it again due to lack of frequent use and thus losing familiarity with its workings. Then again, I tend to learn from my mistakes. Threddit, what do you think? I've heard that these older machines are sought-after. I have the stitch cams, (all of them) the book, and all of the pieces. It worked beautifully until this past weekend. 
20nh57	-21735	1395083593	wicked_edge	Possible uses for old blades?	Hello W_E.Back again with a question regarding used blades. Given the nature of a face blade, it is meant to have a good edge for your face, then to be thrown away when your hair has sufficiently dulled it. I've seen many blade banks, but I couldn't help noticing that the blade still has an edge even if not useful for your face anymore, it is quite useful for cutting things such as tape and boxes, etc. My question is this: Does anyone sell a blade holder that's a knife/boxcutter/whatever else for cutting for using DE blades? I think this would be a great way to reuse them and skip the bladebanks for a bit. Use one side, use the other, bladebank it, and then hopefully by then you'll have another 'used' blade to be put in. I'm thinking about making one of my own, but I don't seem to have a whole ton of time in the future, so if someone already makes one, it would be nice to know. Thanks again W_E!
218g0o	-21735	1395673492	MegaCon	Anyone else severely disappointed with the way the con ran this year?	I'm frustrated with the convention this year. I started going to Megacon around 2007-2008. I've been every year minus one, I think (probably 2011, can't remember too much) and this has been the worst. To me, it's simple, there were FAR too many people for that venue. Either the selling of tickets should have stopped or something limiting the number of people in the exhibitor's hall. I look at it from this perspective, and I'm sure it won't be popular, but I gotta speak my piece. I cosplay Boba Fett. I have spent a lot of time and money on this costume, and like to wear it, but also like to preserve it. I wore it for a total of 2 hours on Saturday because I was afraid of losing parts. The rows of people everywhere were far too small. I couldn't walk places anywhere while in costume without people physically bumping me whilst passing me. So, I went back to my hotel resignedly and got into my civvies. I thought, It will be better, you're just a bit wide and you'll be able to navigate the dealer floor easier. I was wrong. It was just too many people crammed into that space. I know many have said that the south concourse is bigger than the west, but I just don't see it. For reference: http://www.occc.net/pdf/mm_floorplans.pdf is the plans to the floor. The area of the south concourse that they had may have been bigger than what they had on the west, but if they were expecting the numbers they were, something went awry. Some of the logistical concerns I find: The entrances and exits (two that I could find) were small and a huuge bottleneck. On my way back, they changed the direction of one of the escalators and I almost got pushed over and trampled once at the top because people just stopped in front (that's mostly people, but there should have been more ingress/egress points or more well organized entrance and exit queues. There was a lot of unused space. A LOT. With the entire entry side, where the advance ticket booths were, the scion displays, there was enough room to fit a lot of other booths there. or better yet, the food court and some chairs. I think a lot of issue could have been helped by utilizing that big area that just ended up being a place for people to sit. I don't doubt that the area that they had in the south hall was bigger than what they had in the west hall, but I think some of the area was poorly used. Judging from the floor plans linked above, the west hall in total is far larger than the south. I think it prudent in the future to obtain a larger area in the west hall or two parts of the south/north hall. My big frame of reference is last years con and Celebration V and VI. CV and CVI had less people, yes, but they had a large area of the west hall sculpted out and it worked smoothly. yes the dealer's floors were busy, but manageable. I've heard that the numbers are about half, but even still it felt bigger and there were many large areas unused or set up for laser tag games at CVI. I know there was some Mary Kay, some dance/cheer competition, and some flooring convention going on in the west concourse. could they have been shifted to the south concourse to make more room in the west for megacon? I'm dissapointed for this year. I took a trip up from Miami, got a hotel, and am glad as I've heard that the traffic was an absolute nightmare. It was my Gf's first year there and she's not sure she wants to go back. I heard from other first-year-ers that they don't want to go back, between the traffic both getting to and inside the convention. It just seemed poorly planned this year. I know that there are only three people running it, but maybe it's time to start adding some more to help out. Especially since this year's attendance was 75-80k. At least 10k, possibly closer to 15k more than last year. That's a big jump and I think it just couldn't be handled.Anyway, sorry rant over. Just wanted to say my piece and see what y'all thought.TL;DR: Not sure I'm coming back next year unless I know the floor space is bigger and more well organized.Edit: I just did the math with the above floor plans. If Megacon only had halls A&amp;B in the west concourse, then south is bigger by about 120,000 sqft. However, if they were able to secure halls C and D, the space would expand to a little over 900,000sqft. (about 250,000 more sqft. give or take) It seems like the solution comes down to limiting the number of people in the dealer's hall at once, or utilizing the space better, or just getting more space.
22gj0k	-21735	1396905010	MechanicalKeyboards	[modification][help] Swapability of the KBT Race, Noppoo Choc Mini, or Keycool 84?	Hello again /r/mechanical keyboards!I'm into planning mode in my head with what I want to do once I get up some money or trade away some of my classic boards. Does anyone have the experience with swapping keys from a board to any of the three listed above? Basically, I want a roughly 84 key board with MX Greens. From what I've been able to deduce, this is best achieved by getting as inexpensive a mx green board as I can, probably the QFR, and swapping those switches out onto the Race, Choc Mini, or Keycool. Anyone have any experience with swapping these keys out? As for the 84 key boards, I'm leaning more towards the Choc Mini or the Keycool. I don't know if either one is easier to swap to/from or if it's board or plate mounted. Key customization will be a factor here too, so that might push my hand one way or the other.Any input helps! And of course once I get things and get down and dirty, I'll post pics, but that's probably not for a few months.
28ojc3	-21735	1403305294	rollerblading	[question] I have some odd, not very common skates and am looking to sell them and have no idea for pricing or what to expect. They are Mojo Strap-on Skates.	As the title says, I have the pair of strap-on skates. They look like they come from the 90's, maybe early 2000's. I have seen some things about them online, but pictures and anything other than someone making a reference to them, I don't hear much. They are designed in such a way that you wear a normal shoe and strap yourself in. They are okay for skating in, but aren't amazing.Does anyone know what these usually go for in price? I can't find anyone selling them online, especially since "Mojo skates" now gives results about a Landroller skate. I could slap any price on them, but I want them to sell, so I was wondering if anyone here knew what they went for originally or what they go for. Thanks.Edit: http://imgur.com/a/nUPbE Album of potato quality pictures. (phone is all I have access to camera wise at the moment)

2eakrz	-21735	1408727853	Trackballs	Hey fellow Ballers!	Hi all,I've been balling for about 6-7 years now, and I have only recently gone back to regular mouse for certain FPS games. It's not because I find the experience with trackballs inferior, it's cause I get twitchy and sometimes jitter the ball with my hand and cause my own accuracy to go down. I'm using an old mouse for that and I'm still not sure if I'm going to keep doing that. And now for my list of mice I use. Apparently I had some good luck finding now discontinued products for cheap. At home, my current model is the Cordless optical trackman, which I was able to get as a gift one year for my birthday right as they were going out of production. At work I use a Microsoft D67-00001. At home I have a few that I'm not using and might be wanting to sell soon. They are a Logitech Marble (great mouse, just needs a scroll whell, IMO), a wired trackman wheel, a microsoft explorer, and an old CST with serial connections and no scroll wheel. All are working and have only minor wear from use (labels are faded or worn off, etc.) I'm the type that knows that trackballs are more rare, so I grab them when I see them. This is how I came across the explorer for far less than they are going for. In any case, just wanted to introduce myself and say hi. Glad to see /u/ripster55 in another subreddit. :D I could go on to list my mechanicals, but not here. 
2euslt	-21735	1409257674	MechanicalKeyboards	[help] Desgining a custom keyboard with ALPS switches.	Hello all,Over the past 6-8 months, possibly longer, I've been toying with the idea of doing a custom 60% (or less, probably less) layout with some white ALPS switches from a board I had that was a donor board for another. It donated two switches and was a full layout, so I should have 100+ switches left to play with. I'd like to do something in the 84 key range, preferrably with arrow keys. I'd have to get creative with a few of the key placements, but I think it can work. Now, my initial questions are these: Does there exist somewhere a detailed description of the plate holes needed for the switches? I've seen some people showing a custom layout maker on here for keys, I think that would be a great start, and can incorporate the keys I do have from extra sets into the design. Can anyone point me to that? I've seen many people making their own boards and most use a teensy. Are there basic plug and play firmwares that I can use as a base and define my own function layer? I've done plenty of soldering, and that doesn't scare me, I'll probably do a hand-wired design instead of PCB, but are there good guides out there for hand-wiring? A lot of what I have found feels like it used to with some of the Linux stuff where asking simple questions or being unable to make the leap from step A to B to C meant that you were a noob and couldn't handle yourself in the big world with the old-timers. I would like to create a comprehensive guide upon completeing the board to help out anyone else in my current situation in the future, based around my creation. Thank you all for reading, this sub is great, I hope that it continues being positive.  Perhaps we could even start a sub or a few sidebar/wiki posts about creating your own board.
2f0sst	-21735	1409422427	ukulele	[Help] Some issues with my DIY Altoids Uke	Hello all,I have a few questions regarding my uke I've created. I actually started the project a while ago, but between work, moving, and a few other things I haven't been able to revisit it much.I have th uke built, I did the fretboard myself, and aside from a few frets, it seems to be alright. My question/problem is this: I'm getting a lot of twang (not the good kind) from the A string, and a bit from the E string. If I have the first fret pressed down on both, I get great sound. If not, twang and vibrations that I don't want. I think it might be that there isn't enough tension on the first fretwire/nut (Instead of a nut, I used fretwire), but I've tried temporary solutions to no avail. I'm worried to do any more work on the head, but I suspect there needs to be less material and more tension on the strings before it hits the first fretwire/nut. Can anyone confirm/dent that this is true? Edit: the uke in question: http://imgur.com/RqZyc6s http://imgur.com/UmVv4BV http://imgur.com/f6KMcZt

It's a terminal based board, meaning it's got a 4-pin RJ11socket and cable. The only references I can find to this model are a short listing on the deskthority wiki which suggests ADB connections.

It has some dirt on it, but that can be easily cleaned off. Asking $50 plus shipping OBOThe next is an older version of the Big Keys Plus from Greystone Digital. It has white alps switches, not sure if complicated or not, but they are clicky. The layout is... interesting, but not insurmountable. Good board in good working order, I'll ship with the DIN 5-pin (AT) to PS/2 converter. Comes in original box, and is fairly clean. Asking $50 plus shipping OBO.

2wzxnb	-21735	1424792516	Nexus7	2012 model weak wifi fix?	Hello all,I got a 2012 32 Gb model a few months ago, and I love it so far except for one thing. The wifi signal is always weak compared to every other device I own. I can have my phone or laptop in the same area displaying 80-100% signal and the nexus has at most 40-50%. For reference, it is a factory refurb, and apart from some scratching on the nex7 power supply, there's been nothing else wrong with it. I haven't taken the back cover off yet, but I remember seeing some sort of reference to there being a poor connection there that can be fixed to improve wifi connectivity. All I can find on youtube is people with shite camera focus "fixing" the issues or someone completely modifying the back cover to include different antenna styles. Interesting concept, but I don't need to be able to get wifi from 100 feet away, I just want to have solid connections in my room and the bathroom. Now, from what I've seen, there are two prongs that stick up from the motherboard side of the nexus and connect to pads on the back cover. Is this what needs to be adjusted or modified? Has anyone else done this? Is it a more permanent solution or will it work for 6 months and have to be done again? If it's not a long-lasting win, is there a better way without making major changes to the cover? I have checked the sidebar and apart from the 2013 teardown video, can't find anything else regarding this issue. I've seen a few people mention it, and I remember someone saying that it can be fixed after taking the cover off, but I can't seem to find that now. TL;DR: Wifi Sucks, should I take off back cover and fiddle?
38uk4a	-21735	1433632563	MechanicalKeyboards	[Interest Check] A friend and I are creating small gamepad keyboards. Looking for input and interest.	So a friend and I have decided to start making gaming keypads. I have a small album of what the current version looks like. it is here: http://imgur.com/a/SQl37 I've been using it for Borderlands 2, Borderlands: the Pre-Sequel, Quake II, and a few other games I play. We plan on having them available in any currently-manufactured Cherry MX switch. I'm looking for some feedback and suggestions as well as to see if anyone's interested. We have not come up with a final design or price as of yet. We are using the teensy 3.0 currently and plan on adding LED options. After playing with it, I think that we need some wider keys below the rest to act as keys like space and shift. The case is just something I made to fit it in and see where I wanted to go with that. What do you all think? Thanks /r/mk

I mean maybe it's just because I don't follow the sport as closely as some, but Rooney hasn't looked that good ever since the 2010 World Cup.  Heck, he got *pulled* in the World Cup.  I think it would be another Torres situation, imo.
1ki7ow	-21740	1376680309	movies	A Scene in A Movie	Pick a scene from a movie, any movie, one watched by many would help.  Explain why that scene stands out for you.  It doesn't need to be the best scene in the movie or even your favorite scene.  Just post why you think it's interesting from *any* point of view.  I'll start:The scene in The Godfather, where they're sitting around waiting to find out where the meeting with Solazzo will be.  One of my most interesting scenes for several reasons: 1) it's an intense scene; Michael's in pain unable to eat, Tom is pacing.  2) They're eating.  Again!  They eat so often in the Godfather movies.  3) They're eating Chinese food; I'm assuming because all the women-folk were shoo'd away.  It also looks like the table is set up in the hallway next to the steps for some reason. 4) Who is that guy sitting next to Clemenza?  Does he have a name?  Is he even in any other scene in the movie??  5) I love how Clemenza talks to Michael, instructing him about the hit.  Also, his fingers look dirty, like he's one of those guys who's always a little grungy.  Finally) the shot of Sonny going down the hallway to answer the phone.  It's all one take: everyone in the audience and on the screen are watching him intently, like the man with the black mask when he walks up to the prisoner on the gallows.

1mh5vz	-21740	1379301024	Terminator	Just re-watched Terminator3	I thought this movie missed in so many ways.  I thought the script was sort of slap-dash and the acting missed a lot, too.  It spent far too much time referring the previous movies, too.  For instance, the sunglasses, "hasta las vista" etc.But I realized where it really fell down on the job.  The scene after they escape Kristina Lokken and after they pick up snacks in the desert 7-11, John tries to explain to Kate what the deal is.  After thinking for years that they had warded off Judgement Day, John doesn't seem too affected one way or the other about having to go through with the apocalypse(!) after all.  And the speech Nick Stahl gives is flat and uninteresting.  I thought this scene had the potential of being really emotionally powerful, life changing (since it technically is) but it just sort of laid there like someone dropped a sock.Anyway, imo.

1yb2xr	-21740	1392780011	funny	You Think You've Got Problems	You guys complain about your living situations, they're nothing compared to mine.  Due to conditions beyond my control, I'm stuck living with six other people.  Six!  We're stuck in these crude rooms, with hardly any kitchen or bathroom facilities. We're literally living hand to mouth.And let me explain these people to you. First of all, there's this arrogant rich guy.  Well, he *claims* to be rich, but I haven't seen any of it. He says all his money is "overseas."  It's like living with a mythical nigerian price.  The problem is that he's so arrogant.  He acts all high and mighty, won't help with any chores, and looks down his nose at everyone.  Everyone except his wife of course. She can do no wrong.  She's actually not too bad, but she's really snooty too. She spends half her time, though, nagging him about not enjoying the finer things in life that his money supposedly should give them.  Really self-entitled.And then there's these two girls.  Oh my god, they are *so* gorgeous; they share a room and you swear the two of them are up to something, but none of us have any proof.  They act really stuck up and aloof, unless they want something from you: then it's all eye-lash batting and flirting.  They do some of the cooking at least, so I guess that's okay, but you don't dare ask them out or try to get closer. One's an innocent country girl and the other one claims to have been a model. She *is* really hot, but I've never seen any of her so-called pictures or anything.  She's also really a bitch sometimes.  It really grates on me.Then there's this loner; he hardly ever talks to any of us and he's always up to something.  He's got all this weird home made experiments running in there, there's weird smells coming, and when he tries to explain what he's doing we can't make any sense out of it.  What's really infuriating though, is that he keeps saying we should do all the other work around here, the cooking and cleaning and everything, because he's always "working" on some plan that will get us all out of this jam.  He keeps saying it, but we're still here, so draw your own conclusions.But the worst is my roomate.  He's my best friend, and we've been through a lot; he even saved my life a few years ago when I got into a really tight jam.  I mean, seriously, it's no exageration to say he saved my life.  I owe him a lot, but god...he is so *dumb.*  I mean, there's nothing this can can't screw up.  I'm constantly berating him, and encourgaing him, and yelling at him, but he literally won't listen.  Every single time one of us comes up with a way to get out of this mess we've found ourselves in, he screws it up.  I mean, he's a really sweet guy, without a mean bone in his body, but he's more trouble than he's worth.So that's my life.  I'm stuck here and I really see no way of getting out of this.  We've been like this for years and it seems like we'll be here for decades to come.And to think this all started with a three-hour tour.

Rust and Marty were in the Well of Souls (or whatever it's called) and couldn't get any cell phone service.-What did the Hart girls use for tampons if Marty was off shagging that Beth girl?-When does the soundtrack go on sale?

28nf4i	-21740	1403280242	worldcup	US Fans: ESPN's world cup coverage:	Over-all I think it's been pretty good.  In high-def the broadcasts look great.  The camera work has been just fine.  However, the studio parts have been really sub-par.  Bob Ley is okay, but Alexie Lalas is banal, and the other commentators don't seem to have a good grasp of the English language.  Which is fine; except for the fact they're on an English language broadcast. :)One of the good things, imo, is the lack of the human interest stories.  Since there's no stoppages in play, we don't have to get "up close and personal" with the athletes and learn about their grandma's hip bone surgery or whatever tripe they come up with.And as always, Ian Darke might be the best in the business, not just football but all sports.Addendum: when they do the player intros, why do they have them all turning to the camera and then folding their arms?  That's so weak...:)

One of my nephews has pointed out that a short story written by Isaac Asimov in the 1950s is about people building a giant computer to answer all of life's questions.  SPOILER ALERT!! The computer eventually needs so much data it ends up in hyperspace and when it gets done calculating, there it no one there to hear the answer, the computer shouts the answer out loud: Let there be light!The computer is without form ans is only a voice.  Could the writers have this in mind when they came up with "God" in the episode Godfellas? where the galaxy cluster talks to Bender in binary?

Alzheimer's is a horrible disease and as onlookers of its effects, we assume that the victims must suffer to live like this. However, are they aware of what is going on? If there weren't people to constantly bring up that they were forgetting their past, would they live by "ignorance is bliss"? Or do most Alzheimer's patients feel depressed because they are somewhat aware of what is happening to them? We have our own assumptions but how is it through their eyes?

2biv10	-21771	1406143539	tifu	TIFU by making my husband gargle my son's piss	My husband, son, and I were driving down to Florida for our family vacation. My husband and I had taken turns driving but for the last several hours he was the one driving. As many of you know, being on the road that long really messes with your mind and since we were in the final stretch of our road trip, we were both pretty brain dead. There was about 3 hours left and we had left the rest stop about two hours ago. This was when my 5 year old son started whining that he needed to go to the bathroom. At this point I just wanted to get there already and not make another stop before we did. Instead of making a stop, I grabbed the nearest container and told my son to pee in it. The bottle that just so happened to be by the shotgun seat was a Listerine mouthwash bottle. My son did his business in it and I put it back where I took it from. After that I dozed off for a little while until we were nearing the hotel. When I woke up I completely forgot about what happened to the bottle and my husband had not even been aware of the pee transaction from earlier. After a long ride our breaths were kind of unpleasant so my husband asked me for the mouthwash. I handed it to him and neither of us noticed the blue mouthwash had a greenish hue.Well my husband took big ol a swig of the gross mixture and after swishing it around in his mouth, he suddenly had a quizzical look on his face. That is when I realized...oh shit. I told him and he pretty much retched the mouthwash/piss out. I do feel really bad but looks like the mouthwash didn't do much washing after all. TL;DR: I gave my son the mouthwash bottle to urinate in, I forgot and handed the pissy mouthwash to husband, husband gargles son's piss. PS. Good thing you don't swallow mouthwash

But I'm pretty sure when a quarterback rips his helmet off and starts throwing a tantrum (twice) that some sort of flag should be thrown. Especially when one of those times was followed by yelling in a ref's face. Calm yourself, RG3, it's just football.There was also quite a few missed calls in the fourth quarter. We had the entire stadium booing for a good few minutes.

We did football last fall, and currently have basketball and hockey leagues going on now. Let me know if you're interested!
r7exd	-21791	1332367981	CFB	Introduction to Big 12 fans for TCU and WVU	I know this has been done before but what the hell. It's a Wednesday and I'm bored.* **Texas:** They think they own the Big 12. Financially, they probably do. They have had two off seasons but still get better recruits than you ever will. The fans are (for the most part) respectful and take great pride in their program and tradition. Austin is the greatest city on Earth. * **Texas Tech:** Gross. I think WVU fans will get along with them just fine. Lubbock is a dirty city. Beware the Raider Rash. They had a great program under Leach, but Tuberville will never get it back to that point. The color scheme is the coolest in the Big 12.* **Baylor:** Will never let you forget about RG3 and their miraculous success in every sport this past season. Waco is terrible. Floyd Casey Stadium is terrible. However, if their proposed new stadium design gets built, they may have one of the best stadiums in the Big 12. Fucking sailgating, man.* **Oklahoma State:** Like Baylor, they will never let you forget about this past season. Unlike Baylor, no Oklahoma State fan will ever agree that RG3 was the best QB in the league. Boone Pickens might as well be their Athletic Director, he makes all the decisions. Oklahoma State fans claim to hate OU fans, but secretly just want OU fans to pay as much attention to them as they do Texas. Stillwater sucks except for Eskimo Joe's.* **Oklahoma:** About on par with Alabama for bandwagon fans. The educated fans are actually decent, classy people, but the bandwagoners ruin their image. So concerned with the Red River Rivalry, they don't pay any attention to the other 10 rivalries they have going on. More proud of their past successes than their present. Always pre-season ranked way too high. Norman is an *okay* city.* **Kansas State:** Bill Snyder is magic. I've never been to Manhattan, but haven't heard anything bad. Their fans travel surprisingly well. Very respectful, too.* **Kansas:** Basketball school.* **Iowa State:** Rabid little fuckers. The fans keep quiet when they should, but have a TON of pride for their school. I can respect that. Paul Rhoads is awesome. Minus academics, they are kind of the Vandy of the Big 12. Everybody would secretly love for Iowa State to do well. Oklahoma State fans have a subconscious hatred for this school. Ames is fucking cold.

Of course my phone was blowing up all day with texts and Facebook posts, but nobody at the office was aware it was my birthday (why keep track for a 3-month intern?) and coming home to my lonely apartment is just not the same as coming home to a family of smiling faces.Let it be known that money is not a problem. This is, in fact, a very well-paying internship. I can very easily afford my own pizza (and will probably do just that if this post doesn't get any traffic). Just seeing if anybody is in the giving mood!Here's [proof](http://i.imgur.com/H7faz.png) that today is my birthday. I would hate to be anything but honest to this amazing community.

I have three semesters left of college - If I could end up saving money in the long run by buying an iPad and ebooks, I would do so in a heartbeat. I'm just curious if anybody else has had any success in using an iPad for college textbooks. The textbooks I will be needing are all for upper-level industrial engineering courses.I just have this dream of having all of my books, notes, and other class material with my at all times on an iPad, and have all of that sync onto my iPhone and MacBook via iCloud.Thanks!

That being said, I still regard my Eagle Scout award as my post proud life achievement. I have had it on my resume since I wrote my first resume and I planned on keeping it on there for life.That being said, in light of recent coverage of the BSA's stance, would it even be a smart idea to advertize that I am a recipient of the BSA's highest honor? Many companies nowadays have very strict equality in the workplace ideals (which they should) and I could see somebody assuming that since I am an Eagle Scout, I agree with the BSA's bigotry. I was never taught to hate in the Boy Scouts and the skills I learned were lifechanging, but I would hate for a misconception to be had.

znvza	-21791	1347300171	YELLOWLEAGUE	Conference changing options?	Since we're down to 6 players, this league is much more manageable. During this offseason, we can switch around the conferences if you guys like. Assuming we stick with out current teams, we have a few different options. We could:A) All join one conference. This would allow us to play each other every season. This may be a hassle though, since scheduling user games can be hard.B) This is my favorite idea. Since we have 2 Big 12, 2 Big 10 and 2 MWC, we could alter the conferences to make each have 12 members and each user player in his own division. We could also set up a protected rivalry between the users in the same conference, that way they would play each other each season, and could potentially have a rematch in the conference championship. We could also either give the MWC an automatic bid, or move Hawaii and Boise to a conference that has one.C) Keep everything the same.I really like option B. This allows us to run our divisions while competing with one other person for the conference. Then we can potentially all meet up in the bowl season if we have a good season. Thoughts?

(you don't even have to turn on your xbox, just go to http://www.easports.com/dynasty/ to take care of it)Also I was thinking about the conference structures. Here's what I was thinking:**Big East:** I will create the new Big East so Louisville and Boise can be in a conference together, but I'll put them in separate divisions with a protected rivalry.**Big 12:** I will add Colorado and Mizzou back in to bring the number back up to 12, WVU will take Nebraska's old spot in the North, TCU will take A&amp;M's old spot in the South, and K-State and Oklahoma State will have a protected rivalry.**Pac-12:** I will have Cal replace Colorado's spot in the South and bring in Nebraska to play in the North. Nebraska and USC will have a protected rivalry.Anybody like this idea? Any suggestions for a better idea?

Here's the two rivalries for the past three years:###Bedlam|Year|Site|Winning Team|Losing Team|Score||:--|:--|:--|:--|:--||2010|Stillwater|Oklahoma|Oklahoma State|47-41||2011|Stillwater|Oklahoma State|Oklahoma|44-10||2012|Norman|Oklahoma|Oklahoma State|51-48 OT|###Red River Rivalry|Year|Site|Winning Team|Losing Team|Score||:--|:--|:--|:--|:--||2010|Dallas|Oklahoma|Texas|28-20||2011|Dallas|Oklahoma|Texas|55-17||2012|Dallas|Oklahoma|Texas|63-21|In Oklahoma State's rebuilding year, they lead you most of the game and take you into overtime. In Texas's year of supposedly "SEC-like defense" they allow 63 points in one of the most one-sided games I've seen. Oklahoma State hasn't lost by more than 6 points these past three years, Texas's BEST loss was by 8 points.I know everybody is going to bring up history, tradition, blah blah. Sure, there's not much history in Stillwater, but I think the team and the coaching staff has proved that Oklahoma State will be a force to be reckoned with in the years to come."Okie Lite" doesn't bother me, and I can even stand to be called "Little Brother." All I want is for Bedlam to be worth more to you than "just another game."

I discovered this subreddit about a week ago at home over Christmas break and after doing the appropriate research I decided that I would like to start the process when I got back to college. Well, today is day 1 of the semester and I have no idea where to start. I've never tracked what I eat before and have always just ate what sounds good. On top of that, I don't have time to carefully and meticulously plan out exact carb and protein counts for each meal. I'm in 18 hours of class and work 20 hours per week.I guess what I'm asking is this: Are there any simple recipes that are convenient for a busy schedule? I'm on campus at lunchtime everyday, any sort of sack lunches that I could fix that are keto-friendly? Most days I have time to cook dinner, but even there I have no experience outside of my microwave and George Foreman grill. I just feel like this is a huge undertaking that I'm not prepared for, looking for a bit of help.Thanks!tl;dr: Schedule is tight, budget is reasonable. Looking for tips to start keto for a college student with no cooking experience.

Are they 100% accurate to what a player's speed rating is going to be? 40 times never change after scouting, but the skill ratings do. Here's my questions:* Is it possible for somebody with a sub-4.4 time to be a bust and sink back to a B speed?* Is a sub-4.4 time with a B speed rating a for sure sign that the rating will improve to the 90's? * Do 40 times have any affect on acceleration?* Are the ratings so consistent that you can tell the exact rating a player's speed will be just by reading the 40 time?Thanks for any insight! If anybody knows anything about bench press and squat levels, feel free to talk about those too!

Our introductory meeting is this Sunday at 9 PM in the Student Union Atrium. We will be discussing what we do as well as expectations for new and returning members. This meeting has no expectations attached to it, it's simply to inform everybody of how the club is going to be run this year so people can see and hear before they commit to joining.

In-state rivals all over the country battled it out on Saturday and OU and OSU got a third bye week. Bedlam should have been played during week 14. Week 15, in my opinion, should be reserved for only conference championship games, regardless if the conference has a championship game or not.Just my two cents. I hate watching every other big in-state rivalry in the country duke it out, then have to wait a week to play against ours.

I opted for the 1-month free trial (which is still active) and set up an account through the Xbox. Well, now I'm having buyers remorse seeing that they offer a $50 value promotion for signing up (Roku stick) as opposed to my $20 value promotion (1 free month). Any way to get this promotion on an existing account? I would gladly pay 3 months in advance for a free Roku stick.EDIT: I called customer support, apparently since I'm already on the Xbox promotion, they can't add the Roku promotion on top of that. Thanks for your help everybody!
2zvvti	-21797	1427008195	misophonia	{TRIGGER WARNING} I have suffered from this my whole life and never knew what to call it. Im tearing up knowing that Im not crazy. Just a long rant.	Ever since I was a kid I used to get skeeved out by the sound of people chewing with their mouths open. My father ate like this so I wouldnt eat with him. We grew as a family who brought our dinners to seperate places in the house.My mom would also chew like this and I would ask her "Can you please stop chewing like that?" Her being the douche she can sometimes be, used to do it even louder, or more exaggerated just to annoy me. It would be so bad sometimes I would literally cry. So now here is where Im truly suffering : i moved in with my boyfriend and he has two dogs. One of them is a bulldog. One is a boy and one is a girl. Both are not fixed. Wheres the problem you ask? Let me tell you.First off the bulldog is constantly licking. Licking his nose for no reason at all. Just licks and slobbers. Ive kind of learned to deal with it cuz cmon theyre dogs, they cant help it. But once it starts to get a bit much i have to push his head. Just a little shove and say "enough." I feel bad and i dont do it in front of my bf but i really cant help it. I get goosebumps just thinking about it.The worst of it is when the female gets her period. It lasts for about three weeks And the male will NOT LEAVE HER ALONE. I loathe these times. Im on constantly alert because i can hear him do it anywhere at any time. Him lapping at her vaginA, sniffing and snorting as he does it. Then hell proceed to hump her and make weird licking and snorting sounds. It is so fucking bad that i can be in the deepest sleep at About lets say 2:17 am and i will bolt right up to him doing it. I catch him everytime and will scream st the top of my lungs "DIESEL!!!!!!" Ive woken my bf up plenty of times doing this. Im on constant watch during this time of the month. It makes me absolutely loathe these dogs. I've cried to my bf, begged him to keep them seperate, begged him to get her fixed, do something because it drives me fucking INSANE. He doesnt get it.Hell sit there and let the dog just lick him for literally a half hr maybe a whole hour if I dont say Okay thats enough!!!!!!Anyone else like this with dogs? Thanks so much for taking the time out to read this. I never knew there was a definition for this feeling. I always thought i was being a little crazy. I am so relieved to know this exists and i cant wait to shove it in my bfs face haha.
33vwa6	-21797	1430018402	childfree	It grosses me out. (Rant)	Im 24 years old, living in Nyc. And i just need to rant.I used to hang out with lots of kids, doing teenager shit. Drinking, drugs, partying, hanging out. And I thought being in my early 20s id be able to do all of that (more responsibly) with my group of friends i used to have.But now, literally EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY FRIENDS have one or more children. It disgusts me a little. Some of my friends are my age with 7(!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) kids!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No lie! Every day theres a new sonogram pictue on instagram or facebook and I have to supress the urge to say "wow im sorry." Alot of my friends have this mentality that they want tk have children young (20 years old wtf) so they wont be too old when the kid grows up. Is that a valid reason? I truly dont think so. I actually think its incredibly selfish. I mean i know some of these people that are working in SUBWAYS with a newborn child just because.I find it really hard to believe nobody uses protection nowAdays. I just cant put into words how weird i feel about this subject. To put in perspective of the way i see it : me and my sister had a group of really close friends. 3 sisters and their brother, and their cousin. Um one sister has 3 children, another has 2 and another has one. Their brother has a child and their cousin has a child and my sister has a child. They are all within my age range!!!!Like i know we all grow up sometimes but since when was having multiple children considered "growing up"? I think its stupid, pointless and sad.All of my friends have further pushed me to not wanting children - ever!!! Thanks guys!And thats the end of my rant. Sorry if its silly or doesnt make sense. Ive felt this way for a while and it feels really good to get off my chest.

3aa4rg	-21797	1434632546	childfree	I don't want kids because my parents made me raise my sister. How bout you?	My parents decided to have a kid when I was ten years old. And for the last ten years all I remember is raising her. Waking up in the middle of the night to feed her, having to babysit her for YEARS. I wasn't allowed to go out because I was stuck babysitting her. It was so bad I would have to go to school late because I ha to get up, get her ready for school and drop her off. I couldn't stay late after school because I had to pick her up. Weekends were non existent. If I had a party or wanted to hang out with friends I had to make sure I wasn't on babysitting duty (which I was.) I would have to beg my mother to please come home so I could make it out to whatever I planned. During the summer while my mom wasn't working she FORCed me to bring my younger sister I the park everyday. And if I brought her home too early I had to go back. I could honestly go on and on but raising my sister was very traumatic for me. It's the exact reason why I don't want children of my own. But nobody understands this. Not my mom, sisters or even boyfriend. "That was your sister. Your own kid is different." UM HOW???Sorry for the rant just needed to get it off my chest. Do you have any underlying reason?

One who has a bigger more pronounced labia and one whos are more tucked. More like the "porno ideal" vaginas. And it says "There's Two Types ofWomen." THESE FUCKING PICTURES INFURIATE ME AND MY BOYFRIEND DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHY.I showed him the picture and he said yeah "One's a slut and ones a virgin." That's what the picture means to him. So I went off on him. I flipped out, had to explain why that way of thinking is disgusting etc. And he just doesn't get it. He says "That's his opinion and that's it." And he doesn't understand why I'm offended. I'm kind of disgusted I date someone like this right now. I just needed to vent because I've dealt with this a few times. Where did men come up with this theory? Why do they still hold on to it? What can I say to my bf to hopefully change his mind?EDIT- i apologiz for my origina edit!

Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks :)
3ejewg	-21797	1437808134	homeless	My love, two dogs and I are newly homeless in Nyc!	*update* So we just went through our first official night of living out of our car! We woke up early, got his brother to babysit the dogs for a bit and got us a storage space so we would have room in the car. Suchhhh a good idea!!!!!!!!! After that i luckily still had my library card on me so we went to the library where i speed emailed all sorts of jobs my resume. I even contacted my previous job i left to move to Nj. I didnt leave on bad terms so i thought it was worth a shot. Due to a helpful comment with a cheap place for rent in Jersey City my bf started looking for places in Jersey for rent. Found a potential studio for about 650$ and contacted the realtor. We should be going to check out a few places tomorrow. He said he had a lot of places that were pet friendly! So were hoping his uncle might be able to lend us some cash for a down payment but its not certain. Sleeping wasnt so bad. We got better shade and wthout the extra bags its much more comfy. A car pulled up behind us last night and stood there and we were so spooked it was cops that we stopped everything we were doing and just went to sleep. We woke up today to see a couple sleeping in the car! Whats the irony in that? Lol! Were seeing it as a bit of a journey. His father kicked us out today due to the fact his fathers gf was uncomfortable with us and the dogs living in his dads house (that she doesnt own and she has her own apartment). Her son left a literal shit stain on the toilet bowl and seat and we asked dad to talk to her son. They got offended and the boy said i was giving him mean looks so his dad said we had to go!Anyway were trying to be positive and see it as an adventure. We have a truck that were staying out of and we plan on getting a storage spot tomorrow along with a gym membership. Luckily since my bf broke his back in a serious injury two years ago he gets paid from workers comp. i plan on immediately searching for jobs. Night one has been pretty difficult so far. We have a bulldog and its pretty hot so we had to search around at 1 am for portable fans. The first one we got sidnt work and we have about 8 diff bags in the car so its been hard adjusting in the car. We found two small battery powered fans though and they work ok so hopefully our bully will live another day.Were trying to keep positive and hope for only good things in our future. We also want to document our journey until we find an apartment so this is why i oosted this. Please give us good vibes :) also if you know if any nyc jobs for me (24 yr old female) or apartments (studio or 1 bdrm) under 1200 that will take 2 ppl and 2 dogs please let us know! Thanks and good luck to you all!

Whether its going to brooklyn or manhatten. Having it only go so many stops in brooklyn in last years brutal winter and having us wait in the freezing cold for another one to take s 8 stops, or for it just not having any manhatten service and having me take it two stops back to go forward. Its absolutely infuriating. To start off making it on time to work to being extremely fucking late. What is going on here? I literally started screaming just now seeing there was no manhatten service till 5 pm. WHY!!! Why! I need fucking answers. I cant be paying almost 3 dollars back and forth everyday to not have reliable service. At least the buses have been vetter. But for us to have the biggest and most complex train system it sure is shitty as fuck and is probably the worst thing about nyc.Thanks for letting me rant 🔫🔫
3hmmsf	-21797	1440015166	Advice	The day we were supposed to move in to our apartment we found roaches. Can we break the lease and get all of our money back?	So pretty much it goes like this. Everything was well and good. We checked everything, didn't see any signs of bugs at first. So we signed a year lease, and gave a deposit and 1 month's rent. The apartment still needed work and we agreed to move in on the 15th. The day comes to move in and well, the place STILL wasn't done. The super said he hurt his back trying to fix the place, so he couldn't finish the bathroom. Then I go into the kitchen and I see a bowl of half eaten food sitting on the counter with a bunch of roaches surrounding it. My bf said he noticed that last week he was there the super was eating that food. So they ate, shellaced the floor and left the bowl there for about a week. I flipped out. I've lived in a place with both roaches and bed bugs when I was younger and I absolutely refuse to do it again. We tell the landlord. He said he'll call management and see whats up with the exterminator. And for now he has 1 bomb. So we go back to the apartment and I see a huge roach scurrying up the bedroom wall. I break down. I can't have roaches. Not in my kitchen, not in my room not anywhere. So we leave without dropping off any of our stuff.We texted the super asking if they've ever had any issues with bedbugs and he never answered. Which worries me because the apartment building isn't all that great. We should've known better, but when we went to the apartment we didn't see anything. And we visited it about 5 times after giving 1st months rent.So on top of it not being done, it has roaches and I wouldn't put past the possibility of the building having bedbugs. We called the building owner and talked about changing our lease from Sept 1st, and about the bugs. He said he was on it.But now we're thinking we don't want to live there at all. So is it possible for us to just not fix the lease for sept 1st and ask for our money back?Thanks for the help!
2iabqh	-21798	1412441036	Music	Any advice for writing a song?	Hi. I have a relationship with this one girl who I think is perfect for me. She IS my girlfriend, but sometimes, she can be a little distant. I really am in love with her and I don't want to lose her. So, I've decided a song would be a nice solution. I told her I was writing a song for her and she got teary eyed. I really want to do this, but I've never written a song in my life. I play guitar, but I'm not the best. I barely started in January of this year to tell you the truth. So, reddit, I need advice. Important things I should know, tips, anything from fellow song writers. Thanks for clicking.

I wish clear skin to you all! :D Also, not sure if this helps, but I'm a 15 year old male. Thanks again.Other Edit: Hmmm... details? Okay, my acne really isn't as bad as other people. Most of it comes out on my forehead, below my sideburns, on my top lip, sometimes a single pimple on the middle of my cheek, around my nose, and occasionally on/around my eyebrows. I'm not saying I have all this acne right now, but these are usually the places I'm most likely to get breakouts. Yes lol I'm well aware that this is incorporated to my teenaged years, but some kids at my high school have such clear skin regardless. It may go as deep as genetics, but I don't want to get into that. I just want to see what has worked for other people so I can experiment and improvise every which way. Other Other Edit: Wow, that might be it. I drink, like, three glasses of milk a day. (^ _ ^ ;) Okay, put into consideration. See a derm, drink less milk, wash pillows &amp; pillow cases, use a towel when I sleep. Got it. Thank you all. :)

I know that with an IRA you are able to take money out penalty free as a first time home buyer. That doesn't seem to be the case with the 401k, I guess you can take out a loan against the account but increasing debt to income doesn't seem like a good plan for getting a good mortgage rate. Since I still have my IRA I was wondering if at some point I would be able to transfer my 401k to my IRA and then use the money for a home purchase? Any help would be great.

I don't mean just the food, but literally his entire lunch. He would eat the paper bag, plastic bags, juice boxes, and whatever else his mom put in his bag that day. I don't know if his mom didn't care enough to tell the school to stop him from eating everything, but he told me that he would need to go into the hospital every few weeks so they could empty his stomach.

cmcx0	-21846	1278391972	Guitar	Looking to buy (and learn to play) my first acoustic guitar. What's some advice you can give?	I have been wanting to start learning to play the guitar for a while, and now I'm finally following up on it! I need some advice before I start however.**What is a good acoustic guitar for a beginner?**I have found some links about guitars for novices, and I would most likely end up picking a well known brand (Yamaha, Epiphone, Ibanez, etc.) that can offer a decently priced guitar. I have also found many "starter kits" that include a strap, tuner, DVD/CD, book, and those kinds of things. Are these packs worth it? My price range is ~$100-150.**What are some tips on first learning to play?**Although I am totally new to playing guitar, I understand music. I played the trombone in concert/marching band for 7ish years, so I get the basics when it comes to musical form, and that a necessary part to learning anything is to PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE. I know I'm getting into all new territory here, but I like to think I have some sort of background when it comes to understanding general music knowledge. **What are some good sources to use when learning to play?**This may sound totally naive, but I'm sort of planning to teach myself with the help of the all-knowing Internet. There are so many guides, charts, blogs, tutorials, and even YouTube videos that try to teach the instrument, but I don't know if it will suffice. So do private lessons seem beneficial? The only issue with lessons would be a budget (I am college student, after all).Please post any information you have, like things you wish you knew when you were starting off playing the guitar. I'm also going to apologize in advance if these kind of questions get posted a lot, my bad! Reddit on.EDIT: 7/7 - Thank you all for the great help! I'm planning on visiting the local music store on Friday to talk to some people there. Hopefully they will be able to help me out when it comes to picking a good starter guitar. Thanks again everyone for the advice!

Some forget he's a 7 foot tall 260lber. All he needs is some training and he can become a dominant NBA center.#2 HarrisA 6'8 240 lber young forward.

1j1n5h	-21867	1374778660	atheism	These are my thoughts on why religion and the belief of an afterlife are distractions from your human experience.	When we die, that's it. Unless you believe in an afterlife. But for a moment, think about this. You die, you close your eyes for the last time, and that's it. You're no longer conscious, you just... Aren't there anymore. You get to go through the human experience once, then it's over. Isn't that a scary thought? It makes sense why one would believe in an afterlife. The thought of not existing anymore is an awful one. It leaves you feeling cold, and dreadful of the day you'll die. But the way I see it, this is just a reminder to live life to it's fullest extent. Really experience the human experience! That way, when it comes your time to exist no longer, you can look back and say "hey, I did everything I could to make your life as fulfilling as possible... And I'm proud of the life I've lived." I don't think people really understand the meaning of living life to it's fullest, and I don think you can appreciate the idea until you realize that one day, you will be gone and you will not be able to experience ***anything***. This is why I choose to not worry about religion, and to brush aside any idea of an afterlife. Because to me, those things are just a distraction from actually living your life and doing the things you ***really*** want to do.

2thl19	-21882	1422077409	NoFap	I thought I would give this a try	I have read about the "nofap challenge" before, but I never thought I could do it. On top of that I couldn't even fathom all of the benefits from doing this, so I figured what the heck I'll try. I'm on my third day and I almost relapsed but I didn't, I'm really wanting to try this and I'm so glad that there is support here on reddit.
2tisd1	-21882	1422116287	NoFap	I can't wait to experience the benefits!	I've been reading several success stories, and the benefits that people are experiencing reminded me that when I was a senior in High School, I graduated in 2005, my life was all positive. It had to be because I didn't masturbate nearly as much then as I have in later years. I remember how awesome I felt, not only because I lost a bunch of weight and got healthy, but because I wasn't addicted to masturbating. I can't wait to experience those feelings again. I'm so glad I started this!
2tjsky	-21882	1422134604	NoFap	Results may vary	I'm sure that the results will vary from person to person, but how soon did you start experiencing the benefits? Just curious
2tn8q4	-21882	1422217397	NoFap	This didn't start out like I thought it would.	I'm only on day 3 but before I started this I thought that I would have all kinds of urges to fap, I'm sure they will come later, but I haven't had any so far. I'm actually really wanting to experience the " looking at women as people" because I have developed this bad habit of when I look at any type of woman after I look at her face I immediately look down at her breasts. I guess I'm just now realizing that I shouldn't do that cause I kind of fee ashamed.
2tqtpl	-21882	1422296709	NoFap	Flatline Starting Out?	Im only 4 days into hard mode and I haven't had any urges to fap or even look at porn. Is this a flatline? Is it normal to start with one? How bad is it going to be when I get out of it? Any answers will help thanks guys! NOFAP FTW!!
2u0ddp	-21882	1422481960	NoFap	Wow it will be a week tomorrow!	Time has flown by! I honestly haven't had any urges, I think I'm still in a flat line, but I'm starting to notice that it is easier for me to get out of bed in the morning, and I'm starting to have more energy as well! This is great, I'm really excited to see what else lies in store! This community is great, I mostly stay on here, facebook, and youtube. I'll post another report when I start experiencing more benefits! Stay Strong!!!
2u41ll	-21882	1422559468	NoFap	One week and something good happened.	Ok, so I always try to stay positive so I'm going to link this to my one week of NoFap, so there is this girl I'm into at work and we talk sometimes but most of the time neither of us have time too. Well today she made a point to come and tak to me twice! I cousins believe it! I really hope that I'm starting to get that " girls notice me" superpower because my day has been made!
2u8te5	-21882	1422656249	NoFap	Today was great!	I'm 8 days in, and I can't belive how good things are going, I hope things keep getting better.First: I fought off a relapse, during the winter my eczema flairs up so it woke me up at like fifteen till 4 in the morning and I couldn't go back to sleep. So I just laid there thinking, needless to say I thought long and hard, no pun intended, about fapping but I didn't I kept telling myself "no, you've made it this far don't ruin your streak".Second: I work at an Elementary School with mostly women teachers, and they must be starting to see a change, because I noticed several of them checking me out! I of course just smiled and went on, but on the inside I was about to explode! One of the teachers is a pretty good friend of mine, lets call her "D", and she made a point several times througout today to talk to me, this isn't the girl I'm into although she did the same thing, but I don't really get to talk to "D" a lot and when I did, before I started nofap" I always felt like I was bothering her. Not any more, not only am I starting to not let things get to me, I just feel great! I don't think I have smiled this much in a long time. Hopefully things will get to the point where I can flirt with them, and they will flirt back, thats not the reason I started nofap but I was tired of always feeling dejected and anxious and all of the other symptoms that porn and accesive masturbation addiction can cause. The slow build of confidence has been great! I think I'm going to start a journal so that I can document everything! Tomorrow will be my longest streak, I tried to stop fapping years ago just out of curiosity to see how long I could go. I made it 8 days.
2u9vmd	-21882	1422677483	NoFap	Question	So ok I'll soon be on a 9 day streak of hard mode. I'm slowly building confidence and thats great because I've had none. I've noticed that girls, at least the ones I work with, are checking me out. I've always had trouble telling the difference between a girl flirting, and just being nice. But I have heard several things that you can look for, one being touch and the other eye contact, I've made sure to always try to maintain eye contact with everyone, so today I noticed that one of my friends was about to touch my arm, like in between my wrist and elbow, but she didn't...I was wondering if that ment anything or am I just reading to much into it? I made sure to touch her in that area though and she didn't seem to mind..just curious..
2uah1t	-21882	1422694178	NoFap	Just Relapsed...	Reset my badge, disappointed that I gave in but I'm not going to let it get me down...I love the "superpowers" I got, I hope I don't lose them totally. This time I'll get a star, thats my first goal.

2uhfsi	-21882	1422852276	NoFap	Damnit Janet....I want a star!	I relapsed after 8 days, I'm trying not to beat myself up too much but I really want to get a star badge. One step at a time..
2ukb5o	-21882	1422914170	NoFap	Didn't lose all of my superpower!	Ok so this past Saturday I relapsed, I had gone 8 days. Before I relapsed I noticed around day 4-5 that I just felt good, I had more energy and a better outlook on life, not to mention that I had a few girls checking me out at work! I was so afraid that after I relapsed that I would loose everything. Granted I did feel more anxious and it was a little bit more difficult to hold eye contact, but I still had a few women checking me out. One of them was still really friendly with me, so they must still see some positive change in me that they like. My longest streak ever is 8 days, I'm determined  to go longer. My first goal is to go a month and get a star! I love the way I feel while doing NoFap it's a great feeling, I can't imagine how good its going to be once I get to a month and onward! Stay strong fellow Fapstronauts!
2urfso	-21882	1423064042	NoFap	I think my badge is wrong	when do the badges update? I think mine is a day behind. 
2v9i13	-21882	1423453349	NoFap	I'm telling her how I feel..	Ok, tomorrow will break my longest streak, 9 days, and I feel great! There is a girl at work that I'm really interested in, and I think she know, so I'm going to tell her. The only thing is we don't have a lot of time to talk so I don't know when I'm going to tell her but I am. I can already start to feel my confidence rise the longer I do this. So I shall continue. I've always had trouble telling girls how I feel but I'm feeling pretty good about myself so I'll see how it goes!
2vdhf5	-21882	1423535945	NoFap	Talking louder	I don't know if this has anything to do with nofap but I have noticed that with my voice being a little deeper it seems like my voice is louder as well. Has anyone else noticed this?
2vghpl	-21882	1423601941	NoFap	Noticing a positive change.	I'm only 10 days in and I've noticed at work, I work with mostly women teachers, that they have been a lot more friendly with me and I think it has to do with NoFap. There is one teacher that I talk to frequently and I have noticed that she talks to me more and actually seems interested in what I'm doing and saying. So I guess, unbeknownst to me, people have noticed a positive change in me. This alone give me reason to keep going, it seems that things just keep getting better with the people I work with. I've always been a shy person but while doing NoFap I have noticed that I don't care as much about what people think about me, and I'm more outgoing, I have noticed that my voice has gotten a little deeper and I'm talking a little louder/clearer. Plus I'm always making eye contact with people, what I do is while I'm talking to someone I lock eyes with them, not in a creepy way, and let them be the first to look away. I love the small confidence boost I have gotten, because before I would have not made eye contact with anyone and I would have been the one that keeps looking away. I'm still trying to build up the courage to talk to the girl I'm interested in, but I'm gonna take it one day at a time. I can't wait to see what happens once I get to a month/3 months/a year. I'm so glad I decided to do this!
2vgwty	-21882	1423608440	NoFap	Wanting to be attractive.	I've struggled for a while about wanting to be attractive to the opposite sex and I have to say this small confidence boost makes me feel good. But I was wondering what other people do it I make themselves look/feel good? Right now I'm dieting and trying to stop drinking so much soda and eating healthier. Any suggestions?
2vi8pb	-21882	1423631775	NoFap	I want her..	Ok, I've been attracted to my friend since I met her, but now while doing NoFap its like I want her not sexually, I mean I would love to have sex with her, but I just want her I want to hold her and comfort her and stare into her beautiful eyes, everytime she comes near my my heart leaps...I think I may love her..
2vlmz8	-21882	1423702954	NoFap	Question.	How do you tell a girl how you feel if you don't get much time to talk throughout the day? I went and talked to her today, I don't do it often, cause I thought I had done something wrong, so I wanted to smooth things out. Luckily she wasn't mad, but she did bring up me telling the girl I'm interested in. I could have easily told her then and there, but I waisted the opportunity. I guess I could text her? I don't know. I really want to tell her, but I don't know how. 
2vnfwq	-21882	1423749094	NoFap	"There's Something Different About Him"	This is my longest streak ever, 12 days, I feel great it feels like I can do anything! My confidence is a little higher, I'm able to hold eye contact, I can express my thoughts clearer, and my voice has gotten deeper. But something that I have noticed here lately is my friends facial expression when she sees me. I've noticed that when I see her the first time during the day she is already staring at me, but I pretend not to notice. Then I have noticed a kind of puzzled look on her face while looking at me, a " there is something different about him, but I can't quite put my finger on it". That actually makes me feel awesome, knowing that she sees a change in me and that she likes it. We haven't been this close since I met her, when we first met I was overweight and I fapped all the time so my confidence was shit and I felt worthless. Well I was moved to another department so I didn't get to see her for a year and a half, but when I came back I had lost some weight but I still fapped so things weren't much different. We started to become friends when she helped me through my broken heart. But now things are completely different since starting NoFap. I'll see you at day infinity!!!
2vt5a9	-21882	1423863689	NoFap	I don't know what's going on?	I don't know if this has anything to do with NoFap or not, but since I started I have noticed a lot of positive things, I've gotten closer with a good friend of mine, people start conversations with me easier and I just have a "feel good " feeling all of the time. What I don't understand is, when I first started NoFap, not this streak I actually relapsed on day 8 of my first streak, the girl I'm interested in would make time to come and talk to me and I was able to hold good eye contact with her it was great. But since I relapsed things are different, now granted we don't have very much time at all to talk during the day and she has a horrible class of 2nd graders, but its just different. I even went to her and ask her if I had done something to piss her off, she said no, she said that she is just mad at the world and at someone, she won't say who. I'm still getting the feeling that I have done something to her but I'm wracking my brain and can't think of anything. The only positive is when I've talked to her, face to face, I made her laugh 3 times, twice the first time and once the second. Like a full fleged laugh not some wimpy " wow your really not funny " laugh, and she said that I was "fun and outgoing" something I have never really thought about myself. I really want to tell her how I feel but  I don't want to make things worse for her, she has had a really shitty past few days, and even though she told me several times that I've not done anything to her, I still think I have, but I've always thought that I got on peoples nerves and even though my confidence is increasing ( slowly ) there are still times that I feel bad. I don't know what to do....
2wml4g	-21882	1424493823	NoFap	I asked her!	Long story short, I found out some information about my ex and it made me realize I'm not 100% over her yet. But I'm trying, I'm bettering myself by doing nofap, dieting, exercising, ect, and I'm interested in another girl. Well after finding said information all of the pain of the heartbreak came back and I had to have a heart to heart. During the talk with my friend I just basically said "fuck it" and I asked the girl I'm interested in if she would like to do something. I wasn't expecting anything good, my confidence still isn't up to par yet, but she said ok! I was shocked, now granted I haven't seen her in a while because we have had a bad winter here in KY, I text her " Hey, if you're not too busy anytime soon let's do something. Even if we just sit and talked." I figured by me saying " even if we just sat and talked" she would be like "eff no", cause I want to get to know her and to get my mind off of the other girl that broke my heart,but she said "ok I"ll let you know" I know that this probably isn't the best way to ask a girl out but for me it's a start! Just wanted to share.
2x1a4g	-21882	1424813614	NoFap	Noticing more physical features	I'm having to start over again, I've been having trouble with relapses, so I'm at day 2 but I have noticed that, even though I have relapsed a few times, I've not lost 100% of my "superpowers". Things are still great with my friend, its like we have been friends for years, people are starting conversations with me, and I'm getting a few looks. But what I'm really starting to like is that I am noticing more things about women, just like with my friend there is another teacher that I'm friends with and we were talking today, I made sure to hold eye contact, and even when she finished talking she was still looking into my eyes. It was awesome, but I also noticed how pretty her eyes were they were a perfect shade of blue, I had never noticed their color before now. Even though I'm starting over my first goal is to break my longest streak of 2 weeks, then I want to get a effing star, I'm tired of that smiley face mocking me! Has anyone else experienced this? I love it!!
2x5qgx	-21882	1424900597	NoFap	I made her smile today!	Basically, my crush's schedule is very hectic, she has a horrible class, they are the worst bunch of second graders I've ever seen, she coaches softball, and she works a second job on Friday nights. So when we are at work together I don't really get a lot of time to talk to her, but today her class had Library, so I always make sure I'm in the Library on that day ;) and one of her kids said something to me and I spouted of a whity remark and she heard me and she looked at me, in the eyes, and flashed her gorgeous smile and kept it as she walked by. I really like this girl, she is gorgeous and not just physically, hopefully we will get to go out soon, but like I said her schedule is cray cray lol, I know it sounds silly but it made me feel great! Can NoFap make you funnier? Because I was also able to keep my friend laughing the whole time we were talking. 
2xh5ok	-21882	1425144598	NoFap	Paid a compliment yesterday, felt awesome!	So, I started to notice that one of my friends at work had been, not really checking me out, looking at me more and smiling. Well, she had gotten new glasses and she looks really cute in them and I ran into her a couple of times yesterday and I of course smiled and locked eyes with her. Well towards the end of the day I got a chance to talk to her, at first we weren't really talking about anything then before the conversation died I said " I really like your glasses" and she just lit up and said "thank you!" She had apparently showed them to some of her friends and they didn't really seem to like them, so I said " no they look really good on you" she smiled really big and said "aw thanks". I felt like a million bucks, it really helped cause I had had a shitty day. Just wanted to share!
2xiyi8	-21882	1425179641	NoFap	That smiley face is mocking me!	Tomorrow will be a week and I'm so glad that I won't have to see that smiley face anymore. That was, honestly, one thing I hated about relapsing, knowing that I had to look at that damned face again! Things are going great so far, I'm staring to get more looks, people are just being generally nicer to me, my relationship with my friend has gotten better...things are a little rocky with my crush, but I'm not going to let it discourage me. I just feel good! I actually play a game with eye contact, when I'm talking to someone I, of course, lock eyes with them and not in a creepy way lol. Then while we are talking I make them break the eye contact, it was kind of scary at first but as things have gone on I've gotten better at it. I'm also getting better at talking to women, I actually made one girl blush lol. One thing that keeps me going with this is rush of wondering what is going to happen next! ( does that make sense? lol)

2xy8hr	-21882	1425504461	NoFap	Accountability Partner	I think I need one, I'm tired of relapsing, not that I don't love to come on here, but I think someone I could "check in" via text with when times get tough. Would anyone be interested? Male or female, it doesn't matter. 
2xz8et	-21882	1425522570	NoFap	One day at at time....	I'm going to be completely honest, this is much harder than I thought, especially after several relapses. But I am determined to do this, so I'm not giving up, I've reset my badge again, so I'm back at the beginning. Honestly I'm a little discouraged, so any encouragement would me nice. I really think I need an accountability partner, if anyone is interested please let me know. If not I may talk to my friend at work, she has helped me through so much, but I don't want to freak her out. Oh well, just thinking out loud...
2y1ni9	-21882	1425579315	NoFap	I told my friend about my NoFap Journey	I have been struggling with relapse after relapse so I decided to tell a friend of mine about it. I was scared to death to tell her but I had to do something, I figured that this would be a good form of motivation for me, and I was right. She was very receptive and really appreciated the fact that I chose to tell her. She said " It means a lot that you trust me enough to tell me. I'm honored that you chose me as your real life person to tell. It doesn't weird me out at all, we all have our demons and they are different for each person. I'm so amazed at your strength and commitment to healing yourself. Realizing and understanding your triggers are a huge first step. I'm in your corner cheering for you." I feel 100% better for telling her. So now I'm going to make her proud by not giving up on my journey.
2y34je	-21882	1425603167	NoFap	Question about our badges	When are they updated? Like to the roll over at midnight? Or is it just some algorithm? Just curious.. 
2y4s4y	-21882	1425647728	NoFap	" I'm so amazed at your strength and commitment to healing yourself"	I recently told a good friend about my NoFap journey, I was really worried about how she would react. But she actually took it really well! Here is what she said "It means a lot that you trust me enough to tell me. I'm honored that you chose me as your real life person to tell. It doesn't weird me out at all, we all have our demons and they are different for each person. I'm so amazed at your strength and commitment to healing yourself. Realizing and understanding your triggers are a huge first step. I'm in your corner cheering for you." I know I've already posted about this, but it still makes me feel good to read and to know that I want to make her proud. Also are everyone's badges correct? Mine seems to be a day behind, maybe it hasn't updated yet? Stay strong, friends!
2y5iiu	-21882	1425662325	NoFap	Question about K9	I just installed K9 on my macbook and my iphone. But I can't seem to be able to get to the NoFap reddit on my iphone. Any suggestions?

2yb54k	-21882	1425789030	NoFap	NoFap Goals	Ok here are the goals I wish to achieve while doing this.1. 3 weeks ( This will break my longest streak of 2 weeks )2. One Month3. Three Months4. Six Months5. Nine Months6. A Year7. A LifetimeI was thinking of some kind of award system for each goal that is met. But I can't really think of anything, has anyone done this or doing it? If so do you have any suggestions for rewards?
2yjx7y	-21882	1425992052	NoFap	Small Victory Last Night	Ok, so this girl I know kept sending me naked pictures of herself, and she knows I'm doing nofap! So I kept trying to ignore it but eventually I stated edging, I thought " ahh I can restart tomorrow". But the she text me and said ( after sending a fully nude picture ) " so what do you think of that picture? I was going to send it to this guy but I think I it looked weird lol. So I want you to tell me because I'm comfortable with you lol if that makes any sense" That really pissed me off! So I said, out loud, "fuck you and your pictures" and I quit edging and didn't respond. Dumb bitch! Stay stron guys, I'm so glad I didn't waste my streak on her!
300870	-21882	1427114540	NoFap	Badge Question	When you reset your badge, does Day 1 actually count for 2 days? Cause I requested a badge reset on Saturday night around midnight. So shouldn't I be on day 2? I'm just curious.
32aphu	-21882	1428807490	NoFap	Women are starting to look better	Ok, so after several relapses I'm on day 3 and I'm starting to notice that women are looking better. By that I mean women that I originally thought of as a 4 or 5, are now looking like 7's or 8's. ( I'm not trying to sound sexist or anything so please don't think I am ) It's really difficult be cause now I see beautiful women everywhere, has this hapend to anyone else? And if so how long was your streak?
32yqu5	-21882	1429303781	NoFap	Starting out with Depression?	So I have relapsed several times here lately, but I'm trying to get back into nofap. I'm wondering, though, if this has happend to anyone else? This time starting my streak, I'm only one day into it :/, I just feel so alone and worthless. I'm hoping that as my streak goes on I'll feel better. I hope this is just a phase. 
333ahc	-21882	1429411829	NoFap	Relapsed, but still experiencing benefits?	I'm trying to get back on the wagon, but it seems like I can't get past day 2. But the strange thing is, I still experience some of the benefits. Has this happened to anyone?
36p7jl	-21882	1432169943	NoFap	I'm attracted to every woman I see!	It's starting to get on my nerves, mostly because 97% of the women I work with are married. It's like I'm just NOW realizing how beautiful women are. But on the other hand I am more confident around women and can hold great eye contact, and it seems like a few are more flirty with me. Is there anything I can do to combat this? Will it get better or worse? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
39g0w8	-21882	1434031007	NoFap	Flatline: Day 4.	Trying to get back onto the horse again, things are going pretty good. But I'm going through a flatline right now. Just wonder how everyone's else deals with them?
39hydt	-21882	1434056415	NoFap	Starting streak with depression?	I'm on day four and, currently fighting a strong urge, I've noticed that, although I'm on antidepressants, these past few days I've been kind of depressed. I'm just tired of seeing everyone with someone and being happy, not that I'm doing NoFap to get a bunch of girls, I want someone to love. I'm hoping the further I go this will disappear. Has anyone else gone through this?
39unip	-21882	1434322205	NoFap	Discouraged.	I just reset my badge, and I'm kind of taking it hard. When I first started NoFap my longest streak was two weeks. Now I can't seem to get past 3 days. What's strange is I still have some of the "superpowers". Something that seems to be worse then before is my attraction toward women. It's like I want everyone of them, it's really difficult. I'm going to get right back on the horse but I was wondering if anyone could offer some encouragement/ advice. Thanks!
3bgxt7	-21882	1435547645	NoFap	Lonely...	I don't know if this is from constantly restarting, but I'm just so damned lonely. And I've noticed that every time I see a woman I think is attractive it seems to make it worse. Anyone have any advice?
3bpkya	-21882	1435720263	NoFap	Sometimes I wish I could be "upgraded" into a Cyberman	"The Cybermen are a fictional race of cyborgs who are among the most persistent enemies of the Doctor in the British science fiction television programme, Doctor Who. Cybermen were originally a wholly organic species of humanoids originating on Earth's twin planet Mondas that began to implant more and more artificial parts into their bodies as a means of self-preservation. This led to the race becoming coldly logical and calculating, with every emotion deleted from their minds."
3bsgwg	-21882	1435780567	NoFap	Game of Thrones	Does anyone watch it? If so how do you deal with the sex? I know it's not important to the plot, or I don't think it is, so I was thinking I could just fast forward? I have a friend who is wanting me to watch it.
3cco30	-21882	1436219275	NoFap	Day 5!	I finally made it past day 4, it seems like I have been stuck at day 4 for a long time! I'm starting to feel better, I'm,naturally, making eye contact with everyone. But if I don't I make it a point to do it next time. I'm also making it a point to smile at everyone. So I was eating lunch with my family and there was this CUTE red head as our waitress. She had gorgeous eyes, I noticed that when I saw her I gave her a huge smile, and she actually gave me a huge smile back, not one of those fake smiles. It seemed like when she would look at me she would really look at me, if that makes sense, and when I would look away she kept looking at me. I wanted to give her my number, but I didn't really get a chance to talk to her one on one, the restaurant was getting busy, so I wrote my number down and left it on our table. I hope she gets it! It's not much but it's a start. I'm feeling pretty good!
3cje5f	-21882	1436353739	NoFap	Finally got rid of that smiley face!	Im so glad I've made it to a week. That damn smiley face was mocking me!
3cke7a	-21882	1436372758	NoFap	Just something I've noticed.	Does any other guys get a boner when you compliment a woman? Or is this just me? Lol
3dk562	-21882	1437086296	NoFap	I think I'm becoming a hermit!	I don't know if this has anything to do with my PMO addiction or what it is, but it's like I don't want to do anything with people anymore. I would much rather do something alone than with someone else. Granted there was a long time, before I met my ex, that I did stuff alone and I was ok with it. Then my ex and myself would do everything together and it was only us, long story. Now that I'm single again, it's like I would much rather stay home than do anything else, my family keeps inviting me to go to the movie with them and I always end up not going. I don't know whats going on..
3dsb84	-21882	1437263571	NoFap	Starting to take more chances	Ok, so I'm not the best at picking up "signals" from women, but the other day when I went through the drive thru I'm pretty sure the girl was flirting with me. I pull up and flash a full smile, something I have trying to make sure I do when looking at all women, and she said "hi". I handed her my credit card, and she said that "she liked the design on of the card", which is just a skyline. Then she said that I have "such a pretty smile" and that "I'm always seem happy and in a good mood when I come through, compared to other people." I was really taken back, that has never happened, so I'm guessing people are starting to notice me being happy. I didn't have anything to write my number down on at the time, so I drove off still reeling from my encounter. On top of all of that she is really cute and has beautiful eyes. Once I got home I put a notebook in my car, ripped out a page and wrote my number on it.So, I go back to Haredee's today and luckily she is at the window. So I get my cash and before I get up to the window I take that piece of paper and put it behind my 5$ bill, I was trying to be "smooth" lol, I hand her my money and I see her notice the paper. BUT I was so nervous I looked away after she saw the paper, she handed me my drink and I made sure to flash a big smile at her, which she gave me a full smile back. So I dove off feeling pretty awesome about what had happened, but then I realized that I didn't put my name on the paper, and her name tag didn't have her name on it. On top of that I don't know if I should have dropped any hints about the paper or not. Oh well, I took a chance, and even if I don't hear from her I'm still glad I did it. Sorry for the long post lol
3frhql	-21882	1438705720	NoFap	Women, women everywhere!	One of the hardest things I've felt with, and the cause of several relapses, is how amazing women look when you're on a good streak. I just find myself so attracted to all of them, not just sexually. Like I just just want to touch/hold/kiss all of them. I work at an elementary school, and several of the teachers here are GORGEOUS! How do most of you all deal with this?
3gepos	-21882	1439167646	NoFap	..discouraged	I'm really discouraged, I think it has to do with my recent relapses but,I've been having a great couple of weeks. I'm losing weight, I've become more confident, I'm just staring to finally feel happy. So I go to a party that my job was having, and as soon as I get there my anxiety starts to act up and I have a panic attack. I haven't had a panic attack in almost a year, it took me a while to come off of it so basically the whole time I was just a wallflower. Today was such a good day, people have noticed, at work, that I've become more "up beat" and "personable" but I get to that stupid party and I just blend in with the shrubbery! I really wish things would go how you want them to..
3gpqfi	-21882	1439381856	NoFap	"Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more"	I found this quote from Shakespeare very inspiring. I think it could apply to a relapse, which I did, or dealing with urges. I think it's from Henry the Fifth. "Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;Or close the wall up with our English dead.In peace there's nothing so becomes a manAs modest stillness and humility:But when the blast of war blows in our ears,Then imitate the action of the tiger;Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;Let pry through the portage of the headLike the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm itAs fearfully as doth a galled rockO'erhang and jutty his confounded base,Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean."
3h5pcf	-21882	1439689606	NoFap	Gain the Victory Over Masturbation	"A spiritually unhealthy habit, masturbation instills attitudes that foster self-centeredness and corrupt the mind. * A masturbator may also grow to view others as mere sex objects—tools for sexual satisfaction. Sex becomes separated from love and is relegated to a reflex that gives momentary pleasure and relieves sexual tension. But that relief is only temporary. In reality, instead of deadening the body’s members “as respects sexual immorality, uncleanness, [and] uncontrolled sexual passion,” masturbation arouses them.—Colossians 3:5.The apostle Paul wrote: “Beloved ones, let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.” (2 Corinthians 7:1) If you are struggling to heed these words, do not give in to despair. Jehovah is always “ready to forgive” and to help. (Psalm 86:5; Luke 11:9-13) Indeed, your self-condemning heart and your efforts to give up the habit—despite occasional relapses—indicate a good attitude. Keep in mind, too, that “God is greater than our hearts and knows all things.” (1 John 3:20) God sees more than our sins; he sees the whole person. This knowledge enables him to hear with sympathy our earnest pleas for mercy. So never weary of turning to God in humble  and earnest prayer, like a child who goes to his father when in trouble. Jehovah will bless you with a cleansed conscience. (Psalm 51:1-12, 17; Isaiah 1:18) Of course, you need to take positive steps in harmony with your prayers. For example, you would strive to avoid all forms of pornography as well as bad associates. *If your problem with masturbation persists, please speak about the matter with a Christian parent or a spiritually mature and caring friend. *—Proverbs 1:8, 9; 1 Thessalonians 5:14; Titus 2:3-5."Information from www.jw.org
3i0d8h	-21882	1440277960	NoFap	I need to find a hobby	Or something to distract myself, because I have noticed that the last two relapses have been caused by sheer boredom. I wasn't horny or having sexual thoughts I was just bored. 
3j4njo	-21882	1441052693	NoFap	Prolonged eye contact?!	Ok, so if I wasn't doing NoFap I would not pay any attention to this, but I'm on day 4 and I have already noticed several people giving me prolonged eye contact. It's kind of jarring, but the first time was on day 2, I was at a dinner party with my family and I noticed several women locking eyes with me. None of them were my age though they were older than I was. The second time, day 3, was at McDonald's I was going through the drive thru and the woman taking my money, she was very attractive, looked at me and I smiled...and she just kept looking, like she was taken off guard. So I just smiled again when she handed me my change and drove forward. I get my food and I look and there she is again! She was peeking over the shoulder of the guy handing food, I smiled again and she just kept staring...I was like...ok?!The third time was today, day 4, I work at an elementary school and I'm friends with most of my teachers, they are mostly women, I was standing in the hall way as she took her class back to their room and she locked eyes with me and kept walking, so I said "how are you" she said "good how are you?" I said fine. This all happened with our eyes locked on each other, that's when I realized this couldn't be a coincidence!Has this happened to anyone else? How did you handle it? I personally love it! TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!

To make it even worse, they are significantly louder and also tremendously smelly. I have know this for a while, but I just had a new discovery. I guess when I drink this much that quickly, apparently I also get diarrhea. I just found that out literally 30 seconds before I started typing this. I went to go get my laptop so I could defecate and type this at the same time, but found significantly less solid than one would really hope for.

27thry	-21894	1402433312	Advice	Should I send my ex gf the journal I kept?	So I'm going to really try and keep this breif; 2 years back, my gf of 4.5 years broke up with me on the basis that we would get back together when our last semester at university of was over. I kept a journal of my thoughts and feelings during the time and I was going to give it to her after we were back together. As you all can probably guess, she just flat out told me to fuck off. I still have the journal which have a little over a months worth of entries in. Today, I stumbled across the journal which I haven't looked at since November 2012. I haven't interacted with her since but I still really hold a grudge against her, so I thought it would be therapeutic to make one last entry, pretty much telling her how shitty of a person she is. Now I want to send it to her; kind of one last big "fuck you". Do you think I should do it?

My friend registered for some online summer classes and everything got covered by federal aids and loans. My friend got refund checks, which she spent on getting her car fixed and other things. For some unknown reason to me (she says its a long story) she had to drop one of the classes. Because of this, she lost the aid and loans. She owes like $5k because of this. I know this situation looks bleak, but I'm asking for any advice you guys could give us. Thanks! Also, if there is a more appropriate subreddit for this question, I would appreciate being pointed in that direction

I can do about 15 reps for 3 sets before I start to fatigue. I also have a forearm developer that I used, and I do some accessory body weight exercises. I end up working out for about 20-25 minutes before I get pretty tired. At this point in my training, is whey really going to help me at all, or should I get use to working out for longer periods? The real question ends up being "Is it really even worth the money for me at this point"? Thanks guy!

2l5vjp	-21894	1415028381	acne	I was feeling better until today	My face is pretty good, except for my forehead, which has recently been plagued for the past 4 to 5 weeks. I've been making progress very slowly, but progress, so I was kind of starting to feel better. What was really making me feel better though was some of the posts people were making. You guys have been saying how we criticize our pimples way more than anyone else. This made me feel better. Until today. I work in a cardiologists office most days of the week from 9 30 - 11 30, but I don't actually see him that often. I saw him today for the first time in a while, and the first thing he said to me was "What happened to your forehead?" Now I feel like I have lost all my confidence I had spent a few weeks making.

Tonight I was doing squats at 110 lbs, and after 6 reps of the first set, I was literally exhausted, like i had to sit down for a few minutes. I did another 5 reps in my second set but after that I couldn't go any more. All my other exercises during leg day are fine, its just squats that are killing me and I am so exhausted after even after a relatively light set. Does anyone have any advice on what I should be doing to not be spent during my first set?

g5lbc	-21903	1300329520	gaming	Want to help a fellow gamer reach a gaming milestone, donate money to Child's Play Charity, and do it all while playing a free game?!	Greetings fellow Redditors! Long time lurker first time poster looking to make my first post something worthwhile. For the past few months I have been taking a crack at a game called League of Legends, a free well designed multiplayer game from a company called riot games. Now, recently it came to my attention that the company offers a rather impressive refer a friend incentive. It goes a little something like this:Here’s how it works: every friend that reaches level 5 will net you a 4 win IP boost that you can redeem whenever you want. In addition, every time you reach one of the following reward tiers, you will receive a unique reward.                                                                                                                                                                       * 10 - Tier 3 Champion    * 25 - Forum Title – “Recruiter”    * 50 - Grey Warwick Champion Skin    * 100 - The League of Legends Digital Collector’s Pack    * 150 - Forum Title – “Senior Recruiter”    * 200 - 10,000 Riot Points    * 250 - Forum Title – “Master Recruiter”    * 350 - Ultra-rare champion skin – Champion will be selected by the first player to reach this tier*    * 500 - Get your name added to the “Wall of Fame” in the Riot Office    * 1,000 - A content element will be named after your summoner    * 5,000 - All current and future content permanently unlocked    * 10,000 - All expenses paid trip to visit Riot Games and develop a champion with the Riot Design TeamAccomplishing 10,000 recruits reaching level five is no small task and just asking the Reddit community to just help me is beyond greedy so I decided instead to help out a charity that is close to many of us in the gaming community; Child's Play. This foundation donates millions of dollars each year in games, movies, and books to hospitals around the globe. I'll add a link to their site at the bottom of this post. The offer I give is this: For ever 100 people that join up and reach level 5 I will donate $10  to the charity adding up to a final $1000 dollars. I truly wish I could give more buy I am by no means a wealthy individual. I also encourage anyone who helps in this endeavor to donate $1 if they so choose to the charity. If you have any questions feel free to leave them in the comments or PM to me. Refer a friend sign-up link and Child's play home page listed below. I will update and edit this post accordingly thank you in advance for reading!http://www.childsplaycharity.org/index.php Child's play Chairtyhttp://signup.leagueoflegends.com/?ref=4d49a65cc2ceb302190074 League of legends refer a friend link

Hola he estado refrexionando durante un tiempoHE llegado a esta conclusión (se que algunos no OS gustada pero es mi opinión)PODEMOS NO ES PERFECTOPODEMOS NO ES NADA QUE DIGAMOS QUE ES UN PARTIDO QUE TIENE TODO PERFECTONI TAMPOCO ME GUSTA ALGUNAS PROPUESTAS QUE TIENE DECISIONES QUE TOMAN ETC...PERO!Se que este es mi partido y se que es el cambio que necesita EspañaEspaña muchos diréis que no tiene soluciónQue pa que votarPara que seguir la lucha...Y no lo veo asíCuando apareció podemos se habrio la brecha del bipartidismo cuando apareció podemos vi una salida a esta situaciónYO NO VOTO DESDE HACE 10 AÑOScuando bi a podemos por primera vez pensé que no llegaría a NADAPasadon los meses vi como se colocaba primero en las encuestas vi el 31E bi todo lo que hizo podemosY dije VOTARE y desde entonces estoy luchando para que podemos llegue al poderDesde entonces DIA A DIA lucho habro de podemos porque tengo esperanzas de que llegue al poder y creo en este cambio y creerme algunas decisiones que han tomado no me han gustado NADA pero esto es un gran partido con fallos, SI,Pero cada vez que habrá inda, despotrican los medios, manipulan etc... Vuelvo a podemos CON MUCHA MAS FUERZA En estas elecciones son mas importantes que ninguna que haya tenido EspañaEn estas elecciones nos jugamos acabar con la mafia de este paísDespués del 24M me han reanimado mucho las fuerza Y si, estoy cansado por tanto ataque por tanta manipulación por tanto ataque facha e incluso de la propia izquierda que nos ataca día a diaPero sabéis que OS digo Diga lo que digan creo que este es un gran partido que si gobierna podría mejorar la vida de todos los ciudadanos españoles con participación con mas democracia, con propuestas ciudadanas, con un gobierno de verdad que trabaja para la gente etc...Se que este partido no es perfecto Se que nunca contentada a todo el mundo ESO ES IMPOSIBLEPERO también es cierto que sus propuestas y sus actos los honran Si en estas elecciones dejamos pasar una OPORTUNIDAD UNICA DE ACABAR CON ESTA MAFIA ESPAÑOLA como dice el titulo ya sera tarde mañana Y podeso sigo luchando podeso estoy aquí e aguantado insultos e incluso discusiones por la calle por defender a este partido Pero estoy aquí por que como decíaE visto una oportunidad que no se volverá a repetirse NUNCA Acabar con el PPSOE Oigo aveces gente decepciónada con este partido y yo les respondo No te puede decepcionar un partido que tiene propuestas de sentido común de rescate ciudadano y que nunca a gobernado y que su objetivo es democratizar españa (si lo hacen mal ya les diré de todo y no nada bueno....)Que se a moderado? Sinceramente eso no me lo creoCreo que es meramente una estrategiaEllos lo que quieren ganar y muchos me diréis que no todo vale para ganar..Pero no es como pensamos..Aquí se juega el futuro de hijos nietos etc..Nos jugamos generaciones Y si, tambien tenéis razón pero EB que sentido moderarse? Yo veo sus propuestas no lo que me dice la tele y saco conclusiones y opiniones propias No se a moderado mucho en ciertas cosas, si en ciertos puntos pero como decía la radicalidad nunca llega a nada en españaMirar a Cs extrema derecha pero oculta su rostro de facha y se muestra de Centro e ahy su ascenso... Y ojo con eso no digo que nos padezcamos a la mierda de Cs...Aparte, Gente comparando podemos con psoe Cuando eso ni tiene pies ni cabeza, PSOE no es izquierda Como mucho centro... Y tirando a la derecha....Escribo todo esto Por que estoy cansado de gente que dice que esta decepcionado y aparte queria compartir mi reflexión como digo al principio Y como dice el titulo TENEMOS UNA OPORTUNIDAD DE ORO DE CAMBIAR ESTONO LA MALGASTEMOS POR ESTUPIDECES POR MANIPULACIÓNESPOR MENTIRASO POR GENTE QUE DICE QUE ES CASTAPOR QUÉ SINCERAMENTE NO SON NADA DE ESOSON LA SALVACION DE GENERACIONES ENTERASNOSOTROS NUESTROS NIETOS O HIJOS NO SE MEDECEN UN FUTURO ESCURO CON PPSOEPENSEMOS EN UN FUTURO MEJORPOR QUE SI SE PUEDE!!!!!!!!Y seguiría Tengo para rato...Pero solo quería compartir un poco de mi reflexión y mi opiniónGracias (por favor si no OS gusta no insulteis)

JajajajajNo aguanta ni un mes como todas las repúblicas que han caídoBueno yo paso de discusiones como dije soy critico pero no ahora que a falta de 5 meses podemos conseguir un futuro mejor...Para mi es mejor tener un país mejor que un puto reglamento de primarias que lo único que conseguimos con nuestra desunión y discusiones es que vuelba a ganar el PPSOE 30 años mas pero e vosotros a lo vuestro y yo a lo mio intentare que gane el partido por todos los medios y vosotros podéis seguir dinamitandolo para hacerle el camino al ppsoePOR CIRTO A MI TAMPOCO ME GUSTAN COMO ESTAN ECHAS LAS PRIMARIAS PERO YA HABRA TIEMPO PARA DISCUTIR ESO

178n1z	-21906	1359090049	progun	My Reply from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid 	Sorry if this has already been posted, Dear Leisurely_Loris: Thank you for contacting me to express your views regarding gun control. I appreciate hearing from you. As a gun owner, I welcomed the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, which made clear that every law abiding citizen has an individual constitutional right to keep and bear arms.  We must work to protect this right by enforcing laws that keep guns away from terrorists and criminals.  However, the rights of responsible gun owners should not be compromised by individuals who use firearms to commit crimes. Please be assured that I have noted your views regarding this issue, and that I will continue to use my leadership position in the Senate to defend the Second Amendment and to protect the interests of Nevada's gun owners. Again, thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts with me. For more information about my work for Nevada, my role in the United States Senate Leadership, or to subscribe to regular e-mail updates on the issues that interest you, please visit my Web site at http://reid.senate.gov. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future. My best wishes to you. Sincerely,HARRY REIDUnited States Senator
18hh90	-21906	1360806481	progun	Instead of arming a school staff with firearms, they could be issued non-lethal defensive tools. 	See taser. Instead of shooting bullets they shoot the electrical leads. Why is this not being discussed when people mention the "arming of a school's staff"? I could see several instances when this would be useful such as instead of the shooter continuing on the rampage with unarmed faculty and then turning the weapon on himself, he would be incapacitated and we could then "study" the how's and why's someone would do such a thing an maybe, just maybe, develop some more intelligent ways of defending against these events.

18xms6	-21906	1361419640	DIY	One of the bedroom doors lost a fight with a foot. Here's how I repaired the damage... (Album inside)	[Album](http://imgur.com/a/nKzpL)I originally set out to just buy a new door but after not being able to find any doors with the fake "wood-grain" I decided to just repair it myself. Basically I cut out the damaged pieces, used a small Alan wrench to pull a piece of cardboard up against the inside of the door and glued it with the wife's hot glue gun. Then, I put some Elmer's wood filler in a ziplock and "piped" it into the small crevices and used a putty knife for the rest. Sanded and re-applied a few times to make sure it was smooth and level. I used the back side of an exacto knife to etch the wood grain into the dried wood filler. Had some left-over paint in the garage that was used when they originally painted the house. I can hardly tell it was busted!
1bi1z3	-21906	1364884626	cordcutters	Just cancelled dish, can I use the existing wiring/mount to simplify an OTA install?	Basically I have the mounting plate and three runs of coax that run to a (lnb-less) satellite dish. If I remove the dish, install an OTA antenna and splitter, hook this up to the three wires, would it send a signal to the same tv's that the dish was? The dish's current location is also not near a power supply. What other options of boosting the signal are there?Update: I took down just the dish portion and mounted theanfenna to its mast. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/ZGBGMBK.jpg) is a pic of it installed. I just connected the 3 coax wires to a three way splitter under the eve and have a perfect signal at all three tv locations! Thx for the help all...

I was wondering about  the fit and quality of their clothes and how much difference there is between their regular fit and their slim fit ones? For the record I'm very skinny and fairly tall. The main items I was looking at were the [cotton cardigan](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/sweaters/cotton/PRDOVR~65706/99102609084/ENE~1+2+3+22+4294967294+20~~~16~15~all~mode+matchallany~~~~~cardigan/65706.jsp), [slim chambray shirt](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_special_shops/slimshop/PRDOVR~43683/99102354620/ENE~1+2+3+22+4294967294+20~~~16~15~all~mode+matchallany~~~~~chambray/43683.jsp) and a [regular fit plaid shirt](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_feature/NewArrivals/shirts/PRDOVR~74618/99102653640/ENE~1+2+3+22+4294967294+20~~~16~15~all~mode+matchallany~~~~~plaid/74618.jsp).Cheers

vx6if	-21907	1341232567	madmen	After re watching season 5, here's a huge dump of thoughts I had over the finale, particularly about Roger, Pete, Megan and Peggy.  	Season 5 of Mad Men had a stunning final few episodes and is easily my favourite season so far (maybe after season 4). As a whole this season has been less subtle than past seasons but this worked to get through a lot of big stories and developments and more blunt themes. Many big moments occurred this season and the finale is where they all came together.We find Roger back on LSD and while I adored the enlightened Roger “For all we know Jesus was trying to get the loaves and fishes account” Sterling during the middle of the season, it’s clear that they are setting up the scene for some sort of addiction. Of course that raises the issues of not only the affects for SCDP and business, but his personal life, being that he’s already been through two divorces and clearly feels alone. Mona outright states “I thought you married Jane because I had gotten old, and then I realised it was because you had.” He wants to be enlightened and feel young and happy, and LSD seems to give him that. Not to mention the fact that this he’s already suffered two heart attacks on the show, it brings up concerns about the longevity of one of my favourite character on TV. Of course with only two seasons to go before the show wraps up, and the clear fact that the writers are willing to go to dark and unexpected places, some sort of fatal cardiac arrest whilst in the middle of a late 60s LSD fuelled orgy would be a fitting end to the life of Roger “Stop being demure, you're already on the bed” Sterling.Pete now seems truly unhappy. He’s just sad; he doesn’t know what he wants. He realises the life he should have, and should want, and wants to want-Don’s life. A partner and key employee at the SCDP, a nice wife and a family with a nice home and an office with a view, literally the same view as Don’s. But at the end of the day that is Don’s life (well half of it anyway), not his own and not what he truly wants, it’s simply a “temporary bandage on a permanent wound.” I always liked Pete’s character, and while I feel that’s really more of a credit to Vincent Karthiser’s work than anything else, I do want him to succeed. As satisfying as it is to see him be repeatedly punched in his snivelling face, I think the president of the “Howdy Doodie Circus Club” just needs a break, and his final monologue was strikingly melancholic. This is contrasted with Trudy’s clear love for him. Worried about him, she finally agrees to move to Manhattan. Pete gets what he wants from his wife by getting in a fight with the husband of the wife he was having an affair with, while she was in hospital after receiving electroshock therapy and subsequently losing the memory of who Pete was; you don’t get more Mad Men than that. Moving on to Megan we have this contrast between the ambitious Megan, with all the passion and sexuality of the Zou Bisou Bisou performance, when she was strong and outgoing and seemed to be the prefect woman to be able to play Don. But now she’s appears much more weak, she just gets given her career by Don, again. Of course who’s to say that it’s not all a part of her ‘act’. From the “You cant have this” stunt, to teaching Sally to cry, to outright snaking her friend’s audition request, it’s clear she knows what she wants, and how to get it, and knows the exact buttons to hit to get Don to sing. Megan may not be the most watchable character on the show, but there’s clearly something interesting about her, we hardly know anything about the character and the more that’s revealed the more it seems to be hinting that it’s all an act. Compare this to the other woman in Don’s life, Peggy. In my view the strongest character on the show, she’s come around and grown a sterling reputation. From her work being praised by Clearasil to demanded for by Topaz, Peggy is fast becoming the new Don Draper (she’s even ‘draping’). It always felt like Anna and Peggy were Don’s only two real female companions, and now they’ve both left him. She may be stuck in a cheap hotel room, far from Paris, with a view of two dogs doing it Dothraki style, but she’s content. She’s on a business trip, in charge of her team, and if she lands that coveted Virginia Slims account she may well become one of the biggest players on Madison Avenue.So what do you think? What I really love about Mad Men is that there are just so many things happening, I could write about it for days. And everyone has their own interpretations about what's going on, so let me hear your thoughts. 
whyj7	-21907	1342187578	Minecraft	The Unfortunate Tale of my first Hardcore Minecraft World 	I started playing MC when it was in Alpha, and stopped playing around beta 1.8. Now, well after the official release, I decided to go back and try and finish the game. From beginning to the literal End, on Hardcore mode. I generate the world and spawn in front a ton of sheep; so inevitably, I proceed to slaughter them all. I get a bunch of wool so I can make a bed right off the bat, sleep through the night and not have to deal with zombies and creepers. I still think that the bed is a bit of a cop out, some of my favourite moments from Minecraft were scrambling though the night trying to get back home, or building a makeshift house in the dirt and waiting it out until sunrise. It was always a fun challenge to have to frantically collect wood and build torches and a house as soon you spawn to live through he first night. I think it would be better if sheep didn’t drop wool when you killed them, and you could only get wool with a shear, meaning you have to find iron first. Then you at least have to play for a while and go exploring. [1](http://i.imgur.com/QxnHJ.png)Anyway I spawned in a great area, after about 10 minutes I’ve got a bed, a set of tools and enough wooden planks and coal to last a lifetime. I set up a small farm so I can have a nice supply of food throughout the game, and block it off so the damn sheep wouldn’t trample my crops. After sleeping off the first night I go exploring for a bit (and I’m unexpectedly excited about coming back to check on my farm and seeing my crops grow. Farming is weirdly fun and satisfying, especially when you need food to survive in a permanent-death game). So far things have gone far better than expected, I have food and weapons and seem to be in a great position. [2](http://i.imgur.com/42F1W.jpg)As I walk past a lake onto a hill, I notice an Enderman. Of course, Endermen don’t like it when you notice them. So now I’m deadlocked, trapped in the Enderman’s gaze, deciding what to do. He’s standing on a hill staring at me with his creepy jaw wide open, and I’m standing below the hill right in front of a lake. I figure I’m in a pretty good position here, I have weapons and full health and a lake to back me up. So I turn around and run into the water. He immediately teleports behind me and takes damage from the water before teleporting out somewhere. I walk over the hill and sprint at it, hitting it twice with my stone sword. At this point I figure I’ve won the battle and should get a nifty Ender Pearl early in the game, since it’s taken two hits and water damage. It teleports behind me and hits me, I turn around and it’s gone. Then I hear it materialise behind me again, so I turn around and before I could react it hits me again, I get knocked off the hill, take fall damage, and die. Death in Hard Core mode is permanent. World deleted. Final score, 71.So that was my foray back into Minecraft. No diamond, no Nether, no Ender Dragon, just half an hour of walking around before getting annihilated by an Enderman.And I never got to see my crops grow.

xo3ay	-21907	1344084513	AskReddit	As a web developer, out of curiosity I'd like to know, what are your internet viewing preferences? What browser do you use? What zoom level is it on? Do you use Ad Blocker? Why?	So I'm really curious to know how most people are viewing the internet. What browser do you use and why do you use that one? What zoom level do you keep your browser on? On Chrome on my Macbook I have it at 144%, and people freak out when they see my super zoomed in screen. Do you use Ad Blocker? If so, specifically why do you use it? Do you just not like the idea of ads, do you do it for sheer convenience even though it mainly just hurts the content creators, or do you unblock ads on sites you enjoy such as Reddit? Do you use a bunch of extensions? And are the ones you use mainly functional that add something major and new and cool (like RES), or a little tweak that makes things more convenient (like hoverzoom), or something just for aesthetic purposes. Those were the main areas I was thinking of, but feel free to share any of your other preferences!I also want to add, it's not really just the answers I'm curious about, but I want to know why. What's the reasoning behing your preferences?

I've wanted to build a computer for a while, and then I found this awesome subreddit and decided to give it a go!

So are parts like the cooler and PSU I have alright?Also is it worth getting the UD3H motherboard over the D3H? It's not that much extra but I'm going over budget as it is. Altogether this is around $1100-1200 in Australia, which is pretty ridiculous considering it's about $950 from America, but what can you do.Thanks!

I'm having a lot of trouble deciding on a good monitor to buy. Since I'm spending a bunch on a new computer I might as well get a good monitor to actually utilise it. First of all, will my build be good enough to run games at a high enough frame rate on high settings to actually take advantage of a 120hz monitor? If it can what are some good 120hz monitors I can get for around $300? Or would I be better off getting a good IPS monitor? I don't actually play competitive shooters that often, right now I'm mostly on single player games like Skyrim, Dishonored, and Borderlands 2. But I do like to break out Battlefield 3 every once in a while, and I heard for fast paced shooters like that, a 120hz monitor is invaluable.

1494bz	-21907	1354607926	buildapc	Definitive way to get Windows 7 for an Australian student? Or clean install windows 8?	All the threads and places I've searched have information that is either now outdated, or refer to deals that no longer exist or have been replaced with windows 8 stuff. So I'm building a PC for the first time and I don't know how to get Windows 7 without resorting to paying $250 for the retail pack. I can't seem to find any student deals anywhere and don't really want to wait 3 months until Uni opens again to see what they have. I made a dreamspark account and couldn't find anything for Australia there either. Otherwise, is it possible to install windows 8 straight onto my new PC from a dvd? All I can find is the upgrade version that you download from the microsoft website. Although I would prefer to run Windows 7. Any help would be great! Thanks!

I have extensive experience with my Army issued Beretta 92 as well as my personally owned handguns (S&amp;W J/K/L Frame, M&amp;P 9mm).  My schedule allows me to get to the range 1-2 times a month to enjoy IDPA style drills with military buddies and/or teach my 9 year old how to shoot.  I am no expert, but would consider myself useful in a zombie apocalypse.  I do conceal carry in the state of NY.WHAT I WAS TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN PURCHASING A SIG P250C in .380Many folks question the purpose behind a large .380 ACP pistol.  I can understand their position.  Ultimately, I was trying to meet the following goals:1) Replace my wife's home defense pistol.  She owned a 9mm Taurus PT111 Millennium Pro (12 round magazine) which we purchased almost 10 years ago.  Selfishly, I did not like her pistol (like it matters, right?): parts loosened when fired, it was a chore to field strip, and very snappy recoil.  I wanted her to "upgrade." 2) Replace my concealed carry weapon once I leave the state of NY.  My current CCW is a Smith 60-10 (3 inch stainless steel 5 shot revolver in .38/.357 MAG).  I wanted to see if I could find a handgun of near equal size with increased capacity and minimum recoil for concealed carry.INITIAL IMPRESSIONMy initial impression when unboxing the pistol was positive.  My P250C came in a SIG Sauer cardboard box with one magazine, owner's manual, pistol lock, and a small packet of lubricant plus lubricant brochure.  The pistol was solid and well put together.  I think the Nitron finish looks great.  There was factory grease on the pistol.I would not describe the P250C as a compact.  It feels more like a "sub-full."  She has some size to her.  The P250C has a picatinny rail for mounting laser/lights.I disassembled the pistol per factory instructions in order to inspect, clean, and lubricate it.  No issues with this process.  RANGE IMPRESSIONSDuring my first trip to the range, I fired 100 rounds of Sellier and Belloit 92 grain FMJ ammunition.  This was my initial break in and familiarization process with the pistol.  There was no failure to feed or failure to extract with these 100 rounds.  I then fired 10 rounds of 90 grain Hornady Critical Defense for chronograph purposes (results later).  No issues here either.  So far, 110 trigger squeezes and 110 bullets successfully fired.If I had to highlight two things about my first 110 rounds it would be:1) Trigger Pull2) Felt RecoilThe trigger pull is as long as you have heard.  It is also very consistent.  The trigger pull is longer than my Smith and Wesson 66 revolver.  However, the SIG pull is more consistent and lighter than the revolver.  If you are concerned about the trigger pull, I recommend you ask a FLGS if you can dry fire a P250C in their shop.  I knew what I was getting into when I purchased the pistol.  The trigger will take some time to get used to, but I don't feel it is insurmountable for self defense purposes.The recoil for the P250C is minimal.  I could shoot this pistol all day if I wanted to.  My 5'0" wife as well as a recoil sensitive person could handle this .380 ACP as well.  I would describe the felt recoil as between a Ruger .22 pistol and a .38 special cowboy load.  The recoil was more of a nudge in my hand than a snap.Ultimately, I was the limiting factor, not the pistol, with regards to accuracy.  The first 15 rounds were fired at a target from 7 yards and all struck center mass.  After some familiarization, I moved to 10 and then 15 yards.  At these distances, I was still able to strike center mass.  My shots were very slow and deliberate as I tried to become accustomed to the trigger pull and ergonomics of the gun.  I can put all my shots into a paper plate at 15 yards but am not happy with my group.  If I want to put holes on top of holes from self defense range, it will require more practice with this pistol in order to get used to the trigger pull.  I'm confident that with time, I can get groups that I am satisfied with.  Other range thoughts…I had zero issue with the SIG contrast sights.  Very easy target acquisition.I easily loaded a brand new magazine to full 15 round capacity.  I've read on some forums that people had a very difficult time with the magazine.  I am not Hercules.  It made 15 rounds fit and my thumbs are neither sore nor discolored. THINGS TO CONSIDER BEFORE YOU BUY THE .380 ACP COMPACTThe P250C in .380 has different dimensions than other P250Cs (Length of 6.7" vs 7.2").  I have not found a molded leather holster for this gun.  I am exploring custom Kydex options.The .380 compact version of the P250 loses some modularity options.  Unlike 9mm, .40, etc…you cannot change the grip from a medium sized grip module to a small or a large grip module.  I have small hands and the medium grip is almost too big for me.  I would have liked an option to change the grip to a small grip.  Additionally, there is no .380 subcompact x-change kit available at the time of this writing.DID THE P250C DO WHAT I WANTED IT TO DO?No.  But it is probably my fault for not doing enough research.  The P250C .380 is a quality firearm that shoots well.  However, it is not yet completely meeting my needs.  For a compact pistol, I found the grip to be too large for my wife and I thought I had the option to go to a smaller module (my mistake…but let me serve as a warning for others).  She has yet to fire it, but I am 99% certain the recoil will not be an issue.  Additionally, her Taurus 9mm was DAO with a very long and mushy trigger pull--this should not be a big transition for her.I cannot carry the P250C yet until I figure out holster options.  While there are multiple P250C holster options, I have not yet seen a P250C .380 ACP holster option.  I did not realize until purchasing the .380 version that the dimensions are not the same as the more common calibers.  I've spoken to many custom holster makers--several of them did not even know this pistol existed.  What would help address this for future buyers is if SIG updated the products section of their website to feature the .380 P250C.  Additionally, SIG should upload the most current owner's manual onto their documents.  I suppose I could have called and asked a SIG Customer Service rep if the dimensions were the same before spending $500 on a pistol.  Again, let my mistake be a warning for you.I purchased the P250C .380 because I wanted a different "capability" from my CCW.  When comparing the P250C to my J Frame, the P250C is smaller with 3 times the ammunition capacity.  When fully loaded, both firearms weigh 29 oz.  My thought process is that 15 rounds of less powerful .380 ACP in an equally sized package would be superior to 5 rounds of .38/357.  Additionally, I rationalized that .380 would be softer shooting and allow better follow up shots.For reference, during my range time, I fired 10 rounds of 90 grain Hornady .380 Critical Defense ammunition out of the P250C through a chronograph.  The average muzzle velocity was 932 fps.During the same session, I fired 10 rounds of 110 grain Hornady .38 Critical Defense from my Smith 60-10 through the chronograph.  The average muzzle velocity was 870 fps.  I'm not going to sweat a less than 10% increase in muzzle velocity from a nearly 20% lighter bullet.  Without getting in a debate on ballistics, I feel comfortable with the P250C .380 for self defense.  I would carry this soft shooting, high capacity gun if my wife turns her back on it (refuses to keep it her night stand).  Now I just need a holster.  Until that holster materializes, I will be just as well off carrying my full size M&amp;P 9mm once I leave NY.  The dimensions are not too different, there are an abundance of holster options, and 9mm recoil in a full size pistol is negligible to me.  Finally, nobody will argue that 17 rounds of 9mm are inferior to 15 rounds of .380ACP.  CONCLUSIONThe P250C is high quality but I would recommend exploring other options for concealed carry.  The pistol will be more than suitable for home defense if you are looking for a high capacity and minimal recoil firearm which can be left in a night stand.  Ultimately, I think the P250C fills a very small niche and unless that niche applies to you or you have $500 burning a hole in your pocket, you may be better off elsewhere.  Shortcomings such as holster availability and a lack of complete modularity hold the pistol back.Here are some photos of the pistol and from the range.[SIG Album](http://imgur.com/a/cRUhY)I will check this thread to answer any questions that come up.

I sat at a table and the two NRA instructors lectured, straight from a manual, the IL laws.  It was very difficult to stay awake/pay attention to.  Not that I didn't try...but without visual aids or much interaction, it isn't my personal preferred learning style.After several hours of lecture, the instructors showed us various draw techniques so we could get to our handguns, beneath our clothing, efficiently and then get on target.  It was a great process and while I'd have to continue practicing to commit it to muscle memory--I welcomed the lesson.  Afterwards, the instructors showed students how to draw when seated at a dinner table and in a vehicle.In addition to the practical exercise, the instructor asked me to demonstrate my grip and stance...which, for me, has always been a Weaver.  He suggested I try the Modern Isosceles and coached me through it.  He then went into further detail about what he felt were the strengths and weaknesses of the stances.  I'm one of those guys who doesn't get offended when being taught new things and told him I'd try this stance for my qualification...Qualification was quick and painless.  I put all 30 rounds of 9mm from my Colt Defender in the X or 9 ring of a B27 target.  I felt I shot better from Isosceles than I did from Weaver.  Maybe I can still learn new tricks if I keep an open mind.  These instructors seemed very serious about making sure I "did the right thing" for qualification.  Some other instructors I researched provide .22 Rugers for qualification.  Right, wrong, or indifferent...I don't agree with that approach although it is withing the limits of the law.If I could critique these folks, it would be to improve their delivery of IL laws.  Yes.  The material is dry...but handouts or Power Point slides would go a long way.  Unfortunately, the course was completed at the instructor's kitchen table...so I think a slide show may be a bridge too far.I paid my $153.50 to the state this morning.  Don't feel like the extra expense of fingerprinting is worth it.  I've waited all my life for IL CCW...I can wait 30 extra days.How did everybody else's class go?  Did you all cover the same things in the curriculum?

Riker graduated 8th in his class yet somehow ends up on an Oberth Class ship?  One would think Starfleet has a better method of assigning cadets with extraordinary potential to a better initial posting.  While I can't speak for the Navy or Air Force, but in the Army, the higher ranked cadets get first pick on their initial assignment.  I can't imagine a hot shot like Riker wouldn't have scored an Ambassador Class ship right out of the Academy.

I don't know if there are many others who feel about this the way I do, but personally I hate the way the horses control in skyrim. Having to constantly hold down the forward key/control stick is a chore and the horses are superslow with almost no acceleration. Is there a mod out there that revamps the horse controls to work more like they did in Oblivion, or even similar to how they work in Mount and Blade? I realise that making a mod like this could be quite a challenge, so I won't be surprised if it doesn't exist.

Personally I would like to see a [drum mag for the IZHMA](http://www.gunlistings.org/uploads/l1_shotguns_converted_saiga_12_shotgun_with_drum_45229.jpg) to bring up its mag size up a bit and a [third barrel mod for the Mosconi](http://www.dudeiwantthat.com/gear/weapons/triple-barrel-shotgun-8398.jpg).

2tbwi2	-21921	1421961650	MortalKombat	If Kabal was in MKX...	I think I figured out how they could make Kabals possible variations in the game super-interesting. Basically, the MK wiki page for Kabal states that an early form of the character wore wrist-mounted buzzsaws as his weapon. Wouldn't it be extremly cool if they brought this back as one of his variations? The first variation would be him using his Hookswords, the second one focusing on his speed and last one using the previously mentioned buzzsaws. Maybe Im biased because Im a big Kabal fan but I think this would make him really diverese and cool.
2tgd5d	-21921	1422052936	MortalKombat	What related new characters would you like to see in MKX?	So we all know by now that MKX will have a lot of new characters who are related to old characters in some way. So far we Cassie Cage as the daughter of Johnny Cage and Sonya in the game, and Takeda as Kenshi's son in the comic. Whos elses relatives would you like to see? Personally I think a female tarkatan would be really cool. I like Baraka as a character but they could easily replace him with any other Tarkatan and that character would be just as badass.

2vrd3r	-21921	1423830666	MortalKombat	I noticed something about Reptile	So in the latest stream, they showed off Reptile's alternate skin but then said they wouldn't talk too much about it because it would reveal story details. Notice how his alternate is less "reptile"-looking than his main, and more ninja-like. As well as this, one of his variations is called "Deceptive", as in Deception. I think both these things hint to that the dragon king storyline might return in some form in MKX.
2wcmvm	-21921	1424291761	MortalKombat	Any klassic MK songs you would like to return to MKX?	And since everyone is gonna say it, the original MK movie theme doesn't count... Alright, fine. Say it if you want.Anyways, what themes from old MK games would you like to see remastered in MKX? Personally I would really love the Character Select Theme from MK3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVSSBOa280kI also think this theme is super kick-ass, would like to see a version in MKX with better audio and more instruments: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V36WhNC8vA
2xa4uu	-21921	1424988141	MortalKombat	What was the code Tyler put in?	During the stream, after their first fight for the belt Tyler got real serious and appeared to be typing in a code. But I saw no change in the following match. Did anyone see what the code did?
2xgvmh	-21921	1425139025	MortalKombat	What do you all think of the new characters?	I'm talking about Kung Jin, Jacqui and Takeda. What do you think of them? Personally my favorite of the three is Kung Jin, he has such a cool design and seeing his gameplay with the bow will be interesting. Takeda looks pretty cool I guess, but I'm a bit sceptical because of his hook-things that he will play too similarly to Scorpion. We will just have to wait and see. Jacqui I'm not too keen on. I always though Jax was really boring, and Jacqui doens't seem much more interesting in my opinion. She does seem to have flamethrowers or something on her wrists which I guess could be pretty cool, but I have never liked the special forces characters too much (except for Cassie, she's awesome) so it will be hard to win me over. I think she would have a more interesting design if she wasn't just a chick in a uniform, maybe if she had a metal jaw or something like that to make her stand out more.
2yxh3f	-21921	1426267459	MortalKombat	What do you think we will see during the stream?	So the stream will cover a story "25 years in the making". What do you think they will show? The obvious choice is that they show off the first chapter of the story, but personally I really don't want them to do this because I don't want anything from the story spoiled before the game comes out. My hope is that they go through all the story-related characters they have shown lately, like Johnny, Sonya and the kids, and show us their fighting styles.

Since the full roster has been revealed, I would like to know which characters that didn't make the cut you want to see as DLC if NRS ever make a second Kombat Pack. Mine are these:[Kabal](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130116201254/villains/images/0/02/Kabal's_MK9_Ending.jpg)[Sektor/Cyrax](http://th09.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/f/2010/166/2/d/Mortal_Kombat___Sektor_by_fear_sAs.jpg)[Havik](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/mkwikia/images/0/01/Havikmk2011.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110503091247)[Noob Saibot](http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1807564-noobsaibot2010.scorpionblaze.jpg)I'm personally not against guest characters, but I would rather see returning MK characters as DLC.
32yvth	-21921	1429306183	MortalKombat	So since we have a MK1 living tower arriving soon...	... Does anyone else really hope that the reward for completing the tower will be MK1 klassic skins for the ninjas? Unfortunately NRS would probably sell the skins as DLC instead if they were ever made, but I mean hey a man can dream right?Don't tell me it wouldn't be the perfect reward for that tower.
334odd	-21921	1429454995	MortalKombat	[REQUEST] Flairs for alternate skins	So in the Kollection in MKX you can view every alternate skin for every character. I know it's alot of work, but it would be awesome if one of the mods around here could make a flair out of each skin. My main reason for requesting this is because I really want the Wrathful Shinnok as my flair. Not a big fan of his main outfit :P (Although I suspect alot more people than just me would be happy to have more flairs).
33pasm	-21921	1429876665	MortalKombat	How do you enter secret room in Krypt?	In the spider caves in the krypt, there is a secret room you can enter using Raidens staff. I was able to enter once but couldn't buy everything in there so now I wanna go back. Problem is, I can't anymore. All that it says when I go to the entrance is 'Nothing can be done here at this time'. Is there a certain condition you have to meet to enter or am I missing something? 
36db74	-21921	1431957616	MortalKombat	Klassic Stage DLC suggestions	Judging by some of [Ed Boons](https://twitter.com/noobde/status/596306545010282496) [tweets](https://twitter.com/noobde/status/600138122836357121), NRS are clearly interested in making some klassic MK stages DLC for MKX. I think this is a great idea, as I feel more stages is the only thing missing to make this game perfect. So now I wanna hear some of your suggestions for klassic stages you want as DLC. Here are some of mine:- Goro's Lair - The Pit X - Kahn's Koliseum - Soul Chamber

I feel like such a dumb for just realizing this. If you fuse a scorpion with something under 0 degrees you don't get a reptile though, so I'm not sure where his name came from. 
3e4bzw	-21921	1437513601	MortalKombat	Hopes for more Klassic Fatalities?

Which klassic fatalities do you wish to see in the future? Im holding out for the epic Quan Chi leg beatdown, might still be one of the best fatalities in MK history.
3fwi6k	-21921	1438797790	skyrimmods	[Help] Song from Falskaar keeps repeating	I've noticed that the Falskaar mod has added a track that for me keeps repeating over and over again as soon as I enter a building or cave, even outside of the Falskaar world space. The same track continues to play in the overworld as well after leaving said building or cave. It is only interrupted by combat music but comes back as soon as combat is over. Anyways to give you an idea of the song it is very calm and has alot of flute-sounds. It's still very annoying though so I would prefer if it was not there. I tried installing some mods that add more music to the game in an attempt to solve this, but as soon as I go inside a building/dungeon this damn tune takes over again. I'm not so good when it comes to modding so I'm asking if there is anyway I can fix this issue or get rid of the song without having to uninstall Falskaar. Would greatly appreciate it if someone could help me fix this, Thanks in advance!

But one of my recent mods (Air Atronach to be exact) has a grey bolt next to it with no additional signs. What does this mean? Would love an answer since the mod isn't really running properly for me. 
3j05p7	-21921	1440971824	MortalKombat	Found some weird connections concerning Tremor's backstory.	Was browsing the MK wiki because I'm a lore buff and found something pretty similar to what is talked about in Tremor's arcade ending. Bear in mind this is non-canon though.So in Tremor's ending, you found out that he went to a Dream Realm where he gained his powers. I stumbled across the page for this guy, [Henge](http://mortalkombat.wikia.com/wiki/Henge), who comes from a non-canon MK comic, and I noticed they share similarities. Henge has the same rocky skin texture that Tremor has, and he comes from the Nightmare realm, pretty similarly to Tremor visiting the Dream Realm.I'm not sure what this all means, maybe NRS is just making some obscure reference, or maybe they are hinting at something for Tremor's backstory. Maybe Henge is the one who gave him his powers? Most likely this is just a coincidence though and it all means nothing, but I do find the similarities interesting.

DO NOT wait for the jungler to just walk into the lane and start the gank, this very rarely works out even if the jungler has big gap closers like Jarvan or Vi. Instead set up the gank by either baiting the enemy to walk closer by missing an ability or go walk closer to the jungle bush, many people at low ranks will take the opportunity to get some damage on you.The other way which works more often is to just go aggressive on the enemy while taking minion aggro, they will often aggressive aswell and then the jungler can swoop in and get the kill.TL:DR SET UP THE GANK FOR THE JUNGLER, DON'T JUST LET HIM GANK

Every now and then i roll with people that have a background in wrestling/kickboxing who don't have the best submission game. They often try to just smash my throat in every way they can, when do i tap to these moves? They usually don't hurt that much and they aren't choking me, but if they put a lot of pressure on my trachea i guess it can collapse. How do i know when to tap to this? Do i go with the heel hook idea of tapping sooner than later or will i feel a lot of pain before my trachea collapses?
356ov6	-21934	1431013197	amateur_boxing	Wrist problems following change in punching mechanics	I used to be a super weak puncher, i would never hurt someone with a punch unless i timed it 100% perfect, hit a big combination or put all my weight into a big overhand. Recently it kind of "clicked" for me, i was watching a tutorial before i hit the bag and a detail he used to describe how to throw the punch made me understand how to be more relaxed and have more snap in all my punches. This made my punching power increase probably 2-3x, especially in my left hook which was really encouraging. My coach noticed and commented on it, i look forward to sparring a lot more now and i've started dropping people with short left hooks and right crosses. The improvement happened like 2 weeks ago and now im having some wrist problems, particularly in my left hand where the power change was the biggest. What can i do about this? Different gloves/wraps, wrist exercises or maybe just wait until it disappears?Help would be great, i can pretty much only throw jabs with my left hand right now and it sucks, im super excited about training  because of the big improvment i've made.

It's kind of making me develop an inferiority complex and makes me feel shitty...I don't know too much about her. I know that her smashes are stupid slow and have long recovery times. I think the jab combo is good for stacking damage. Her uair and nair are nice multihits too. But what about stuff like her tilts? Those are really slow as well. We play completely standard smash, no special move setsAny help would be much appreciatedTL;DR: My brother makes me want to take my 3DS and throw it out the window.

33qpy3	-21950	1429901712	manga	How do you read manga without damaging it? r/manga	I haven't really been a manga reader. The only one I ever finished was Death Note that I borrowed from a library. Though recently after watching Akame Ga Kill! I really wanted to read the manga since I liked the anime so much. So I ordered Vol. 2 and will be picking up Vol. 1 sometime this week.This brings me to my question. How do you read manga without damaging the book (mainly the spine I'm worried about)? I didn't have to worry about this when I borrowed from the library because the books were already trashed. Edit: It has torn pages :C I'll have to get it replaced

My brother has two Tales of series figures from collector's editions and I became interested.I want to buy a figure of Haruna and Kongou from Kantai Collection but since I'm very new to this, I don't know if I should wait for bigger companies to make them or buy them now/on release by smaller companies.From what I understand, GSC and Maxfactory make very good figures, but I'm tempted to get the ones from Ques Q since they actually made Kongou already and have a Haruna in the making. Problem is I heard that there was some scaling issues with their Shimakaze. There's also a Haruna being made by Amakuni that I'm interested in.I have no idea what I should do :S At the very least I just want a Haruna figure, I think I can wait on Kongou, but I'm not sure if any of the bigger companies will make one.Thoughts? Responses are appreciated

I had no idea we had another school newspaper on campus, but this one is centered around politics. Its mission statement is barely coherent, but claims to be encompassing all political views.DAE think some of the articles were one-sided or written with remarkable condescending attitudes? Usage of "liberal media," "socialism," "anti-capitalism," were thrown around &amp; even used incorrectly. I'm not saying that all of the articles lacked credibility or valid points, I'm just wondering if anyone else thought that some of the articles were presented poorly &amp; written without any sort of professionalism.**tl;dr Not sure if college newspaper or FOX news.**

I normally play the Sims with the best morals, ensuring that no one cheats on their spouse &amp; that no fights really ensue (not religious, just not a malevolent player, I suppose). However, I decided to make one of my sims in the Sims 3 homeless &amp; a total lady's man.In this fellow's adventures, he knocked up 5 separate women, 3 of them were married, &amp; on all of the occasions, I made sure that their husbands were home. GREAT SUCCESS. It was incredibly amusing. Lots of fights ensued &amp; all 3 women had children, so their children ended up hating homeless guy for being a life ruiner/homewrecker. So, what's your crazy sim story?

2ltdkl	-21960	1415582811	relationships	My[16M] first Girlfriend [16F] of over half a year left me for my close friend. What should I do and how should I act around them?	Back story: We weren't really an official couple but when everyone at school calls us a couple, we would be fine with it so we just assumed. We were acting like a legit couple anyway. She told me that she didn't want to be in a relationship anymore. After she told to him about that he told her that he likes her after he knew that she was losing feelings for me. He made a move on her. So she left me for him. When she told me that she didn't want to be in a relationship anymore, she was pretty hesitant, and sure enough, after that day we were still acting like a couple. But then yeah.. the guy told her that he likes her so she just left me altogether. She wasn't hesitant anymore because she wasn't going to be alone; she has him. They both betrayed me. I'm too angry at them and I can't forgive them although I know I need to. What should I do? Ignore them? Act like nothing happened? Fake smile?TL;DR: My girl left me for my close friend. They betrayed me both.

2n1gqs	-21960	1416617704	brocourt	My "bro" made a move on my gf 2 days after she broke it off	so me and my girlfriend has been together for 7 months (we're both 16) and well... we weren't really official. Neither of us asked each other out, but everyone in school acknowledged/assumed that we were, so we were like, okay lolso my gf broke it off with me and then two days later, my "bro", which my gf considers her "brother", made a move on her, saying that he likes her.(They actually have started talking when we were 6 months in our unofficial relationship but I thought they just considered themselves as real siblings, because that's what they told me..) Two days after me and my gf broke it off, we were still acting like we were together, despite "breaking it off", she even said that we didn't have to break this off. But then when my bro made a move on her, she just completely broke it off.  My "bro" didn't even mention me that he was having feelings for my unofficial gf. Mind you, he even refers to me as her bf... until he made a move on her, that is. It felt like he was just waiting for us.I don't know how to act around them anymore. I feel betrayed. I didn't think he would do that. I haven't spoken to him in weeks. It hurts to see them together.. doing the same stuff me and her used to do.. we're all even in the same class every day..TL;DR - read title

Sometimes, I find myself saying a lot of "ums" and "like.." and doing a lot of hand gestures, but most of the time, I look down while saying what I want to say, not looking at the person I'm talking to, then looking at them again when I'm awaiting for their response. I know this isn't normal and I need to do something about it.

My sister accidentally left [my piano](http://www.tanderud.se/images/swan/P9160002.JPG) on overnight and when I tried to play it, no sound came out of it. I tried turning it off and on again, unplugging and plugging the piano. Neither worked. Anyone here who has the same piano and has experienced this?

Some extra (probably unnecessary) info:I currently own a 13" Mid 2012 2.9 GHz Intel Core i7 Macbook Pro and I love it, but it under performs on most game (kinda expected though). I made this list of parts on Amazon UK and the total came to £1002, but as this is my first desktop, first gaming and first homemade build, i think I need some guidance. I am fine for all the monitor/keyboard/mouse things and I am looking mainly for advice on if you think this is overkill, or badly priced.

1wotwo	-21968	1391213869	buildapc	[Discussion] Thoughts on using a TV as a monitor?	I have a spare 45" Panasonic TV screen (I know, crazy having one spare) and I'm planning on building a £1200 PC. What I was wondering was if its a good idea to run a PC on a TV, and save a couple hundred quid on buying a monitor. I'd get an extra 20 inches out of it and for the games I like (AC mostly, CoD, BF and the like), bigger is better. Would there be any major issues with doing this?
1y2fhm	-21968	1392567984	buildapcforme	£1300 British Gaming Build	**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible.**Generally, gaming. The games I love are the whole Assassins Creed series, Bioshock, Minecraft (with lots of mods, or just vanilla). Basically large open world games. I also need basic things like internet browsing, space for films and pictures (I'll probably be doing some photoshoppy things in the near future) and all my schoolwork (to last me from now, end of 9th grade or year 10, throughout uni). Overall, simple, common stuff, nothing exeptional.**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?**The absolute max is £1300.**When do you plan on building/buying the PC?**ASAP, within the next week or so.**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? OS, peripherals, wifi, in addition to the tower.**I need an OS (I quite like Win8), a keyboard, mouse and a screen. My brother is going to university in the near future so I will be able to use the 45" TV that he has in his room at the moment, but some people have advised me against it. I am quite happy to use it because it can save me  a couple hundred pounds, so what I'd like is if you could either include the screen in the price or not if you think it would be a good idea to use the TV. I also want an optical drive. It seems that more and more people are excluding this from their builds now.**Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have a Microcenter?**I'm in England, close to London. There is a Maplin and a CEX close to me if that makes a difference.**If reusing any parts (including peripherals), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.**Nope (apart from the TV mentioned earlier).**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?**I do intend to get as much performance out of this as possible, so yes, I will overclock both the CPU and GPU right away. If you think this is a bad idea, let me know.**If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them.**Not really... I'd like to play the games I mentioned earlier as smoothly as possible, but i suppose thats the aim with any gaming rig.**Do you have any specific case preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?**I really want to have a case with a window and i might get some LEDs afterwards. I like the thought of the Corsair 540 Air... It seems nice.**Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?**No.

Hypothetical situation is that you have the two options for free, but you can only have one. Which do you choose?

I go to an MYP school and this year (10th Grade) I have to do a personal project. My idea is to build a case out of wood. I also want to incorporate the glow in the dark resin idea that popped up a couple weeks back. I am relatively new to woodworking, and so i need as much guidance as possible. Things I need to know:* What wood would I use?* Would it be possible to make it thermally efficient?* Would i need to take some parts from the Phantom 410?Any other information you guys could give me would be massively appreciated!
2k0u4a	-21968	1414006746	skyrimmods	/r/skyrimmods, what's your favourite visual mods mix?	I've just made a clean install, and am about to get stuff going. So my question is what is your personal mix of visual mods? everything from textures to ENBs, share your preference, and what sort of look it gives you (realism/fantasy, dark/bright, dull/saturated). I'm looking forward to seeing what you guys use!
2mdlwl	-21968	1416058221	assassinscreed	Installing screen in unity?	What is this screen? I downloaded the game to the point where it said playable, and it is still downloading. I played the first mission (the one up until you get on the video with the girl in the present, trying to keep it as spoiler free as possible), and then I just get this screen. Can I stop it? Its been stuck on 35%, I restarted the game, saw the cut scene, then it came again at 36%.http://imgur.com/H4i56AH

2nysgb	-21968	1417461194	electronics	Can I convert a 30-Pin speaker to an MP3 audio jack?	So a friend is moving to Australia and he gave me a bunch of stuff to play with, including this Bose speaker for an iPod/Phone. the speaker has a 30-Pin but I have an android phone (nexus 5 if you're interested) and a computer with no speakers. my idea was to replace the 30-Pin with a 3.5mm MP3 jack. Can I do this, and if so, how?http://imgur.com/a/T3aOM
2p4644	-21968	1418419896	buildapc	Whats my next move? Got a 770, should I get another or sell it and get a 980?	I recently built a gaming PC with a i7 4770k, 16gb RAM, and a Gigabyte GTX 770 4gb card. I've now saved up a bit and can afford to make an upgrade, but what should it be? Here are what I see my options as, because the 4770k and the 16gb is not my bottleneck I'm pretty sure.- I can buy a second 770 to SLI- I can sell my current 770 to get a 980 or another stronger cardSome other notes: its a 750 watt PSU, and the Mono supports SLI and crossfireSo what do you think my best option is?
2r10dj	-21968	1420140615	assassinscreed	How much customisation cam we get in an AC game?	I've been thinking about the customisation that was given in Unity and how lacking it was. There was a few different sets, and then different levels of each set, all getting slightly better each time. For me, that wasn't enough, and it felt like Ubisoft was just using it to say "look at this seamless feature". What I really want is something like Skyrim, where I can make my assassin look and play how I want them to. I know that it would need more restriction because of the nature of the storyline and the question system, but I can dream, can't I?P.S. whatever happened to shops? When I buy something in Unity, I get it magically... Breaks my immersion a lot.

2szo3k	-21968	1421710261	skyrimmods	How easy would it be for a new modder to create a mod that adds a faction of 4 or 5 completely new NPCs?	I was thinking about my next playthrough and I looked at the sort of group that they would interact with. As a bit of a barbarian who isn't really into the "honour and glory" of the companions, there isn't a great faction that he could join and fit in with. This got me thinking that it would be a good long term project that I could get into, creating a mod that makes a HQ, the NPCs and a small little questline. I have almost 0 experience with creating mods, and I have pretty crazy ambitions for it. also, would it be possible to take some follower mods and just turn them into members of the guild? I think some of the followers like Valfar and Hoth would be perfect for a sort of battle-worn, armoured in hides and skulls, smashing things under hammers sort of guild. So where do I start, and can I put other mod's NPCs into my guild?
2z49va	-21968	1426423328	Luthier	I cant get a sound from my tele, please help me if you can!	I've spent the the last few weeks working on my first guitar, and today I need to finish it. Everything is ready to go, appart from the wiring and then putting it all together. So I do all of the wiring from [this](http://edsguitarlounge.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/standard_tele.jpg) diagram, and haven't had any problems with it until i put in the jack, try and get a sound from the picups, and nothing comes out. I've tryed switching the capacitor around, but that didnt work and now I am truly stumped. [I took some pictures](http://imgur.com/a/zFhE4), but they are pretty crappy quality.Seriously, any help at all would be great to help me get this guitar working.Edit: solved the problem, turns out I had some wires crossed and on the wrong way on the jack, so its all working now :)

2zx7v0	-21968	1427046700	skyrimmods	[Discussion] How would you guys feel about a mod that adds another guild for higher leveled players?	I'm currently making my first mod. It's going to be a new very small guild (3-4 members, + dragonborn) that only accepts the best of the best. Here are some of my ideas so far: - 3 members of the guild, one thief, one mage, and one warrior - Each one is a master in their field, each being stronger than most enemies in Skyrim - The Dragonborn must be the leader of at least one guild, must have completed the main questline, and must meet a minimum level requirement to begin the questline for the guild - [insert supercool quests that help each member of the guild] - Once you're in, you can have each member as a followerIt will take me a long time to get there, but the mod will be finished sometime in the future. I just wanted to check if you have any ideas on the storylines of the 3 members or have any ideas for the questline. It would be good to just get a feel for what you guys think of a mod like this, that adds content to the later game. So... Any ideas?Edit: I want to thank everyone for their thoughts, especially /u/Jack_Hat for his dragon hunter idea. Something like an old member of the blades gone into hiding for the thief, an ex-stormcloak nord who disagreed with how Ulfric was handling things (being too much of a politician) as an axe wielding warrior, and one of Neloth's old apprentices who "experimented" too much for old Neloth as the mage. How does that sound? If you have any more suggestions, feel free to PM me with your ideas.

3ac4t2	-21968	1434665609	Luthier	Does this make sense? I want to build a thru-neck thinline tele with LP electronics	I am thinking about my second guitar build and this is what I have come up with:A tele shaped body, hollowed out like the thinline ones with an F hole. Using mahogany for the back, something like rosewood for the top. I want to buy a pre-made thru-neck from Stew Mac (I live in the UK, not sure where to get something closer to home). I already have 2 teles, and I love the body shape, but I want to mix it up a little, so I am thinking of going on the route of a Les Paul. I don't have any guitars with humbuckers, so its something I want to give a go.I'm sure most of you have bucketloads more experience than I do (1 really shitty build) so do you see any flaws or have any comments? Advice on wood choice, where to get a good neck in the uk or advice on pickups would be appreciated.

1860e9	-21969	1360371236	childfree	Babies and "Miracles"	I posted on FB recently my opinion on when people call having a baby a miracle:"I honestly don't understand why people say having a baby is a "miracle." I mean, I understand why they're happy about it, but it's not really a miracle. A miracle is something that happens for no reason and a rare occurrence. Having a baby is just a biological process that can be done by all living creatures."I had one mom say how it feels miraculous to have another human moving inside of you (eeew!).  Another who I've known since I was a kid said she agreed with me for the most part but for the last thing.  My reply was:"I just personally have a hard time seeing why having a baby is special. I'm happy for those who are happy to have them, but to me it's just another normal thing just about anyone with working parts can do but I'm not interested in participating in myself."I'm curious to find out the fellow CFBCer's opinions.  What do you think of calling having a baby a "miracle"?

I am going to a North Coast aftershow, but I figure it would be similar to one for lolla.  The doors open at 9 and I am not sure what time it will get out, but my guess is after the final train leaves union station.  The show is at the congress, and it normally takes awhile and a bit of walking to find a cab.  I would think ordering a town car or something would be cheaper then getting a city cab home to the burbs.  Does anyone have an suggestions on ways to get back or car companies?
