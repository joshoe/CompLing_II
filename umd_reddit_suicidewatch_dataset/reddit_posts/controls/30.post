1m6mmi	-58003	1378916561	keto	Obsessing over scale	I'm officially going from lurker to poster...I've adapted the new eating habits of a keto/paleo diet. I'm loving it. I've lost 16lbs in the last two weeks and I feel amazing. Regardless of my recent success and all around good-feeling-ness, I keep catching myself obsessing over weighing myself. I check the scale at least once a day (some days much, much more). Does anyone have any tips to curb the obsession?

I maintained a habitual (albeit obsessive) food tracking ritual with MyFitnessPal months ago and have been steadily losing weight. With the redesign of the iOS app last month I slowly stopped using the service and have stayed at the same weight for a month.That's fine. I'm more than happy to be the same weight from Thanksgiving to Christmas, as long as I'm not gaining, I'm happy. While I'm happy to have maintained my weight for the last month, I need to hop back on the loser-express train and get to shedding more pounds.I hit a mental block with the MFP changes because it became more work to find my ratios and remaining specifics (carbs, fat, protein). I usually use MFP on the go, and what was once a quick look at the screen to see where I was at for the day is now a swipe, reload, and a few clicks now.I'm fully aware that this is a first world problem. Again... I REALIZE THIS IS A FIRST WORLD PROBLEM. I'm not looking for sympathy, or a shoulder to cry on, or for this app to change. And I'm certainly not looking for an MFP fan-girl to tell me I'm nuts for not wanting to use this app anymore.What I AM looking for is an alternative to MFP. I value minimalism, simplicity, and a quality working app. I feel like I've lost this with MFP and my simple one screen check. Does anyone have a suggestion for a simple iOS MFP alternative?

A paleo friend of mine has recently been informed that her children's daycare, in an effort to fight peanut allergies, is no longer allowing any form of tree nuts in children's food. (Yes, we're painfully aware of the difference between peanuts and tree nuts, but sadly, her daycare is not.)This means she can no longer use almond or coconut flour in her son's lunch. Of course, being a paleo parent and relying on these flours for breaded chicken/fish and other dishes, she's at a loss.Does anyone have any experience with other paleo-friendly non-tree-nut flours?

t2rof	-58049	1335931773	DeepSpaceNine	Just watched 0409 - "Our Man Bashir" for the first time (spoilers)	It's my first time through the series (thanks to netflix), and even though I'm craving Dominion War exposition, this was a pretty good 'filler' episode.  At least, much better than the slap-stick "Little Green Men."  Julian Bashir, Secret Agent is an excellent look for the doctor.  For some reason him brandishing pistols and martinis was somewhat pimpin.  Anytime they sex Kira up a little bit is fine by me.  Hell, the role Dax inhabited as the ditzy "scientist" was better suited for Terry Farrell than the real scientist she normally plays. Sisko as a villian effing ruled.But my favorite part was, naturally, Garek's observations as a real deal no-shit spy.  And the way he passive-aggressively indulged Bashir's fantasies.  Goddamn it, I just love Garek so so much.  The end where they were hinting at possible future adventures as spy buddies was especially titillating.  But, once again, not as titillating as Kira with a cheesy Soviet accent.Just stray observations.  There was a specific moment when this show became everything I love about Star Trek, and I'm stoked to see the subreddit is quite active.Sub-self.post:  How many people are watching DS9 for the first time thanks to Netflix?  God bless 'em.

x04ck	-58049	1343022062	TrueBlood	Absolute Unconditional Love	This must have been how it felt when comic book readers fell in love with the Joker.  I fell for Mark Hamill's Joker from Batman: The Animated Series.   Heath Ledger's is the best live action, and if you say differently you're a snob with a head up your ass, probably yours.This must have been how it felt when seeing Henry Gale slowly reveal himself to be the dastardly Ben Linus when LOST was doing its thing in real time.  If you've never seen LOST, watch up until season six and write your own ending where Ben wins the island and flies away on a dinosaur.  I didn't think that I'd ever find a villain I love as much as I love the Joker.  Ben Linus made a compelling case, until a polar bear cut his balls off.  (sorry, spoilers.)Russell Edgington is not only the former King Of Mississippi, he's currently the King of my Heart Kingdom.  To see him week-to-week is so titillating. To hear him speak is a symphony of insane and righteous violence.  Even hearing other characters talk about him carries a mystique of holy fuck danger to Earth-kind.  I'm not spoiling any details by saying that this season has taken on a much more heightened comic-book-y vibe.  Russell Edgington might eventually be the greatest.  But from the moment he ripped a spine out on TV, I just wanted to see him all I could and spend all my time with him and maybe get to know him more.TL;DRI'm in love with Russell Edgington.

Neil Gaiman is truly a genius, and this is a humbling work of literature that it will take me a while to recover from reading.  As a writer, it makes me want to give up altogether.  I'm sure in the coming weeks/months/years I'll have plenty more that I'll want to say about it, but right now I'm having a problem internalizing my feelings for this story.  I'd like to find some *good* literary essays on the subject.  I'm sure I'll find some on this sub, but if there are any suggestions from my fellow dreamers, please let me know.  TL;DRI just finished the Sandman, and it unsurprisingly fucked my shit right up.

I myself didn't mind them until someone pointed out their similarities to SW Storm Trooper helmets, and once I saw it...But this thought just struck me: At this point in the original timeline the Klingons were suffering from a virus that made their cranial ridges dissolve and brought a long period of shame to the Empire.  So what if in the JJverse they're wearing the helmets to compensate for their "deformity" / hide their shame?  It's a symbolic nod to their heritage that they've felt they've lost due to their tampering with their own genetics.  This of course ties in the pre-JJverse Enterprise episode that explains why the TOS Klingons looked different from any of the other iterations.

I say event, it was ~45 passionate nerds arguing over starship supremacy using a tournament bracket and polite and mostly-civilized discourse.  My then-fiance (now wife) and I were passionately championing the *USS Defiant*.  It was eventually thwarted by the Death Star, which went on to lose the to the Doomsday Machine from TOS.  It was an epic argument that left even the losers extremely satisfied.  [Here's the entire bracket after last year's smackdown.](http://i.imgur.com/AHBNJq8.jpg) * Questions:1. Were there any other redditors there?2. Any idea whether or not they're doing it this year, and if not why?3. If they aren't going to do it, who would be interested in attending/participating/helping organize one?  PM me or comment.  but I need answers and I need my StarShip Smackdown!

I mean the prices for mats might be inflated due to legacy players having so much more gil, and likewise by the time I fully level my crafting skills will the market already be flooded with end game crafts?So as a new player on a legacy server, should I even bother sinking gil and time into a crafting job?

1lbjhw	-58052	1377767505	elderscrollsonline	Why is it "OK" to have cosmetic items in a cash shop?	I keep seeing people saying a cash shop is "ok" if it's not pay to win and purely cosmetic. I've noticed this as justification for having one, but have your ever considered this. This is an MMO, you cannot "Win" it...it will continue on and on because that's how MMOs are made. Now I realize some of you only think about the numbers and stats when you think of the best gear, but is it wrong to assume that for quite alot of people out there "winning" is making their character look as awesome as possible? I'm asking this to you all because I have a problem with cash shops in general unless they only do things like server transfers and name/body changes. To me and alot of other people...throwing up a shiny new costume skins on the cash shop that I can't spend in game time trying to get is BS....especially with a monthly fee attached that should be getting me all the "extra"content in the game until expansion time. (which I fully support and am glad ESO is doing so long as they deliver the content accordingly)So for some of us those cosmetics are "pay-to-win" items. Just something for thought. I'm sure some of you have different opinions but please don't argue here as the definition of winning an MMO is open-ended at best. What I want to know is everyones opinions on that, why you think it's ok or why not. I just want to speak up since the cash shop can still easily change before launch and many people are likely to feel the same as I do.

1m0wvy	-58052	1378720696	elderscrollsonline	My take on a working bounty system~needs feedback/if its good, suggest it on beta forums!	Let me know what you think!* Here's an idea, have bounties randomly assigned and opted for. It stops all forms of abuse. All people who stole/murder (and got caught in the act) gets his/her name thrown into a virtual hat, then one person initiates the bounty from a bounty board. One bounty hunter/assassin assigned to one criminal randomly to avoid abuse! Key word is random to prevent player exploiting friends/guildies/second accounts.* Then you could pay or bribe NPCs for information on the assigned targets location (by current zone, optional gold sink to be a risk/reward balancer to avoid too much income from this unless you get lucky to know which zone they are in).It would also be easy to have NPC's tell you the location of players. It would have to be passed to you by note or letter to avoid saying player names in voice acting, so it wouldn't even break immersion.* You will also be reassigned a new bounty instantly if the target logs off to prevent the annoyance of going back to the board(notified via text on screen and quest update). * If the criminal/hunter shuts their client down, their character should remain in the world long enough to kill if they are in combat already to prevent people from logging off and stopping the hunter from killing them if they are losing.* When you see them you are both attackable to each other (so they would glow red to you and you only) and you fight. The persons could die and lose all stolen goods/ equal gold value of sold or used stolen goods/fail the bounty contract(to which the target can either clear their name or get it thrown back into the hat until a specified amount of time passes based on the bounty amount, so to keep big winnings you have to survive longer and the hunter would have to re-apply for a bounty at a loss of time and possibly gold). * When targets enter AvA the bounty should be removed until they exit however to prevent in-fighting while on the battlefield...helping your alliance could also decrease the amount of your bounty or atleast the time it happens to be on your head.* Could also make a hunter/criminal skill tree....this could also work with the dark brotherhood later on and the Emperor in Cyrodiil at the time could be a constant target in AvA for the top teir hunters/assassins and have a bonus/acheivement attached to it for killing them.With this system, players will actually care about bounties on them because they could lose what they gained. Like wise the hunters need to invest time/gold on location information to get their prize. I don't see exploits happening with this system. It could really take some community involvement for big bounties. So please, try and find a reason this would not work and try to find an exploit. I want this suggested on the forums if it turns out to be good and will edit this post based on feedback from you guys!
1m0z2t	-58052	1378724673	elderscrollsonline	Would like to thank ZoS for stress testing early!	Here we are stress testing a game that's not even due to release until next year, this needs to happen more times than not. EX:FF14, a few stress tests right before launch=half their customers can't even play the game. Diablo 3=error 37 troubles for weeks on end.   Simcity=server full. These games despite being good IMO have had crap launches due to server limitations and problems and MMOs ALWAYS suffer from server issues upon launch...the key is the be prepared. ZoS is doing well by doing these tests early and letting people in. The more the better.

28kl10	-58052	1403201698	DestinyTheGame	PSA~to the right of this page is a link to the feedback website.	USE IT! I see lots of great ideas coming from you guys but reddit isn't the place to suggest things to the devs. Use their forums and get your ideas straight to the source.  Yes I know Deej comes here sometimes but I don't think he has time to read every thread here and on other websites too.
29gsoe	-58052	1404129423	DestinyTheGame	Anything for forge and custom games?	lets be honest,  it gave halo that infinite replayability...now we have next gen systems with 8Gb ram instead of a measly 256. It would be a sin to not include a map editor and customs games with all the power we have at our fingertips now!
29h2c6	-58052	1404137733	DestinyTheGame	HMGs feel a little underpowered compared to other weapons?	yeh I know the cap was 8 and it was alpha, but guns should scale throughout the experience well. I felt HMGs were a waste of heavy ammo with a lower crit damage than a primary auto rifle and worthless accuracy. Absolutely no reason to use this gun type especially when I'd have to sacrifice a rocket launcher for it.  This is in my pvp and pve experience in alpha. Anyone feel the same?EDIT: after reading posts and watching a video it turns out that most HMGs melt face....mine was just about as effective as a pellet gun with a super fast fire rate....so an SMG lol   Thanks for the posts guys
2a02lx	-58052	1404687428	DestinyTheGame	Grimoire score achievement~ problem?	Noticed that there is a Grimoire achievement called "lucky 7s" It requires you to get a Grimoire score of 777 to complete. Now...since grimoire scores are account bound... Does this mean you could potentially miss the achievement forever if you skip over the number 777?   
2a6gy4	-58052	1404854059	DestinyTheGame	Remember in Alpha where brave and legend were the two difficulties?	http://i4.minus.com/i7mkq4ZnMI37k.pngWell get ready to noob it up, there is also an easy difficulty now for people new to FPS games. First time I've seen it confirmed.Easy, Brave, Legend....BECOME IT!
2b98gm	-58052	1405906089	DestinyTheGame	The interceptors....are power weapons...and they have counters.	Yes, controlling them can control the outside of "FIRST LIGHT" Yes, they hurt.Yes, they are hard to kill.No, they are not the end all to the map.No, they are not invincible.Yes, I'm sure alot of people will still QQ because they can't 1V1 the damn things without a super in open ground. Continuously whining about how their lack of teamwork and strategy always fails when bumrushing the damn things. Stop whining....gang up on them and shoot the pilot, use pulse grenades or the like when they are in confined areas, get on the turrets BEFORE you see them, use your super, out pilot the guy in another interceptor, out pilot the guy in a very fast pike, focus fire the thing from multiple angles and when they look at you get behind cover, avoid them by using the buildings, jump on their heads and literally PUNCH THE PILOT OUT AND STEAL THE THING FOR YOURSELF.   I love how all the MLG pro kiddies are whining because they can't out pulse rifle the damn things....this is hilarious....hilariously sad that what is supposed to be a tank is not worthy of being a little OP in the eyes of players nowadays.   BY ALL MEANS, NERF IT, NERF IT UNTIL IT HAS THE HEALTH OF A SPARROW AND THE POWER OF A STAPLE GUN. Until that happens people will whine and fail hard./end rantTLDR; Stop bitching about how a power weapon that is a TANK...is OP.    That's the F'ing point!
2bhm0a	-58052	1406117907	DestinyTheGame	Supers are OP and situational. Bringing balance and diversity.	I'm here to attempt to quell more "whining of OP"I see alot of you complaining that Titans have a better super than anyone else....wrong. They have a better super for the crucible's "control" game type that we've gotten to play. This is because we are stuck trying to cap points in a circle that has a smaller radius than the blast of Fists of Havoc. The titan being the "tanky" class can get into range and use this easily if you don't move out of the circle.But!  Every class has situations that they excel at.Titans: As above, any confined space or capture point objective.Hunters: The only class that can snipe with their Super, Ranged 1 hit KOs, better for taking out those pesky intercepters and supercharged Titans without putting you into the " Danger zone"Warlock: A clear balance of the two, mixing AOE with range capability but sacrificing a little power from both sides.Most importantly remember, Supers are OP...they are meant to be after all. But it is balanced because everyone has them, just know that not every situation will fit their usefulness. Keep that in mind while playing game modes in crucible...and if you want the advantage...choose a game mode that fits you. 
2bqmkv	-58052	1406332868	DestinyTheGame	Does RNG harm our ability to become legend?	Just curious what you think, seems like its all up to luck...no loot is gotten through skill with the banner loot being random as well as the dropped loot.
2c5ez4	-58052	1406735808	DestinyTheGame	trueskill matchmaking from halo 2	why Is this still not a thing? best system ever that put you up against people at your level of play. encouraged competition and ensured new players or less skilled players didn't get rofl stomped by vets all the time.

2cjmmu	-58052	1407112749	DestinyTheGame	Medals screen at the end of matches?	Anyone think that medals should play a role in the after game screens?  Having to go to Bungie.net or the app to see it shouldn't be the way to display these things, show the people what they got on screen.
2cmtbx	-58052	1407192446	DestinyTheGame	Titan Lightbringer	Well I figured I'd pass the time with a build. This tree: http://www.destinydb.com/calculator/talents#MMLcZHZ8yK708yH708yT708yQ708yy708yB708yW708yY708ye708y4708yZ708yx7With these items:http://destinydb.info/inventory/item/2272644374 Alpha lupihttp://destinydb.info/inventory/item/119482464  Hard light+ any other non-exotic items that benefit auto rifles, melee recharges, and supers.Basically it goes like this:"Ward of Dawn" is activated which creates light orbs, and additional light orbs thanks to Alpha Lupi's "keeper of the pack". Thanks to "Gift of the Void" your Ward also creates more light orbs as it takes fire.(it is unknown if Alpha Lupi would also increase this...but damn that would be ball'n)Ward also has the "Armor of light" passive making your team within stupid hard to kill. Which is great because you'll be chaining off their supers.Now with the "gift of light" passive under disintegrate, all kills while the force barrier is active have a chance to create light orbs as well. This is a good combo with "Hardlight" which over penetrates and ricochets off hard surfaces and has 60 rounds in the magazine, making room clearing a light factory.Now you'll notice I chose "untouchable" over "Iron harvest".The reason for this is heavy ammo is hard to come by or atleast not reliable and the sooner I can activate my Ward again, the more light I can reliably generate and the safer my fireteam is.  With all this light generation, your team can simply super everything to death if they stay nearby, be safe in your warded area, and generate more light for you to use Ward again very soon afterwards.The MOST important thing to this build, IS YOUR FIRE TEAM! Without them, all these orbs are useless to you alone. Protect them Titans!This build is ofcourse more of a PVE build as you will rely mostly on lots of enemies to kill to keep Ward up and running, though some smaller maps with defense based gametypes would also benefit greatly from this.

So let me give some advice before we rape server 6 again tonight. People use no natural terrain to their benefit and openings everywhere for me to hack my way in with a pick axe or airdrop through the roof.Atleast use the metal you do have to make an iron core room instead of covering a minor area of your external defense with it. Keep your nice loot in that room and upgrade the external defense last. Otherwise I'll keep sneaking in an stealing your resources, trashing the rest, and you will never have enough to fortify your outer defense. TLDR; think about your base design when using precious metal, I'm trying to help you.

Hi, you know what its like, you agree to do something for someone because your the 'guy who knows computers' and before you know it your doing much more than you intended, well, I initially got volunteered by my team to update the website, I have done this for a year, but it its driving me insane, I have no idea what the CMS is but its terrible, so anyway, I have taken it upon myself to take us to wordpress, the problem I have is getting it to be feature equal to the existing site. Currently there is some stats package on the site which I believe allows the guy who does the stats to upload them from a pda (seriously, this thing is antique) and they show up on the site.What I am trying to discover is, does anyone know a plug-in or something to do a similar kind of thing for a wordpress site, I'm not looking for the PDA aspect, working on a mobile through safari/chrome would be ideal, but whatever, just not having to manually just edit in pure text, I am doing this for a British American Football team so our resources are extremely limited, but everyones desire for extreme levels of stats is high, so I know that if I can't find a solution for this issue, I am never going to get the nod to take my wordpress creation live.I have got league manager and project manager taking care of the leagues and the roster and some things I have read make reference to project manager being able to do stats, but, though I am an enthusiastic amature, my skills lay in photoshop and talking crap, not so much php and mysql so its a bit over my head.So anyway, I think I have made a bad enough job of explaining what I am trying to find out, and if any of you guys can help me I will be super thankful for your input.
1th18d	-58056	1387737538	startups	How do you mitigate the risk of a bigger company just copying/ripping your idea off?	I have an idea, but I have a problem, I think it could be hitting a relatively untapped niche in a market thats dominated in the UK by a couple of big players, I think it could potentially live in parallel to these businesses and not impact them, in fact, depending on their willingness to be partners, it could be mutually beneficial to them and I. That said, it hasn't escaped me that being as the idea would be largely web based, and that they are already web based, that they could just take my idea, replicate it, market it more aggressively and call upon their large userbase already to be able to charge less and thus crush my company. The problem I have is, is that I don't think they would be motivated to hit this gap in the market unless they perceived someone to be filling it and making money that they were missing out on.What steps do you guys recommend to prevent this from happening to you? I am enthusiastic as to a) the space in the market being there to implement my solution and b) my ability to at least build a 'mk1' version of the site/app - I just don't want to invest the required cash and effort into it if there is little I can do to prevent my investment simply acting as a proof of concept for a bigger company to just rip off.I appreciate that starting any business is a risk, and I don't worry about that, I am more interested if there are any ways to make it harder for someone to pillage your idea, or is it a case that the best defence is offence and just make it, and run with it and hope that I can get something cranking before a big player tries to replicate me?I am a little jittery because I have been wanting to start my own business for ages but am massively self critical and finally think I have an idea that satisfies my own criticisms and am actually pretty excited to have a shot doing something, but the last little doubts of how to get going still linger and I don't want to end up with large quantities of egg on my face and a load of people labelling me a naive dreamer if it all goes wrong.
27dl22	-58056	1401971655	ios	How to use AirPlay on iOS 8 Beta? (and does it work?)	Hey, firstly, I have searched this so if I have repeated someone else's post, I apologise - I also looked through a few pages.I have iOS8 on my iPhone 5 and iPad 2, they both seem to be working largely fine (other than whatsapp damnit) - however the one thing that I can't do that I do normally do quite a lot is AirPlay, normally an AirPlay button comes up in the 'system tray' on a flick up from the bottom, splitting the AirDrop button in two, you press it and then your displayed all the AirPlay options (of which there are about 50 in my building) - currently though, neither my iPad nor my iPhone can evidently see any of the available AirPlay Recievers on my network (other iOS 7 devices can see them so they are there), now, I remember when iOS7 came out they changed the way you connect to AirPlay which bamboozled my little brain for a bit, I am just wondering if they have moved it's location again, and that it IS actually working, or if its simply not working with iOS8 and my environment (its a school btw).I did try googling it, obviously, but if you type iOS 8 and AirPlay into google, its ALL about the peer to peer possibilities of iOS 8 rather than if its useage has actually changed.Any thoughts?Cheers bros and broettes
2c1faa	-58056	1406639241	ios	DEP - is there a way to 'get' it in the UK?	Hi all,I am the manager of a network in the UK and we have over 1200 iPads, we collected them all in and are checking, repairing etc them over the holidays, now because this will be their fourth year in the wild they were kind of in different stages of 'enrolledness' into Meraki, our MDM of choice, simply because when we first started off in this endeavour, the options were not as they are now, and as things have developed we have tried to roll with the punches. Now, what frustrates us is, that apple normally launches things in september, the month AFTER the summer holidays, it also seems to treat us Brits like the poor cousin who gets to nibble on the crusts after America has had their fill (at least when it comes to things like VPP and DEP and the bulk Apple ID creation) - imagine the frustration of seeing these services from accross the pond, all the time thinking we could make massive use of them. Now I appreciate VPP kind of required a bit of localisation work as far as licenceing deals and stuff with the app creators, but DEP? seriously? why can't I use this now? I NEED it. We are currently messing around enrolling 1200 devices manually, fully aware that if iOS8 goes down in the same manner that iOS7 did, that the profiles and the work that we are putting in on them, will potentially be disappeared as soon as the kids update to iOS8. Failing that, its annoying that the kids can just remove the profiles anyway, however, with DEP we could make it so they couldn't do that and THAT is what we want to do (being able to bulk make the apple ID's would be sweet too).What I am asking really is, does anyone know if there is a way for us to... hmmm... bend things so that we can use DEP now? you know, in a similar way that you can change your DNS and get American Netflix? I don't really want to do things counter to Apple's wishes, but damn son, throw me a bone over hear!We are literally about 75 iPads into the job and about ready to kill ourselves with boredom, any ideas would be greatly received.Thanks

2jrz49	-58056	1413805792	macserver	App Caching Server - does anyone use this?	Hi All,I work at a school where we have over a thousand iPads and a couple of macs etc, every time there is a new iOS update or we push an app like Word or whatever, the load that it put on our connection (100mb fibre) is excessive, so I implemented the app caching functionality on our mac mini server. Thats great, but I find the documentation for the App Caching to be super awkward to come by and when I do, not really very good. I am part of a larger school community who use a council based ISP, initially, the app caching server (admitedly not mine) was running and everyone in like 900+ schools was trying to download apps from that one site ( you can imagine that that guy's server would have been having a melt down ) - I managed to find out how to limit its listening range and since then it has worked pretty well - the new server app makes THAT side of things MUCH better as you don't have to mess about with the text files. One of the main gripes that I have is that it doesn't seem to operate a first in first out attitude to the apps that it caches, or even better, a 'least used' first out. It seems to just fill up (its literally caching 500gb of apps for me now, loads of which will be numerous different iOS8 / 8.0.2 / and their respective updates for apps ) and then your only recourse is to 'reset' it, which means downloading all that stuff again? surely this should be fluid and just cache things that are of use, or allow us to go through and delete specific apps / updates whatever to manage the space?Its like, so close to being what would be ideal, but that one aspect really bothers me as it seems like it would be relatively easy to fix.Further to that, if you could make the server pre-emptively download 'OS' and 'app' updates for specific devices / apps in the evening, it would make it smooth out the delivery of these when all the kids got in in the morning - so for example, have a check list of apps that you already cache, and then tick it so that should an update become available, it instantly downloads the update for that app (for the devices you specify) and has it ready to go at the next possible opportunity. That may be a little optimistic, but that would make the caching server much more useful to me.Any thoughts / tips you guys have around this?CheersChaz
2sidlo	-58056	1421326193	ios	Is it possible to go from 7.1.2 to 8.1.2 OTA?	I have a roll out of over a thousand iPad 2/4 and I am having a major issue with the kids not being able to update their iPads form 7.1.2 to the current iOS, it just errors out.I am confused as it lets them go to the upgrade software bit and we make sure that they have the required space on their device (this is the main reason they didn't update them in the first place, they obviously NEED all those selfies and videos of absolute rubbish).Because of the number of devices, updating them by plugging them in etc is a real problem, and because of the diverse nature of our students, a computer at home / broadband, is not necessarily and expectation so we really need to sort this in house.Am I missing an obvious trick here or is it actually impossible to update to the current iOS from 7.1.2?Thanks for any help / suggestions

2egmim	-58062	1408905023	Guitar	Choosing my new amp head. Orange CR120 vs Tiny Terror.	Hey there guys! I'm choosing a new amp head for gigging, but i'm on a bit of a tight budget of £300-£350 ($500-$600). So far I've decided on either the Orange CR120, or the Orange Tiny Terror.Now, I am a fan of valve amps, but I also love solid state amps.The only thing I dislike about the Tiny Terror head is the lack of EQ (other than the single tone knob). I love the sound of it.The CR 120 on the other hand, I love. The analogue sound, the digital reverb. The clean channel also has that crunch I love when you really drive it. The only concern was that it was a bit flat at the high end, but with the distortion pedal I use, that will not be a problem to fix, as the pedal has an onboard 3 band EQ with many different settings.Most people would say that valve wins every time, but this is very close in my opinion.Keep in mind:Orange CR120 (Solid State 120W £300/$500Orange Tiny Terror (Valve/Tube 15W £370/$615Thanks in advance guys!

As far as I know this amp is a hybrid, with a single tube in the pre-amp section.My cab is elsewhere at the moment, so I don't have a cab to test it with, but I used the amps "Emulated DI" jack and headphone jack. There is a very very tiny amount of signal coming out, but it is barely audible. The dude who sold it said that there might be a problem with where the tube connects to the board (Again, I know nothing about amps), although the tube still glows.Does anyone know of some common problems with these amps and could help me out?

Recently though, it has started giving me a very strange problem. Occasionally the amp will cut out, and no sound from my guitar will come out, although sound from the "CD In" jack will still come out.I'm not sure if this will have something to do with the preamp (I know very little about amplifiers), as the small green and red lights for each channel will not light up when the amp cuts out. It will then function as normal again at any random time.You can see the channel lights (I don't know their actual name) here: http://imgur.com/a/AFHqAAny help to figure out what is causing this would be much appreciated! :)

I then came across the POD on a used instrument sale page, and I snagged it for £100. I then waited for months and months for a cabinet that would be suited to the AVT to be posted, until I seen the actual matched cabinet for the AVT go on sale for £50. I contacted the dude selling it immediately.

3fnyec	-58062	1438635239	Guitar	Strange amp problem.	Hey there guys. I've been having some issues with an amplifier recently, and was wondering if anyone could help diagnose the issue as it is very strange and I haven't been able to find any simillar cases online.The amp I use is a Marshall AVT50H (hybrid amp, single pre-amp tube with SS power section), with the matching AVT4x12 cabinet, as i'm on a very tight budget.Now, recently when I have switched on the amp, sometimes the channel lights do not come on (the green and red LED that show whether I'm on clean/dirty, i'm not sure of the actual term), and no sound comes from the cabinet. To fix this, I open up the amp and remove the tube, then place it in again, start up the amp and 50% of the time it works again.After being powered on for a while (varies from 30 seconds, up to half an hour), the channel lights will go off, and the speakers will start to scream, and it's not feedback. It's a very horrible, high pitched tone. The volume doesn't affect this tone. Even when the volume and gain are both at 0 on both channels, the squealing will continue at a deafening volume.Again to fix this, I just turn it off, remove the tube, and place it in again. I have tried a new tube, with no improvement.Any ideas guys?TL;DR - Amp cuts out. Loud squealing noise till I jiggle the tube around (this works 50% of the time).  Rinse and repeat.

Has anyone ever wondered if there is a "natural" number system in which constants begin form a logical pattern (random example being base 650, unit of measurement based on the size of an electron, energy based on the energy of a photon at a specific wavelength)It just seems that if everything is connected there must be some number system other than our arbitrary one that makes more sense of it and maybe even help us understand the universe better.Sorry if this is a dumb question.

Well the other night she comes over to watch american idol (yeah whatever fuck you).  Things are going good when, out of nowhere, she lets out a massive fart.  She instantly turns bright red and kind of curls up in a ball on my bed.  I'm trying not to laugh but I start chuckling a little.  She lays there motionless for maybe 5 minutes.  I try and tell her it's not a big deal but I don't think it's doing much good. She finally says she has to go and leaves.  She texts me later saying that was the most embarrassing thing that has happened to her in a long time and that she doesn't think her pride could handle seeing me again.  Hopefully it goes better with the next person I meet.edit:  Called her back, we are going out again this week. 
fqgrf	-58064	1298401823	relationship_advice	I'm assuming I'll regret it so I'm asking you, is this girl crazy?	This past summer I started working with a girl who is pretty cute.  I decide to hit her up after a few weeks and get her number.  We text a little back and forth that day and she invites me to a "party" that night.  A little quick, but I'm up for it.In my experience cute girls usually have good parties so I invite a friend thinking it will be a good time.  Unfortunately, when we get there it is just her and two really fat friends.  My friend makes a quick exit.  My coworker starts feeding me shots on I get hammered pretty quick.  We make out for awhile and then she starts acting weird.She begins randomly poring drinks on me. I was wearing a white shirt and I'm in great shape so I figured she was going for the wet-t look, so I forgave it.   She then disappears a few minutes later.  We eventually find her sitting in a closet not speaking so we go back out to the living room and I talk to her friends.  This is when I started getting worried.Her friends start acting really rude to me so I call them out on it.  They tell me that they don't like the way I treat their friend.  This was a huge WTF moment for me as I talked to her for the first time earlier that day and this was the first night I had ever hung out with her and I had been nothing but a nice guy despite some pretty shitty behavior on her part.  I ask her friends what the hell they are talking about and here is what they told me SHE has said about me.She had been telling them that we've been seeing each other for several weeks (I'm assuming from about the time she got hired) and that on several occasions I had received calls from my X while with her and had left to see the X.  Obviously I'm in shock for a couple reasons.  I hadn't talked to my X since we broke up several months ago and that that night was the first and only time I had ever seen her.  Her friends get an "oh shit" face.  They say that they believe me and tell me that she was in the military and was discharged for making up stories about a superior officer abusing her.  I leave pretty quickly after that. The next day she texts me asking if I like her.  I explain I don't know her and that I couldn't answer that without knowing her better.  Her friends come in and tell me some more crazy shit about her.  I leave it at that but about a week later one of the friends, the one that told me most of the stuff, actually asked me out on a date.  It was along the lines of (your coworker) may be crazy, but I'm not.  Let me take you out.  I decline.I start wondering, did her friends make that stuff up about her?  Would girlfriends sabotage each other that badly for a shot at a guy?  I end up texting her a little to maybe give her a second chance.  She basically ignores me.  We talk a little at work but I figure that's it.Fast forward 6 months to about two weeks ago.  She stops me at work and tells me she moved and is a lot closer to me now so I should stop by and check out her new place.  I text her a few days later and I head over to check out her place.  When I'm on my way she texts me, "you're staying over, right?".  Obviously not and she seems REALLY disappointed.  Maybe I missed that sign but I didn't think that was implied.  Anyway, when I get there she is all over me which actually made me a little uncomfortable.  After about an hour she gives me the "I'm going to bed" with the *hint*hint* that I should go with her.  I don't and get out of there.  Since then she has asked me every single night to go over and spend the night with her.  I haven't but she is persistent.  Then last night she sent me this really long, five part, text message telling me that she can't help but stare at me all day at work and that she dreams of falling asleep in my arms.  At this point I've already decided that I will not pursue anything with her or take her up on her offer but I'd live to know for future reference what you think about the whole situation.  Do you think she is nuts?  Do you think it would be a bad idea to get involved with a girl like this?

i97mj	-58064	1309045688	AskReddit	Car insurance and the law question	I thought I had AAA.  I had their insurance and I called 2 and a half months ago to renew it over the phone.  I made a few changes and the guy said I was good to go.  Well my AAA roadside assistance expired about 2 months ago but I renewed it on my next paycheck, so I didn't have roadside assistance for maybe 5 days.  Well it turns out if your AAA roadside assistance expires they cancel all of your insurance and other service you have with them.   I didn't get a call or anything.  A couple weeks ago my insurance didn't renew or start up with them again even though I had my AAA roadside assistance.  Well I just got pulled over and got a fix-it ticket for a broken tail light.  I couldn't find the new insurance card and he sited me for not not caring proof of insurance (an infraction).  I called and got it squared away but I didn't technically have insurance when he sited me.  What kind of trouble or fine am I looking at?  Did I get lucky that he assumed I had insurance and only sited me for an infraction for that?  I *live* in California.

2dk6xz	-58064	1408039690	legaladvice	[Los Angeles] Owner is harassing me and my room mate; entering the house as he pleases, staying the night, and doing serious repairs without notice. Slightly complicated situation.	Situation that makes this atypical of standard tenant law - The two of us live in a three bedroom house but originally rented our rooms individually and not the house as a whole.  We used to live with the owners daughter and they didn't find another tenant when she moved away.  It's been just the two of us for over a year.  The landlord things that, since we rented the rooms individually, that landlord-tenant law doesn't apply to him or our situation. About a month and a half ago the owner started showing up at at almost any time of the day or night and waking us up.  He's been there earlier than 6 am and now just randomly sleeps in the extra room.  He hasn't given us notice for anything.  My room mate and I are working professionals so we don't like being woken up 2 hours early, 2 to 3 times per week. He came and painted the house, didn't tell us to move our cars, and ended up getting paint all over my room mates truck.  His response was, "it was in my way so too bad". My room mate his a lot of expensive tools in the garage that the landlord uses at his convenience without asking. He enters the unit, uses our stuff, tracks dirt and those prickly spurs that get stuck in your socks everywhere.  He regularly enters my room mates bedroom and uses it as a shortcut to the garage.  I came home one day and he was just standing around in his underwear.  And on top of that, over 3 months ago I let him know the water had debris coming out of it.  Like literal chunks of who knows what.  The water is so bad that I cant boil pasta or use the water for any type of consumption.  He currently has no plans to fix it.We've tried talking to him about it. His daughter has. His wife has. We've even shown him the tenant law. He thinks everyone is out to get him and has told us that, since we each only rented a room, that none of the law applies to him and our situation. There are so many examples in such a short amount of time.  It's become really stressful because I don't know what he'll have destroyed when I get home from work. Before everyone says, "just move out".  We are going to, but we've both been on vacations at opposite times so we haven't had a chance to yet.  But until then, we feel like we shouldn't have to live in a very stressful environment where we fear he will break or destroy our property while he intrudes into our lives.

There were a few protestors that chose the strategy of following people around the beach and screaming into their ear from about 6 inches away.  It never happened to me, but I always wondered the legality of the whole situation; how could someone get them to stop and what would happen if someone just punched them in the face or something like that.
2fhy9b	-58064	1409870327	evolution	Would it be possible or has it been done for humans to teach or breed mutualism between two species and have that mutualism then carried out in the wild, ideally beyond several generations?	After seeing a bear cub and wolf cub playing, I wondered if mutualism hunting (or any type of mutualism) has ever been taught by humans that's then been carried over into the wild to the benefit of the two species.  I would think there should be examples where, if two species worked together in a specific way, they would both benefit but it just hasn't evolved naturally yet.

She is from a small town in PA and someone else roughly the same age happened to have the exact same name as her.  The arrest was for the other person but the courts entered it incorrectly under her social security number. She has a letter from the arresting officer and precinct stating it wasn't her and a letter from the courts saying it was entered under her social security number by mistake but a new background check showed that it's still there.  Even though she has proof it wasn't her, it's a hassle and stressful to deal with every time it comes up so any help on how to get it removed would be really, really appreciated.

2lvyns	-58064	1415648177	dating_advice	32 Male recently out of a long relationship with a history of long relationships (lack significant dating experience) in need of some advice.	I'm slowly getting the hang of things but want reddit's opinion on a few things to hopefully lessen the learning curve.  Here is a short summary - I think I may be a little too forward at times.  I don't think it scares away women but I think it may be hurting my chances a bit.   Luckily, most consider me to be attractive, so meeting women and keeping them around isn't a problem.  The problem is is that it usually turns into just casual sex, which is not really what I'm looking for.  Here are some of the things I do that I'd like some feedback on.  On Tinder or whatever, I usually keep it to a short chat and try and meet up for a date or whatever.  If I have a good time, I tell them at the end and say we should do it again. I usually kiss the girl and haven't had any weird reactions or rejections because of it yet.  I sometimes send them a text later just basically saying the same thing that they were awesome, I had a good time and want to see them again. I think that up until that point is fine (could be wrong) but it's after that where I start getting inconstant results. How long after that first date should I try and set up a second? Should I avoid trying to set up a second date too soon after the first?Is texting them the next day too much or acceptable?  I'm the kind of guy that gives a lot of compliments. How do women take compliments from a guy they don't know well?  Is there a time-frame that I should wait or ease into saying things like, "You look really beautiful today" and stuff like that?What's the usual time-frame to progress from first date to getting a little more serious? I realize that it's highly likely that any girl I go on a date with is likely at least sort-of dating other people.  Would after 4-5 dates and 2-3 weeks be too soon to say something like, "hey, you're an amazing girl. I'm starting to really dig you".Thanks for the help!

306f5a	-58064	1427232055	dating	(33 M) I feel like the girl I'm dating (28 F) is only interested in sex despite her claims otherwise. I'm in a weird situation and would like your feedback.	Sorry if this is long but I'd really like some feedback :)Backstory - I met her back in October at an Oktoberfest celebration. I have a rule about not sleeping with women on the first day I meet them but she....strongly pushed the issue and I'm a guy so I gave in. For the next few months she had to sporadically leave the state so we hooked up randomly every few weeks. Around the beginning of February things settled down and we started seeing each other more regularly but it was pretty obviously a booty call routine.  She'd want to hang out once or twice a week in the middle of the week. I'd suggest going out and doing something and all she wanted to do was "stay in" - which means pretend to watch a movie and bang.  She'd never want to hang out on the weekends and wanted to keep everything between just us (her room mate knows my ex so it's kind of understandable but my ex is engaged and living with her fiance).  Nobody, even mutual friends, know that we have been seeing each other. She's a hot girl so I'm pretty OK with a hot girl wanting to hook up regularly, but the problem came when she started trying to lock up the booty call way in advance.  As in she'd come over on a Wednesday and before she leaves make plans with me for the following Wednesday.  I try to explain that I'm cool with what's going on but I'm not going to set plans in advance for a boot call because, ultimately, I'm looking for more so just text/call me the day of and we'll figure it out from there.  Well she didn't like that very much. She ended up crying pretty hard for several hours and said that she's embarrassed that she gave me that impression because she's looking for something more as well. For a few weeks things seem to be going pretty good and we actually go out a few times on the weekend but she is still pretty obviously trying to keep both of our lives as separate as possible.  I've invited her to a few parties and social gatherings with my friends and she's declined every one and has yet to invite me to anything going on in her life.  It's now getting back to the point where she's really only trying to make plans with me to hook up in the middle of the week.  Again, she's pretty hot so I'm ok with this just being a booty call but I don't want to feel guilty or hide that I'm going to go on dates with other people and I don't want her to be hurt like the last time I tried to clarify our situation. I'm at the point in my life where I've dated enough women so I'm over playing the field and don't want to waste my time locked up in situations that aren't going anywhere.  She says one thing (she's looking for more than sex) but her actions say otherwise.

What purpose(s) could such a simulation serve?	There are two that came to mind as I thought about it - 1.  "Magic" and other super-natural powers are suddenly possible if people are somehow able to bend or manipulate the reality of the simulation. 2.  In thinking of what purpose it could serve (other than for entertainment/knowledge), it could, in a very real way, explain religion and the afterlife.  I could imagine a very advanced civilization creating such a simulation to develop and cultivate unique AI with good personality qualities for machines in their world.  Be a good person and you are rewarded by having your essence put into an android in the real world upon your death in the simulation.

I would like to find a way where I could set up a macro in the workbook I send them that they would run once and it would do the following:- Create a custom button in their ribbon that will show up when they open open the computer generated reports and link to the macro in the macro workbook.- Mark the macro workbook as "hidden" As of right now, I have to go to each employees computer individually to set up the custom buttons in their ribbon and this would save me a ton of time. 
3ab8t8	-58064	1434651455	excel	Problem with using VBA to link a pivot table filter to a cell value and refresh when the cell changes. After a couple of changes it starts displaying incorrect data!	I have a pivot table that lists the hospitals in a given zip code (ZIP Code is the filter).  I have a vba code that lets me enter a zip code in a cell and it auto updates the filter in the pivot table.  I noticed that if I delete the zip code or enter one that returns zero results then enter a new zip code that whenever I enter the original zip code again it will always display the hospitals for the second zip code I entered.  Example- I enter "90004" and it displays "Temple Community Hospital"- I enter "90404" and it displays "Providence Saint John's" and "UCLA Medical Center"The problem - If I enter "90004" then delete the zip code then enter "90404" if I enter "90004" again it will display the results as if I had entered "90404".  I checked the table that the pivot table is pulling data from and it's still correct.  Even if I go directly to the pivot table filter and change it to "90004" it will still display the results for "90404" instead.  Here is my code for the refresh table on cell change and linking to cell-Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)    Dim KeyCells As Range    Set KeyCells = Range("E12")        If Not Application.Intersect(KeyCells, Range(Target.Address)) _           Is Nothing Then        Dim pt As PivotTable        Set pt = ActiveSheet.PivotTables("HospitalList")        Worksheets("Calculator").PivotTables("HospitalList").PivotFields("ZIP Code").CurrentPage = Worksheets("Calculator").Range("E12").Value        pt.RefreshTable    End IfEnd Sub
3aq3lm	-58064	1434989998	dating	Do women actually get away with this? [rant]	Went on a date with a girl two weeks ago and it went really well.  She was super into me and basically wanted to hang out every night and we texted all day every day.  Well this last weekend she no-call, no-showed me on both Friday and Saturday after she had gone out of her way to make plans.  Sunday comes around and she pretends like nothing happened. Like she didn't just make plans with me two days in a row then just completely blow them off.  She acted legitimately shocked when I told her "sorry, it's not going to work out between us".  At least in Los Angeles, this seems to be "normal" and the only thing I can think of is that guys here let women get away with shit like this.

3bjdw8	-58064	1435602749	dating	Women with rape fetish? Obviously pretty hesitant to proceed....	I've known this girl for awhile and nothing has really happened between us. Mostly because when I first met her and tried to make something happen she was....indifferent.  She didn't stop me but didn't really move or say anything.  It was weird and I took it as she wasn't into it but didn't want to say no and make things weird or something.  Fast forward nearly a year of us just being friends. A week ago, we get drunk at some bars by her place and we end up crashing there.  She seems to make a point to get nearly naked in front of me (bra and really, really small panties).  Due to our past I don't try anything but the next day I make the comment she has a surprisingly sexy ass and she responds with, "Why didn't you grab it?"  I reply, "Because we've only been friends and I didn't want to cross that line if you aren't comfortable with it." To which she replies, "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take."So this last weekend she wants to come over, watch a movie, and  have some drinks.  She cant drive home so she strips down to her undies and wants to crashes at my place.  I remember her words from last week so I basically try and make it happen....and just like the first time nearly a year ago she just lays there not saying no but not really moving.  She's definitely away and not anywhere close to being black-out drunk.  She subtly moves to avoid my advances and it progresses to the point where I really feel like I'm about to rape her but, again, she hasn't said "no" or actually resisted in any way. It feels too awkward so I don't go through with it and just go to sleep.Well the last few days she's been texting me and saying how much fun she's had and she wants to come over and watch a movie and drink again. So what the fuck is up with this girl? Does she want me to just fuck her in a rape/dominant way? Should I just go for it until she actually says "no" and/or tries to actually resist?

3gszad	-58064	1439435187	dating	So I'm at a BBQ were a Tinder girl doubled up on dates. What are you up to?	I got here first and had a few drinks before guy two got here so I'm waiting to sober up before I drive home.Update:I'm at work so I'll have to make this pretty quick.Backstory: I've banged this chick several times over the last week and she told me directly that she's really into me. This wasn't even a first date or something risky like that (so I thought).What happened: Guy two gets there and is visibly shocked another guy is there. He immediately proceeds to try and "claim his territory" by trying to slap her ass, get close to her, and make comments. Apparently, they are going on a road trip together to meet her parents. Weird. The girl really doesn't seem that into him and tries to give me stealth kisses and stuff when no one else is around. She is getting more and more annoyed by him until she's constantly telling him to shut up. Pretty much everyone there could tell it was getting pretty uncomfortable. Four of the girls there were from Belgium and decided to teach the girl a new phrase in French. The phrase translated roughly to "I fucked myself". After two hours, I'm good to drive so I say bye to everyone and leave. And I should note that I'm pretty outgoing so I was pretty engaged with everyone and not sulking in the corner or something anti social like that. I was also trying to be friendly with the other guy but he was trying his hardest to be a dick. Everyone noticed it and everyone was getting pretty annoyed by him. Within 20 minutes of leaving she had called me 3 times and left 8 text messages."Will you come back real quick""Please?""K well at least call me when u look at your phone""I need to talk to you""Babe""Okay""Well I tried""I just wanted you u to know I feel like I was deliberately sabotaged by my friend [guy two] tonight. I think you are amazing, and my friend, who is just a friend, felt threatened, which he has no right to feel that way. But if I were you I would have left too. I'm here to tell you that he and I have never had anything ever, but the way he behaved tonight seemed otherwise- leading me to believe he was trying to mark his territory he has no business marking. I could, and perhaps should have reacted differently...but it was all so awkward! I didn't know what else to do but laugh it off, even though it wasn't funny."And she's already texted my twice this morning and sent me a picture. Fucking Tinder girls.Update 2I texted her "Don't even worry about it.  He was trying his hardest to make things awkward but you can only control your own actions"Her: "we were all just talking about how vulgar and disrespectful he was.  The Belgians hated him. [Her best friend] hated him.  But they all love you! They said he is a bad bad friend who has no respect for me or anyone else and he made everyone really uncomfortable.  They all can't stop talking about it. He waited you out too :( lelft right after you did. I wanted you to stay :( I can't lose you cause of a bad seed at a bbq."

2asy4t	-58072	1405462564	AndroidWear	LG G Watch Review from Android Authority	
2au325	-58072	1405489068	AndroidWear	My Own LG G Watch Review	I'm going to star off by say this is my first written review so I'm sorry if it is bad and I'm also sorry for how long it is (I'm so Canadian). Lets start off with taking about the software and the price. Android Wear is not ready for the average user. Why you might ask? The dead giveaways are the price is too high, performance is back and forth, how hard it is to open an app without your voice, Lack of features, continuity and not a lot of Phones on Android 4.3 and above. I still can't believe that I paid a total of $300 (Canadian) for just the LG G Watch but because I really want this type of device to succeed, I cut off a few fingers and sold them just to buy this. Like seriously, I could buy another Nexus 7 or for a little more a 16GB Nexus 5 also made by LG. In the performance department, about 60% of the time I use the voice commands, it does not recognize what I'm saying. Now the fact that you need to install an app (Wear Mini Launcher) just to be able to see all you're apps right from the Watch face is just stupid. Why Google didn't bake this right into Android Wear is (say it with me) stupid. There is also a lack of features right out of the box. Luckily some apps are already fixing that, like one that lets you change the volume of your Phone when music is playing. Another missing feature is you can't view images on something you just searched. The app Tinder for wear shows images so why not Google Search? Another problem is when you set an alarm on your Watch or Phone, it only sets it on the device and not both. "Wahhhhh"??!?!?!? I thought this was Android where apps talk to one another. On a good note probably the only thing Android Wear does perfectly is tell time. When it comes to apps there are already over 100 at the time of this being written. Yes there is a Flappy Bird clone called Flospy Droid and it is quiet good. Not a lot of Watch faces at the moment but there are lots to come (Hopefully). Now for the Hardware! If I had to describe the LG G Watch in one word I would use "Nexus". The design is so Nexus that if I put Watch next to my Nexus 7 2013, they just combine! But thats not a bad thing in anyway! I like the look of the Nexus 7 and 5. The display on the Watch is perfectly fine. People seem to dislike the PPi which is understandable but to put it in simpler terms, the display is like watching  a video in 480p on YouTube on your 1080p Phone, instead of the YouTube's default 720p. The strap is nothing special, but if you build up a sweat it will keep the sweat there. Thankfully the strap is silicon so sweating and getting water on it won't damage it. The same also goes for the Watch itself. It is IP67 so it is water RESISTANT and dust proof. I'm sorry but I'm tired of people saying it is "water proof" when that couldn't be farther from the truth. Now lots of people are getting mad about the battery only lasting a day, which it does no problem for me. But theres no reason to be mad if you have the LG G Watch because it comes with this amazing cradle. All you do is lay it down in the cradle and BAM! It's charging. This method is faster then plugging in my Phone and years ahead of Samsungs method they use with their Gear Live. There is a button on the LG G Watch. It rests above the charging pins and opens settings when you press it once or turns the device on when you hold it.In conclusion Android Wear and G Watch are on their way to being a great device/operating system (hopefully). There are already more apps for Wear than there are for Google Glass, which is really sad for all Glass owners. For your average Joe this gets a 5/10 - "Maybe one day". For your super Android lover it gets a 7/10 - "Soon to be great".

I also noticed on many Canadian mobile provider websites that they have removed the Nexus 5 from their websites. The last time that happened was with the Nexus 4, before they announced the Nexus 5 a few weeks later.  I also notice all Nexus 7 Wi-Fi models are out of stock as well. It is getting around that time that Android L is going to be released and around the time the Nexus 5 Was announced (give or take a month).
2fkxen	-58072	1409948877	AndroidWear	Moto 360 in Canada?	Is anyone able to find a place to buy the 360 in Canada. When I go to the play store, I only see the Gear Live and G Watch. When on Motorola's website, it says learn more, I then click it and it brings me to a page to put your email info so you can stay up to date on info about the watch. Right about now I'm glad I got the G Watch. 
2fvea5	-58072	1410231216	AndroidWear	Moto 360 has Disappointed me	I was really looking forward to the 360 around Google I/O, but then only the Gear and G Watch got released. So I got the G Watch because I did not know what the price was going to be and didn't know if it would even be able to be purchased right at launch because of the amount of people wanting it. Two months pass and Motorola announces the 360. The only problems is both my fears came true plus 1 more. Since I live in Canada the watch is $20 extra (not including tax), it also is not available for purchase in Canada until later in the month, but because so many people in the U.S want it. Motorola will probable just reduce the amount of 360's available in Canada. Now lets talk about hardware. The screen resolution is very low. If you compare the 360's 205 ppi to the G Watch which is about 240 ppi and the Gear Live is 277 ppi. None of these are to good but I still think the G Watch looks fine, so the Gear live would be even better, but 205 ppi?!?!?!? How do you expect to have nice looking dials on a watch when the screen is so low resolution.I don't know much about the processor but I'm worried it will make apps a little harder to develop because they need to optimize for 2 different processes. I have no clue if that's true because I've never developed an app in my life.Battery life should be fine because of how low the display resolution is.Everything else about the hardware seems good!There is nothing to be said about the software that hasn't already been said because software is the same as all the other Android Wear Watch's.

2jqi7d	-58072	1413762244	Android	Google does updates the best!	Out of all the company's like Apple, HTC and etc. Google does system and app updates the best. For the past few Android software updates Google continues to improve performance on every device. Mean while iOS devices are having really hard times running ever new OS. Don't believe me? Just look at the Moto x and E (Yes I know Google does not update the Moto products but they run stock Android with a few Motorola apps), they both are running Android great for there price points. Now Google might get a lot of sh*t for how they slowly roll out OTA and app updates to their devices but it is a good thing they do or everyone could download a unstable update that Google would have to pull but by the time they did, it would be too late. Once again if you don't believe me, just look at the iOS 8.0.1 update.

2p1hs0	-58072	1418353021	AndroidWear	Android Wear needs another update	(Sorry this is really long)I have been using Android Wear 5.0.1 and Google still has not fixed a problem months after we told them. That problem of course is alarms on the watch and phone not syncing. If reminder can sync between them then why can't alarms? To Google's defense what if you don't have your watch on? So I here I am to answer that! If your watch is in it's charger then have the alarm ring on the phone and if it is not... Well You get the idea. This some what already happens when your watch is in the charger i.e it turns your ringer on if your watch is charging. Two other problems I have is I thought the new watch face API would allow us to choose what type of cards would show up. An example of this would be me settings cards not to show in dim mode but the second I turn the screen on a medium/small card pops up over the watch face. The invert watch face(which you can find on the play store) already does something like this as in it shows no card while in dim mode and a medium sized card when the screen is on. I know there is the slide the card down feature and the show no card preview option but those are not what I'm looking for. The second problem I have with the update is that it seemed to mess up Google Voice input for me. You need to be really loud for it to register if it even registers at all. Sometimes it just does not work. I am done ranting for now, let me know if you feel the same and what you would want Google to add.

It showed the downloading screen, but after a few seconds a new screen popped up saying "Something went wrong. Try again?" Long story short I tired resetting and so forth to fix the problem to no success. I called Google support and spoke with a nice lady. The only problem is that Google doesn't train their employees. I told the lady what version I was on; 5.0.1 and her response was "The latest version of Android Wear is 4.4W2." I was shocked to ear that. 5 minutes went by of me trying to explain how long Android Wear 5.0.1 has been out, so I gave up and told her to just search it on Google. Even then she did not believe me. I told her I fixed the problem (which I did. The problem was Android Wear app was unable to get past my WI-FI security, so I had to switch to my phone's data) and have a nice day then hung up. If anyone at Google ever reads this please tell your workers/supervisors how to better serve your customers. It is bad enough you barley announce your flagship devices.

I love the IDEA of Android Wear and some of the stuff my LG G Watch can do is great, but we were promised so much more. We were promised hands free replying, jelly fish warnings, song recognition, first party garage opening and the feature I really wanted the most... Public transit directions right on my watch.

After they reached their end destination they were acquaintances and promised to keep in touch with each other. But they never did since in life people often drift out of touch. 11 years later the German died. The Austrain, the nun and the attractive woman didn't attend the funeral since they hadn't talked to each other for 11 years so they had no way of knowing this.

2peqxv	-58094	1418685498	Fitness	Lurkers first post: wants to improve	Hi r/fitness. This is my first post. A little about me:Pics: http://imgur.com/a/ibxTCI used to wrestle in highschool and was around 165. I've always been active (not super active) and whenever I would go longer than 2 weeks without going to the gym, I'd force myself to go again. I used to run "a lot": approx 3-4 times per week, 4 miles avg.There's metabolic diseases in my family (DM, etc.) Which motivates me to continue working out and eating right.Currently:Wt: 193lbs consistentlyHt: 5'11''I'm working out a good 3 times per week (consistently! I wanted to put 4 times a week but I wanted to be fully truthful). I don't do a lot of cardio (maybe 10-15 min max when I work out). I use myfitness pal and its really help me to cut down on how much I eat (at one point I was around 3k calories everyday for 3 weeks!).Workout:I do the usual: leg, chest/back, shoulders/abs, bi/triThat's been my work out schedule for a year.Food:I eat cheerios every morning with almond milk (aprx 2 servings) and I have 2 more meals throughout the day with a snack in between. I stay away from the candies and "bad stuff" but once a week I let it go and I have a couple cookies or something like that.I love to work out. Its my place of meditation/reflection/etc. It has helped me battle depression, and boredom. I love the feeling of getting pumped especially on arm day. I don't like leg day but I never skip (its the truth). I haven't had a gym buddy for a while :( but whenever I need a spot I'm not afraid to ask.I'm up for advice and criticism.I'll be checking this post regularly ^_^Thanks.
2q3h6a	-58094	1419276586	Fitness	I'm recovering from a cold but still work out. Anyone else?	Don't worry, I didn't go to the gym to spread my germs ;PI was going to go at first but I thought I'd be considerate of other ppls health.My main reason of posting this was also to ask the question: do you feel better after working out if you're sick? Do you recover faster?Once I had a fever and I thought I'd increase my body temp to kill whatever virus I had. It worked for me. I didn't have any symptoms the following day. Granted it could be coincidence but it kind of makes sense.

I still care deeply for her and I wish her the best. I can't go into details but we broke up because of things that couldn't change. No one was a bad person, it just didn't turn out as expected. This was a multiple year relationship. I wrote a letter to her but I haven't sent it yet. It's been in my car for the past 2 months. It basically says "I still care for you and I always will. I hope you find someone that makes you happy." Or something to that regard.I don't want to get back together, just want to tell her that I still care for her and shit.Tl;Dr: broke up. Have letter. Don't want to get back together.

1v3lsp	-58097	1389609788	AskReddit	Why is there such a disdain towards police?	I live in Australia, and I may be a bit naive, but I really don't understand why people hate police so much. I see so much hate on my facebook, and generally on social media, there are videos and posts about how awful they are. I don't get it. The one interaction I had where I was pulled over was pleasant and I went on my way because I hadn't done anything wrong. I don't get why people rebel against something that's there to help us.  I just want to understand.  This is the main video that sparked this. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TMOiMopMCUWhenever I ask someone, they just say that people hate to be controlled, but I don't really accept that. If anyone has an anecdote or something that might put it into perspective that would be good.

2hdxr8	-58097	1411607050	Advice	Crossroads- Dissatisfied/ unmotivated! Has anyone ever left an fulfilling job without an emergency raft?	Hi r/Advice! I come to you with a not so serious issue, though it still causes me an uncomfortable level of distress. I have a 9-5 job, that I really don't like. I have hit the ceiling for where I could go to within the company and don't get any sort of mental stimulation or satisfaction from the role. I do not live paycheck to paycheck, but I worry I will become a burden on my partner if I am not employed. I do not want him to see me as lazy or unmotivated because I am, but not in this workplace.I apply for other jobs but have severe difficulty getting to interviews, as I am not granted the day off without a medical certificate, which is influencing my ability to line something up in the sideline. I have cultural issues at my work, as it is foreign owned and operated, which means there is always chatter, just in Chinese, where I am not. This makes my job very frustrating as its very hard to communicate with 80% of staff.I also am wary that its not a hugely great job market, and if I were to simply quit, there is no guarantee I would get a job quickly, but I would eventually.  I have a degree and experience, so I would be ok in the long run, but I'm at a cross roads at this point in time. I feel very much like its time to move on, but I don't know if that is my best move.   Has anyone else left a job due to dissatisfaction/ boredom with nothing lined up? Or is it just something to suck up and deal with? I am at work now, and will be able to read responses and reply.

hjc9u	-58124	1306282258	AskReddit	Dear Reddit, could this actually possible to achieve. If so, how do you suppose it could happen.	Ok here we go, I'll keep it short.There is a girl I've liked for awhile now. I have been asking her to get together for a bit and she kept going off topic. So I asked what's up and she told me that she is seeing someone. Wah, Wah and then move on. She proceeds to ask me to hangout just me and her still as "friends". Long story short, would a girl ever hangout with a guy she knows likes her, when she is seeing someone. This brings me to my point of could I get it in (not to be a douchebag, but she is like an utter babe). whenever we talk its like we are together, we always flirt around. I would like some tips on how to achieve success because obviously this guy she is seeing is not serious at all.

Just to clear that up.Anyways, why is it that nice guys finish last. Honestly, it pisses me off. People are always saying be respectful, and get treated with respect, and yet that never actually happens. I wish all the girls would give me some incite as to why this occurs. I will never ever be a douchebag, and contrary to popular belief, I do actually care about people. I want a relationship, not a one night stand like the guys you seem to be so into.The worst part about being nice to girls is the fact that they think I don't care, or I'm made of stone because I'm not an egotistical jerk.Sorry for ranting, but honestly, what makes you so turned on by jerks, and leaving all the guys who actually give a damn left out. I may be jumping to conclusions, but I would like to get some help on this.

hvuxm	-58124	1307655250	reddit.com	Females of Reddit, I would like some advice (because lets be honest, girls give good advice)	K I'll start the story off. There is this girl who I like, and we used to talk constantly over text and facebook messaging. I kept mentioning the fact that we should hang out numerous times and she always seemed weird about it, and then I asked why, and she said there is someone else. It was a real big bummer, but I've gotten over that now.So after this happened I didn't talk to her for a bit, and then talked again and it was completely normal (just to let you know I used to work and go to school with her, so we've known each other for awhile before we started messaging). We talked as if we were friends again, but I decided I should just stop, and if she wants to talk to me she can. The problem is that its been a few weeks now and she hasnt said a thing to me. We've known each other for a year, and we've gotten pretty close I would say, and I don't know why, but it's tearing me up inside. I just feel that I wasted my time caring about this person when she never gave a shit about me. It just seems like if I start talking to her she will be all into it, and it would just be a good conversation. I don't know if she does care about me, or is afraid to talk to me (or something along those lines), or all this time was for nothing and she was just being nice. I really can't stand not talking to her, even if I know it is most likely nothing will happen between us. It's just all I want is that assurance that she actually does care in the slightest bit.. Could any of you girls please help me figure out why she doesn't ever feel like talking to me, and if this keeps happening should I say something? I honestly have no idea what to do because I don't want to not do anything about it, but that seems to be the only logical thing to do.

hwrzk	-58124	1307748435	AskReddit	Dear Reddit, what is your favorite actor/actress of all time. Name your top 3 of movies they starred in (in order).	I'll go firstKevin Spacey. 1) L.A. Confidential 2) Se7en 3) The Usual Suspects
hzyj5	-58124	1308105261	reddit.com	Dear Reddit, I have the right ingredients, but I can't bake the damn cookies. Metaphorically speaking.	Those ingredients I speak about are acquired to my life. They are things that I could excel at, but seem to have trouble over and over again accomplishing. All I'm looking for is the steps to create my cookies.For instance, I have my first ingredient. Women. I am a somewhat confident man who has many female friends. If you don't catch my drift, I have many female friends because of the deadly term "friend zoned." I don't quite understand why, maybe it's because I am too nice, which goes in hand with the "nice guy's finish last" terminology. Perhaps, I am too shy letting my feelings go and end up waiting till it is too late. I don't know, but i would like some pointers.Second ingredient is my career. I am currently enrolled in a college looking for what I want to do with my life, and scared if I will end up there for eternity because I won't ever figure out my thing. And something else that goes hand in hand with with my college is my job. I am only working 10 hours a week at a crummy superstore. I have been looking for a new job, and someone recommended a job at the superstore warehouse. I have applied many times, and I want that job because its full time, and get paid 14 an hour. I would like some help on how to get a job that you are looking for, and what i should do for my college.My last ingredient is one of my favorite hobbies to do, which is too write music. I think I have a pretty good voice, but have never sang publicly, and feel my songs aren't too good. I would love to just stop my college career and pursue music, but we all know how incredibly difficult that is. Should I post some music even if I think it really isnt that good, and should I invest money into utilities to create my music.Pretty moral of my story is that I have all these problems (I know everyone has them), but I just have trouble just figuring out what to do. I would like some suggestions from anyone who is willing, and I hope I could do something back for helping a fellow redditor out when in need a little push in the right direction to making some scrumptious cookies :)
i2h3r	-58124	1308346459	reddit.com	Do you have any simple mind reading tricks, or just simple tricks that can amaze people?	I got oneYou ask a person to pick a number. Tell them to add 40 and then 20 and then 10, and tell them to minus the number you started with, and you will get 70 because you cancel out the number they chose and add up the numbers you told them to add up. It works everytime, and people are amazed by it. Do you guys have any others?

i8q7r	-58124	1308980404	AskReddit	For any Seinfeld fans, I'm literally testing out The Opposite theory of George Costanza. Do you think it could be successful?	I am a 19 year old man who sits at home on the computer, and plays video games, so my life has not been interesting in the least lately. I work about 10 hours a week. I hangout with friends 2-3 days a week and we always do the same thing over and over. So basically my life has been in a routine for awhile now.I am seriously going to try to test out this theory. This is more for facing my fears type thing. I always see people that are very attractive everywhere, and never seem to talk to them. Why not try and start conversations. I have all these people of my past that i dont talk to, why not rekindle and forget about everything. Just do what my mind has set itself to think is the wrong thing. Any suggestions on things that I could do that is so different and many people would think is not normal.
iikrw	-58124	1309998450	AskReddit	Friend zoned, or not. I literally have no idea.	K I'll make it as short as possibleMet a girl about a year back at work. I really only starting talking to her because she was very attractive, and thought nothing of it. Time went on and I began to really like her. We would talk all the time and we got really close. Well I kept asking her out (not creepy just a few times) and she would say she wants to and then never follow through with. I ask why, and she says there is someone else... friend zoned, but something happened just recently that made me think otherwise.Fast forward 2 months of not talking to her.. Btw she got a new job awhile ago, so I havent seen her in awhile. She randomly begins talking to me. Just normal conversation. Until she brought a heavyload on me when she mentioned her best friend who passed. I really didnt know what to say, but just kept saying nice things. She didnt really go into detail about it, but still its quite heavy to bring that on someone. The conversation continues, and i ask whats new these days, and she says alot, and not alot at the same time (made no sense lol) i ask what does that mean.. she says she has a lot of personal stuff happening, but didnt want to talk about it... The usual. Then we decide we are going to a bar sometime (since i just became legal) I said something along the lines of us two just getting shitfaced at a bar, and she said she was down. So am I just some friend. it seems that way because of the whole other guy thing... yet she is still single on facebook. She wants to party just me and her.. not casual drink, like shitfaced drink which leads me to believe the opposite. Just really confused whether or not im a friend or someone she is interested in. 
ipoz8	-58124	1310670734	AskReddit	In my head this seems like a really good idea. Just wondering if it really is, or is it really dumb.	Well there is a girl I like, and we have been talking about getting together because we haven't seen each other in awhile. I asked if she wanted to go to a bar and she said for sure :). Text her later on to ask what day works best for us to go.. that was 5 days ago and she hasn't answered to it. So I decided to send her message saying I have something really important to tell you because anyone would answer to that, and just call her out on not answering my message. I just thought it would be a good way to get the truth out of her because I would know she is ignoring me for that exact reason.Side Note: We have been very close for about a year, and its not like some person I just met. It's not the first time she ignored a message from me. I just don't understand when we talk its like I've never been close to anyone like with her. So is this a good idea, or do you guys have any better onesEdit: Yeah, its a bad idea
p46u6	-58124	1327987736	seduction	I'm taking a new approach on finding women. Since I'm new to this form some tips would be helpful.	I had a class with this incredibly good looking girl and I never had the balls to talk to her, well I have a class with her this semester and we have been hitting off well (in my opinion). We talk about just normal stuff with occasional flirting. I got her phone number, and we have been texting each other.A little bit of insight into this is that I'm 19 and she's 24, and I'm afraid of getting friendzoned because it is usually what happens to me because in my opinion I come off as a nice guy. So my new direction is kind of taking the "not giving a shit" approach, I've decided to not text her unless she texts me first and not be too clingy like my usual self. So far we have gone to the bar together (which didnt turn out well because I made some stupid mistakes while I was drunk), but she said i was being fine and it was all good. I also found out she goes to the same gym I do and shes been texting me to go with her and ask if im there all the time.So far I think I got some good ground work, but I would like some ideas to improve on or add to make me present myself better because shes a good 5 years older than me, so I feel the need to stand out.
qjk7g	-58124	1331002305	relationship_advice	I feel stupid asking these sorts of questions, but it's been bothering me as of late.	I'll make it short of how I met this girl. She is in my class, and we talked to each other casually. After a week or so I found that we were getting closer, so I asked her out and she agreed (in a fairly positive manner). We have been going to the gym together once in awhile and flirting has escalated. All seems to be going great, however whenever we text I almost get this vibe that she doesn't really want to talk to me.I mean this by our conversations being very short and just nothing much to it, whereas there are people I can text for days on end. It's also noteworthy to mention that she is always texting people in class and whatnot, so it doesn't seem like she just isn't to texting people, and that when we first met our texting was pretty frequent and flirty.I know I'm probably over-exaggerating this, but why is it that when we are together it's always fun and I always get good vibes and then when we text it's like the one word answers and what not.
sbqba	-58124	1334543134	seduction	Going to the bar with a bunch of girls and just me. Need some good tips from you guys.	In the next week or so I have planned to go with this girl from my class who I've become really close with (asked her out, but she said she was seeing someone but still wants to hang out). Usually this means a friendzone type thing, but I'm fairly certain that things aren't serious between them yet so yeah I'm going to try to put my charm on and whatnot. Well I have no problem with dealing with her because we are really close and get along extremely well.. It's just that we are going together with her friends, all girls, and all ridiculously attractive. So I find it a bit intimidating for it to be me and a bunch of girls because obviously they have things to talk about that are unrelated to me because of the sex difference. So just tips and pointers from the seddit world on tips to escalate with the girl I'm interested in, and how to keep conversation with a large group of girls. P.S. I'm not looking for tips as a beginner in the seddit world, just some interesting pointers.
syfst	-58124	1335724460	relationship_advice	Friend has moved away, and lost all contact. Feel extremely hurt.	Well to begin this story, I met this girl in one of my classes this semester.  She was hands down the most beautiful girl I've ever met. It was almost instantaneous how close we got because of the fact that we had the same sense of humor and were similar in so many ways. After about less than a month of meeting her I asked her out and she said that she was seeing someone. Nothing I really could have done about that, but we still, maybe even got more close after that. We pretty much went to the gym everyday together, went out to dinner here and there. I tried to believe that things were going in a relationship-esque kind of format because her boyfriend was pretty much treating her like shit. So about a few weeks ago she said shes moving out with her friends about probably an hour drive away from where I live. I was upset because I knew we would hang out a lot less but I would still be able to see her on occasion. So I was fairly happy until...When the few weeks before she was being very flaky. She would text me almost everyday to go to the gym, and she wasnt doing that and when I texted her she always make up excuses for going. Also, I wanted her to meet my friends for once, and my friend was throwing a huge party so I invited her and she agreed. I text her the address and she never answers back until the morning, and we got into fight about it. Just yesterday she made up another excuse not to go to the gym, and it was our final gym session together. I was really upset about it. She is moving out today and we texted a bit last night and I said good luck with everything and she said thank you and i said maybe i should come by and visit sometime.... no answer. She also updated twitter saying things like nice to get unhealthy people out of your life, and you always want what you cant have. Maybe related to me, maybe notFor the past 4 months or so I felt that me and this girl were great friends (I was hoping for more, but what can you do). I just feel hurt because its like all of sudden I'm nothing to her. So my question is how do I get over something like this, what should I do, and if I did anything wrong in this situation.
tm8k6	-58124	1336987363	relationship_advice	Have feelings for one of my best friend's sister. Want to act on it, but I don't want to ruin a friendship.	I'm 19 years old and have known these sisters for about a good 3 years. The one sister is one of my best friends, and the other is a really good friend as well, but there is just something about her that I'm attracted to.With sister B (the one I'm attracted to), we have been getting a lot more closer than usual, always flirting with each other, occasional massages and what not. For most of the time we have known each other I found her physically attractive, but a good friend, so never really acted on it. I have been putting my sights out on other women away from our group of friends, and things didnt work out with the other women. I would talk to both sisters about it and they would give me support and once I decided to stop talking to the girl i was interested in at the time, sister B started showing signs of attractedness (or so I believe).My biggest dilemma with going through with it is that sister A is very protective of her sister. One of my friends dated sister B for a short period of time and it caused some problems, eventually got over it, but they broke up because of sister A. Now this was more than a year ago and everyone is still good friends, but still risky to go through with.My friends have been asking me about going for sister B (which I have told nobody about), and they tell me how obvious it has been lately. They think I should go for it, but at the same time they understand the difficulty of going through with it. So I ask reddit, what should I do about the whole scenario, I feel like i shouldnt go through with it because I dont want to wreck friendships, but at the same time I don't want to throw away my chances with sister B because I really do like her, and for me to do nothing about it I would regret immensely 
ulpyt	-58124	1338878345	relationship_advice	[19/m] I hate to say this, but I think I read in to texting too much.. Let me know what you think	So I met this girl [18] at school last semester. We were both seeing people at the time and became fairly good friends. We both go our seperate ways with our relationships, and connect with each other again. We go to a movie and few dinners and stuff and we seem to connect very well.She mentioned to me that she wasn't sure if she was ready for dating after her last relationship and I told her there wasn't any pressure.So we would literally text each other everyday and constantly. She would be the one to initiate, and usually a real good sign. One day shes bored abd decides to bus all the way to my house to see me and meet my family. We hung out, played video games, and generally had a really awesome time together. I drive her home and I can tell she just has a smile on her face the whole time and i felt pretty good.However today she doesnt message me, so after awhile I decide to say hi and she answers and we talk with about an hour in between each message and I just feel as if somethings up. We had a great time and she just isnt acting normal (I know its only a text message, but going from constant messaging, to a message every hour seems a bit and then ignoring my message seems a bit fishy). So what I'm asking is if I should be worried, or am I just being plain stupid and over-reacting
v2oza	-58124	1339724088	askseddit	Me and this girl have been texting constantly and hanging out all the time, but things are a bit fishy	So this girl recently broke up with her bf and she contacted me about a birthday party she was having and we got to talking and I've invited her over numerous times, and we hang out all the time. She's met my friends and my parents, we laugh constantly when we are around each other, we cuddle (but haven't done much past that, thinking taking it a bit slow because of the recent break up). We text everyday, sometimes he texts me first and vice versa. Had her over last night and things were escalating pretty quickly and everything felt great (should have probably escalated more but oh well). So after all this things are going well. Except today when I text her just the usual hello.. About 8 hours ago and still no answer as there would be a usual 30 minute delay in answering. I can't help thinking I'm over reacting, but it just seems fishy to me. So seddit, can you maybe shed some light on this and should I say something about it because it is making me a bit nervous.

I'm getting fucking sick of you high-end-only elitist cunts As well. It fucking pisses me off when I watch a video about a mechanical mod (the rigrig, the zombi, the guns blazin to name a few), and the top 50 fucking comments are along the lines of "whoever pays $200 for a metal tube is retard." why don't you get the Fuck off our dicks? If you can't afford it, sucks to suck, get a better fucking job. If you don't want to pay that much, that's fine. Just don't be a cunt and talk shit. Now, on the other hand, I'm sick of seeing comments like "authentics vape so much better than clones ever will!" not fucking really. it really is just a piece of metal milled, most often, to the EXACT size of the authentic. Why would it taste better/blow bigger clouds? Can't we all just be thankful we stopped smoking? Fuck. TL;DR: Stop being angry, cheap fucks/elitist cunts.

This is after a 6 month tolerance break, too.I feel like the magic is gone from the MXE. The M-Hole no longer makes me feel like I'm *drifting off* into that *dark, textural void* anymore (it's not so immersive, I guess). Any tips on bringing the magic back?I've been thinking about combinations lately:3-MeO-PCP + K (Potency + the sedative and psychedelic effects of K)4-MeO-PCP + MXE/K (Advantage of extremely long duration for 4-MeO-PCP + Going further with the K or M)3-MeO-PCE I'm interested in just because I've heard interesting things about it.Maybe an ACH with a Tryptamine or LSD? Could that bring back the magic?Is anyone else in the same boat I am? I don't want to hear "Just stop doing dissociatives." I'm determined to find a solution, anything to take me back to that immersive dissociation.Notes: I've never tried K, never tried 4-MeO-PCP, never tried 3-MeO-PCE.

So if the repair shop has spent my money on parts (in the thousands), will that be subtracted off of the  what I will receive from a settlement?

Tried to make falafel for the first time today and it went terribly wrong - the recipe I used called for dried chickpeas, soaked overnight and blended until finely chopped. Mixed this with onion, garlic, some spices, bicarbonate of soda, lemon juice and parsley. It then said to form into patties and deep fry at 180-190C.  It said the patties should be loosely formed, however mine did not form at all and as soon as I tried to put it in the fryer, they completely fell apart and the oil bubbled up and almost overflowed. The only thing I can think of that I should have done would be to maybe leave the chickpeas to completely dry before blending so there isn't any excess water.

How much should I be looking to pay for one with, ideally, the partial leather Recaro seats. The other things I don't care about much. Seems like $24k is about right? Maybe I can do better with the all-cash thing? I'm in WA.[This](http://autoclassifiedsolutions.com/vehicle/11896301/for/1320/a-2013-ford-focus-st-avaible-at-brien-ford) one is particularly appealing, and I know I can get the price down a lot since they actually had a message to that effect with $2k off the bat before the site's format changed. It's obviously customed up though, and I'm not sure how much I should be trying to get off the price.What do you guys think? Thanks!

I want to put my summer tires on them, and then buy some all-season ones to put on the stock wheels.Problem is, I really have no idea where to start. All I know is it'd be nice to get something in black to match my paint job.I assume I can order them online more cheaply then purchasing them at a store - and then bring them in to a shop to get the actual work done, but I don't know if that's actually true.Any advice is appreciated! Thanks!

I was looking up how my commute was gonna be and it seems like busing is a... struggle. Looks like the options are the 5 (slow) or E Line (fast, but stops way north in Fremont at 46th, and then I'd have to walk just under a mile down to the water).Anyone else have a similar commute? Tips on speeding it up? I'll probably bike when it's nice but I am a huge pussy when it comes to biking in the rain.PS: Why in the world doesn't the E stop a the 38th triangle just before 99 becomes a bridge?

Why can't I shake this feeling even when the water is scientifically proven to be safe to swim in? Am I missing out on free, clean swimming by giving into my own thoughts that have been tattooed into my mind since childhood? Growing up I swam in Lake Erie a lot, and the thought of swimming there today doesn't make me think twice like swimming in Lake Ontario does, even though Lake Erie is basically just as polluted, if not more so.Are we all as a population crazy to not swim in Lake Ontario at accredited, clean beaches which are always under strict scrutiny? I live in the beaches and give Lake Ontario swimming consideration every now and then, but can never actually bring myself to jump in. Is there anyone out there who can give me reasons (other than water testing, awards and the cold temperature of the water) to swim or not to swim? I saw kids swimming down at Woodbine/Kew/Balmy beach yesterday, and i again thought about it, but again, chickened out.What do the lovely people of this subreddit think?

2emji3	-58185	1409060725	toronto	A fare inspector got on the streetcar I was on this morning just to warn people about the POP program rolling out on all streetcar routes. One guy completely overreacted.	So, this morning i was on a 502 westbound streetcar and a fare inspector got on. Many people who paid with cash or a token and had no plans to transfer to another route didn't have transfers, therefore didn't have the proof they paid. The inspector was not fining anyone, nor kicking them off the streetcar. When he came across someone without proof, he just warned them about the upcoming changes and told them even if they aren't transferring it is good to take a transfer anyway just for proof of payment so they don't risk being fined. Yes, this seems redundant for riders to do who aren't making transfers, but I don't feel it's too much to ask to just grab a transfer. It's certainly much preferable to get a transfer than to pay the fine.Anyway, so there was probably 50 people on the streetcar and everyone nicely and politely showed their pass/transfer and those who didn't have a transfer politely said they understood and from now on will get a transfer. Well, everyone was nice and polite, except one guy who decided he was far too important to be bothered by the fare inspector. He started yelling at him, telling him his job is worthless and he is even more worthless for taking such a job that wastes resources. He said he is not happy that part of his fare is going to this inspector's pay cheques and he is garbage for fining people. He said he has been taking the TTC for 40 years and he doesn't deserve this kind of treatment, as if he was the only person asked to show his fare, and as if he was being asked to prove he didn't commit a murder or something. The inspector stayed very calm and professional and tried telling him he was just giving out warnings for when the program really starts rolling out. The inspector told this overreacting jerk (my words, not the fare inspector's) a few people didn't have proof and he wasn't fining them nor kicking them off the vehicle, he just warning them for the future. Well the guy kept freaking out and people started telling him if this bothers him so much he is free to find other methods of transportation to work, and that this inspector didn't make these rules, he is just employed to enforce them, which he wasn't even doing, he was just warning people about the POP program rolling out on all vehicles.In the end, the dick had a metropass and could have just showed it to the fare inspector, rolled his eyes about the situation he doesn't agree with, stay silent and carry on with his day. But no, he had to make a spectacle of himself and personally insult a young man just doing the job the TTC is paying him to do, and doing it both professionally and politely. I just couldn't understand what he thought he would be achieving in doing this. He was a 50-60 year old man who was yelling at a guy who looked maybe 25 who probably just got this job a few days ago and has no pull with how the TTC is managed.So, to that fare inspector, I'm sorry one guy was a dick to you. You are not worthless and you are not garbage, you are just doing the job you are employed to do so you can make a living, just as I do mine. And I commend you for being so polite and professional, because I likely would not have been able to keep it together like you did.To other riders, you may feel similar to this man, but there is no reason to act in the manner this guy acted. Fare inspectors are just doing their job, they didn't make the rules, they are just enforcing these rules. They need a job just as you and I need a job to make rent or mortgage payments, buy groceries, provide for our loved ones and so on. Don't be a dick like this guy, just show your pass/transfer and go on with your day, even if you don't agree.To that guy, if you see this, you should be completely ashamed of the childish way you reacted.TL;DR: fare inspector came on the streetcar simply warning people to get transfers in the future even if they don't need it as the proof of payment program is rolling out on all routes. One guy took exception to being asked to show his pass and even though he had a metro pass he continued to insult and berate the fare inspector, who was nothing but polite and professional in return. Don't be that guy, just show your pass/transfer and go on with your day.

Cyclists, please stop using the southbound sidewalk as your personal cycle track and find an alternate route just as all other traffic is doing.	The construction being done is for you, it is to improve the cycling infrastructure in this area and give you a safe, curbed cycle track. I walk this route every day to get to and from work and ever since they closed the northbound side of the road cyclists seem to think it's fine to zip up the sidewalk rather than finding an alternate route. If you are coming from Queens Quay, your detoured route is north up Jarvis, east on Front, then back north onto Sherbourne where the construction zone ends. Is that really so much to ask? This is the route cars are taking, and is the route you should be taking, not the sidewalk. Thank you.

They each have the echelon to signify they are starting the first game, but there isn't one beside the second game's entry.Would the teams continue following their rotation? If so, would that mean Carlos Rodon (Chicago) and Miguel González (Baltimore) would have their scheduled Friday starts pushed up to the second game of the double header on Thursday?? I tried searching around a bit, but found nothing indicating who is getting these starts.

Just thought on this idea..U shud be able to upload your own team Logo, so when someone checks ur team or w.e, they can also see the logo on the team page.U can only upload 3 logo's max in 1 months, and it refreshes every month. Everytime U wanna upload a teamlogo it has to be verified by riot employee or w.e, so someone doesnt upload inappropriate(spell) logos.??

26e3oe	-58196	1400956192	leagueoflegends	So let's talk Braum.	HeyaI'll say this first: This is not a QQ post. I personally enjoy playing Braum myself sometimes, and I merely want to hear some ideas and discussion.BraumWin Rate 55.50% http://www.lolking.net/champions/braum#statisticsAbilities Concussive Blows (Passive)Braum's basic attacks and Winter's Bite apply stacks of Concussive Blows for 5 seconds. Once the first stack has been applied, the basic attacks of any allied champion will generate Concussive Blow stacks. Upon reaching 4 stacks, the target is stunned for 1.25/1.5/1.75 seconds and takes 60 + (10 × level) magic damage. After being stunned, an enemy cannot be affected by Concussive Blows again for 8/7/6 seconds, during which time they instead take 12 + (2 × level) bonus magic damage from Braum's basic attacks and Winter's Bite.So lets talk about the stun, level 1 stun which is 1.25 seconds is way to much I believe thats more then enough to secure a kill once the target is stunned.Winter's Bite (Q)Active: Braum propels ice from his shield that travels forward in a line, dealing magic damage to the first enemy hit, applying Concussive Blows and slowing them by 70%. The slow decays over 2 seconds.Cost	55/60/65/70/75 manaCooldown	10/9/8/7/6 secondsThe slow 70% is way to much for a 10 second cooldown at level one.Janna's W level one slows 24% to 40% when its at maximum level, sure it has the passive which speeds ally but.. its not much.This was the only things I wanted to talk about regarding Braum, Also lets not forget about his early defensive stats, which is ludacris.TLDR: Braum is way to strong compared to other supports.

This is the way a lot of games go. I hate not seeing the damage.Second, would it be like blowing a hole in a Minecraft home? Would there be a large hole we could possibly pass through, into an enemy ship?Third, would we be able to ram our ships into eachother? Or maybe have boarding pod/escape pods that jam themselves into your airlock? Or hull maybe.
16qb1r	-58198	1358393908	oculus	Hand tracking, and positional tracking.	Most of us here know that the consumer version of the Rift will have many features not currently in the Dev Kit. Two features I'm hoping will turn out in this version is hand tracking and position tracking.Something I see in many videos of people demoing the Rift is that they search for their hands in the game world, by instinct. With our current level of technology, it wouldn't be too out there if we could track our hands, right? But in the end it all depends on how much it will cost. Oculus has to keep below 1000$s if they want people to buy their product.There are a few options I've thought of that could track hand movement in the game. One is using Leap Motion. Leap Motion is about 25$s, and is extremely accurate when tracking hand movement. It's kinda like a better kinect.Another could be some integration of the Razer Hydra's method of tracking. It uses electromagnetic fields to figure the controller's position, relative to the globe tracker thingamajig. A downside would be the price, since it's about 100$s.How much the integration of these technologies would bump up the cost of the Rift I don't know. But the main point is that whatever Oculus does has to work, and it has to be inexpensive.And position tracking of the player in the real world. Something I thought of is having the box leading to the Rift have either of the previous things I mentioned. The box could track the movements of the Rift relative to itself.What other things do you think could make the Rift better? What do you think would be better than what I have mentioned?

Looking for a few people on a good server to play with.  I prefer Overwatch, but am open to anything.  Im a little random on my times, because of work, but I am on often.Thanks!
1n2fp5	-58216	1380067814	dayz	Had an incident last night, that will completely change my playing style.	So, I have become addicted to Epoch in the last few weeks, but I am having trouble getting up and going while finding a good server.  I found a server a few days ago, and Im really enjoying it.Now, my playing style has always been to avoid conflict, and move away when I saw people.  But would fire when I needed to defend myself.  Rarely fired on sight.Last night, Im running from NW airfield back to Stary.  Had a decent haul that I was going to trade in, and then just log off for the night.  I had already turned in some stuff and had a few gold bars and a few 10oz's.  I see a SUV rolling near me, and give a friendly "Howdy" over side chat.  The SUV stops, and asks if I need a ride, and I hop in  (The server had been relatively friendly, usually didn't have to worry about other people too much)  The SUV takes a turn and starts heading towards NW.  I tell them Im actually headed to Stary, and asked them to stop.  They stop and let me out.  As I start running away, all three of the people in the SUV get out and unload on me.  I had no chance.I was so pissed, that I decided Im going bandit.  Im tired of being "cautiously trusting" and getting screwed most of the time.  From now on, I WILL go down fighting, whether you fire on me or not.   Just really annoyed with how the game has changed.
1pfkff	-58216	1383009634	dayz	HAHA BANNED!	So, ive been playing on an Epoch server for a little while.  Doesn't have a real title for it, but it was a nonpvp server that I started on just to get used to Epoch.  However, it was one of those servers where everyone was really cool, but the server owner was a just plain huge dick.  Would flip out if new people asked simple questions, or even if veterans of the server asked a question.  Everyone was an idiot, and we all were lucky to be in his presence.  What he didn't know, is shit was about to hit the fan for him.  Me and a friend had been holding on to satchel charges, just cause we couldn't sell them.  We figured one day, we would blow up our own stuff, and leave the server.  However, that all changed last night, when we got tired of the owner.  He had taken over Devils Castle, ad actually had an impressive base.  Lots of vehicles he had spawned in, all packed in.  Tiers of landing pads for various helicopters.  Would win a design competition if there was one.  Me and my friend gathered up everything explosive we could find, and just let loose on his base.  We weren't after the vehicles, it was the actual base itself.  We knew he had spent countless hours on perfectly laying floors and walls.  As it was happening, others flew over and started unloading also.  Long story short, Im pretty sure everyone on the server has been banned.Moral of the story:  If you are an admin or server owner, you are almost there to serve the people who play on your server.  DONT BE A DICK!Sorry for the horrible punctuation.Edit:  Anyone suggest a good group of guys on an epoch server?
1szunl	-58216	1387182313	guns	New to shooting, and have been given 2 rifles. Need help.	I was given 2 rifles by my dying father-in-law, that hadnt been fired in easily 20 years, one even longer.  For my birthday, my wife got them all cleaned up and ready to fire, but we are having trouble finding the correct ammo, and dont want to waste our time and money.  The first rifle is a type 99 that was brought home from the Korean War by my wifes grandfather.  I know for this rifle, ammo is super scarce, but was hoping someone knows a guy that has some sitting around.  The second is a Savage Arms, Stevens Model 87M.  This is the one that I really want to get going, because I know the ammo should be readily available for it, with no problem.Thanks
1t2fjt	-58216	1387255767	camping	Getting back in	So, I used to go camping with my family several times a year as I grew up.  Wasnt anything special, just us in a tent on a lake at a camp ground.  We fell out of it, and I really want to start going again, but have almost nothing.  I was given alot of my father-in-laws old camping gear, like 2 really nice mummy bags, some random backpacking stuff, climbing gear etc.  I have a nice Eddie Baure tent that I traded something to a guy at work for, but that is about it.I have decided I want to do a trip to Mammoth in N Cali.  I just moved to Cali 2 years ago, and the place looks beautiful.  What I am looking for is 2 things.  I am looking for those awesome campgrounds or areas to go, and I am looking for things I should get.  I am a very difficult person to Xmas shop for, so I have decided to make a wishlist on REI for all the stuff I need.  I am looking for the cool, fun, weird, necessary items.HAVE FUN GUYS!
1tq4oo	-58216	1388042655	bmx	Getting rolling again	First off, a little back story.I started REALLY riding about 16 years ago, in my back yard.  We had some local trails that were pretty good and were constantly building super shady box jumps in my back yard.  We also FINALLY got a park in my old home town of Indianapolis.  I rode almost everyday, and didnt want much to do with anything else.  As I got older, bills had to be paid and my girlfriend at the time demanded a lot of attention.    My bike got pushed aside a little, but was never forgotten.  I still took road trips to Chicago, Lousiville, Cincy, Florida, St. Loius, etc.  Eventually, I met the woman that would eventually end up being my wife.  Everything was great, but my bike slowly and regretfully got pushed aside over a few years, but was never forgotten.  I still took the time to pull it out, and ride around with my friends whenever possible.  About 2 years ago, I moved from Indianapolis to Southern California with my wife, and SOMEHOW left my bike in my basement.  I realized it around St. Loius, and called my mom to get it right away.  I talked to friends to try to get it shipped out, but it was just going to cost too much.2 years later, my wife has surprised me with an Eastern Shovelhead for xmas.  I took it to 4 different parks, all of which had NO BIKES signs posted right out front.  I finally found a little park down the street from my house, and met a few young kids.  They said there were a few parks and some trails around, and gave me ideas on where I could go.What I am basically looking for, is a few of the "older" guys (I turn 30 in a month) that would like to show me around to the decent places to ride.  (My wife also wants me to meet some new friends, because I dont have many here in CA)  At the least, I am just wondering where the good parks, trails, etc are around Rancho Cucamonga, CATHANKS!

However, I am not quite sure I am ready to pick where to go.  Then, I found this site http://www.fs.usda.gov/activity/inyo/recreation/camping-cabins/?recid=20228&amp;actid=29Lists a ton of good sounding campgrounds around the area I want to go, but wanted to know if anyone had been to any of them.Here is what I am ideally looking for:1.  I would like to be near a lake, with some possibilities of fishing.2. Good places to hike, explore or basically get lost for a day (I love climbing in dry creek beds with large boulders, or exploring caves)3. Ideally, I would like a small hike to the site (1-3 miles)  I want to start doing several day backpacking trips, but not quite ready for that.  (Says the wife)4. Mountain biking trails would also be awesome.5. Would like it to be a little more secluded, as opposed to a row of tents on a paved road.Give me your feedback guys!  Photos, fishing stories, blogs!  I want all the info I can look throughThanks a ton!

I am looking for all around fun, shenanigans, serious PvP, whatever happens.I tend to play in the late afternoon, into the evening in the Pacific Time Zone, but I spend alot of time online on the weekends.Please feel free to PM me, and I will get the server info to you, so we can get the fun started!

3fptxy	-58216	1438668577	Fitness	Dear Reddit, Ive made a horrible mistake	Me and my wife decided to sign up for a Spartan Sprint in the beginning of December.  I decided to ask one of my friends if he would like to come along, and maybe his wife too.  The next morning he is calling me all psyched because he and 3 friends signed up for a Spartan Beast at the end of Sept.  Basically, he got me all excited and now Im signed up also.I have run my fair share of 5k, and I am currently dieting to lose weight.  I have lost about 12lbs in the last months, and plan to be around 200 be the end of Sept.Here is my question.  I am reading tons of different things from people about what to do and what not to do.  What equipment to take and what exercises will help the most.  I am currently making sure to run atleast 3 nights per week, about 3-5miles each.  I also have a full body kettle bell routine that kicks my ass.What else should I be looking out for?  What work outs?  What equipments?The run is basically in the desert.  It will probably be around 100 when I start running.THANKS GUYS!

1933qp	-58224	1361640067	Pets	reddit, I need advice on a pet that we never really wanted but have since become emotionally attached to.	I've tried posting this a few days ago but it's as if my dog knew what was up and came to nudge my hand.There's some backstory to how we've arrived at this point but the gist of it is that, during happier times, my brother bought a female toy poodle whom we named Heidi, for his girlfriend who was living with us. They had been together for many many years so the nasty breakup was unexpected.My brother kept Heidi. He didn't trust her. Fast forward to today, I've been increasingly frustrated at the circumstances. I feel that my brother is keeping her out of guilt but doesn't seem to be showing "interest" or "enthusiasm". The burder of upkeep, has been pushed to my mother and me. We keep Heidi well fed and well groomed but we simply are not prepared to give her the time, attention and training that she **deserves**. At most, I can only take her for walks on weekends or holidays which is barely enough even for a small dog.Discussions with my brother always ends up with tempers flaring and ultimately, his decision would always be to kee Heidi. I've contemplated many times to give her up to those willing, behind his back but even I'm very hesitant. I guess I still love Heidi and she is so loving despite being neglected of attention. I get flashes of Heidi freaking out and staring back at us when she's driven off by another family and that stops me from taking the next step.Any advice will be welcome. I really don't know what to do.

1cigob	-58224	1366171716	mmo	MMO Newbie Seeks Co-Operative MMO	HiI've NEVER played an MMO. I've played my fair share of team based cooperative multiplayers which I love and prefer (Team Fortress 2, Mass Effect 3, Dead Island, Borderlands etc) over competitive types like CounterStrike. I'm guessing in an MMO context, correct me if I'm wrong, I prefer PvE over PvP?I'm getting bored with my usual line up of games and want to explore MMO's. 2 stick out now but I can't decide one over the other. The Old Republic and Guild Wars 2.I enjoy playing mostly support classes (Medics, engineers etc) and I'm hoping one of these games gets to fulfill them. From what I've researched, the Old Republic is a WOW clone but I'm drawn to the story bits. Only thing turning me off is a subscription but I don't mind paying as long as it's good.Guild Wars looks very appealing but videos looks like a clusterfuck. Not that it's a bad thing but it seems TOO BIG and not "personal" enough. See, I've played Battlefield 3 but didn't stick around long enough because chat was barely existent and voice chat limited to squads. As such, it felt like I was playing against voiceless, nameless AI.Part of why I loved TF2 and ME3 so much is the community. You meet cool people whom you play well with and then you add each other and all is well. BF3 and it's massive 32v32, it was hard to "bond" of sorts. As someone who normally prefers SP, having that community effect for MP is important.Thanks for hearing me out and thanks in advance for any feedback!

1fim5l	-58224	1370177983	totalwar	Is anyone else better at smaller campaigns?	I wouldn't consider myself a very good player. Pretty average at best actually. I own almost all the Total War games and my grandest achievement is a short campaign victory as the Scots in Medieval 2 on H/H. I've never been able to complete a long grand campaign. At some point, when my empire gets too big or too much attention, I quit.However, my finest and most memorable Total War moments have all come from the smaller, more compact campaigns like the Viking Invasion, Kingdoms and Napoleon. Whenever I see anyone who has been able to post screenshots with more than half the map belonging to him, I am often in awe as it's something I've never been able to accomplish.Anyone else feel the same way?

1i0vqy	-58224	1373481263	pettyrevenge	Got an opinion? Enjoy your boycott	Some context. I live in Singapore and a popular style of food among the locals is something often called "Economic Rice" (there's a proper term for it in Mandarin but I have no clue what it is) where you get to pick your choice of meats or vegetables with a serving of rice. It's like a buffet style spread but the portions are handled by the staff and you pay for exactly what you take.Further context, I am Eurasian but inherited more of my father's European traits so not only do I NOT look very Asian, I am larger than the average man here. This is relevant to story.I dislike the way they prepare their vegetables (dripping with sauces which makes the texture all weird) so I often order an all meat set. The stall had recently replaced some of their staff and after a week or so, some of them had recognized me as a regular.First red flag: "Extra rice for you bro?!" a staff would comment as he grins widely while scooping up more rice. As mentioned, I am quite large and that somehow translates into me wanting extra portions despite not asking how...?Second red flag: One random day, one of the staff commented on my constant lack of vegetables before looking away to another staff and laughed about something in a dialect I did not understand. Fine. Whatever.Third red flag: I often buy for my mother as well. This time, she wanted something else so rather than my usual 2 packs, I had one. Staff commented rather loudly: "Wow! Only 1 packet today! So little!""Have you been assuming I've been eating 2 packets for myself all this while"No response other than a stifled laugh and a shit eating grin. No problem. Enjoy my self imposed ban. I'll eat from the competitor right next to you.
1jcv2u	-58224	1375201992	offmychest	She has burdened me with emotions I could do without but I cannot let her go. The story of how a poodle made me care.	There was a little brown toy poodle. She grew up in a puppy farm. When she was barely one, she was adopted by Jay (my brother) and Cee (his ex girlfriend). Jay was earning alot of money at the time and Cee, who he had been with almost seven years, wanted a pet for her birthday. Naturally, Jay accepted. He had given much to her. We decided on the name of "Heidi" after much deliberation.I was excited yet doubtful as my mother never really liked animals but surprises were abound when even she could not resist Heidi's puppy charms. All was well. Cee had devoted much of her time to paper train Heidi and other important tricks like recognizing her name and responding to basic commands.However, storms started to brew. I began to notice an increasing lack of attention being given to Heidi. I did what I could to walk her and spoil her with snacks but a slow but noticeable rift was beginning to form between Jay and Cee and like a sudden gust of the wind sweeping a house of cards, the seven year relationship ended.He held onto Heidi as he did not trust Cee to care for her. He was broken. He became distant and cried often. It's never quite the same again when you've had your heart set on a single woman for seven years. Heidi, became the unfortunate bystander. Like a child caught between her parents who had split and neither had the emotional strength to carry her. One day, Jay left for overseas. To temporarily get away from it all. He dropped all he knew in this country and left to find himself again.Now, the little toy poodle is with me. This little fuzzball who ocassionally poops and pees wherever she wants. The teddy bear lookalike who would jump onto my bed and slobber all over my face whenever I would sleep in and beg me to take her out for a walk.The money sink. A cute little money sink.I'm a carefree soul. The only thing I was looking forward to was rising through the ranks at work and basically, taking care of me, myself and I. I loved my freedom. I loved doing whatever I wanted, spending my hard earned money and whatever I felt like buying. Eating what I felt like eating.I hated my brother Jay for leaving her with me. As much as I would like to consider myself a hardass, my heart sinks whenever I see her sad little eyes staring back at me while taking glances at the leash. How soft I become whenever she uses her nose to nudge at hands so I can show her some attention.You little ball of fluff. How dare you interrupt my ideal bachelor lifestyle. In addition to eating my time and money, you have made me cry whenever I see animal abuse videos. You have made me feel terrible whenever I see pet shelters seeking donations but I do not have the funds to donate what they seek. You have made given me a plethora of emotions I never had before you walked into my life. Now I have to deal with guilt, obligation and wanting to devote more time and affections towards you.But I think it's going to be ok Heidi. I've resisted attempts to get you to be moved to a different home even when I was the one who suggested it. I've kicked a big fuss whenever someone forgets to fill your food and water bowls. I've joined the pet store members club so I could get you all your favorite toys and snacks regularly. I give up any and all of mmy spare time for you so I could take you out to frolic around the block.I'm not sure what you call this. Empathy? Guilt? Obligation? Maybe even love?No matter what it's called, I've made up my mind. You will stay with me. Maybe even experience mid life crisis with me. I may not be the best of people to care for you but if you're willing to let me show that I care, you're free to stay for the ride.It's going to be ok.http://i.imgur.com/9kq8cs5.jpg?1

I'm only left with the Star Wars Original Anthology Soundtrack Collection bought around 1998. I don't want to sell it nor do I want to throw it away. The box is a little beat up around the edges and Disc 4's cover has a crack but everything else is fine.If anyone is interested, drop me a PM and we can arrange for a handover. It's free.If anyone's wondering, I'm getting rid of any and all of anything resembling a collection because I don't really like collecting "things" anymore. It takes up space, collects dust and makes it a chore to clean around. I'm trying to keep my house as minimal as possible.
1qkzek	-58224	1384393638	self	From daily gamer to selling almost everything I own... what changed?	I used to play alot of video games. Like alot. Everyday. For hours. I have a 5 year old Steam account with well over a thousand dollar value. Bought a 360 and all the Kinect games I could afford spent near a grand on a PS3, the games and some new hardware like a bigger TV to go along with it. Both consoles I only bought a few months ago.Today I'm selling it all. For the past 1-2 months the interest waned. I bought new games at full retail price only to abandon it a month later and selling it off for 1/3 the price. I couldn't figure out what was wrong. I thought maybe it was simply the quality of the games. So I went out and bought even more... Same. I just couldn't hold the interest in.It's not so much about being me getting worried that gaming got me nowhere. No I'm not one of those people who like to say games achieve nothing. It's a form of entertainment. Take it for what it is. I suppose I could chalk it up to no longer feeling satisfaction from gaming.This may seem a trivial matter to most. After all, it looks like a story of a boy who grew up with games is now nearing 30 and added responsibilities has occupied most of his time. Games were a huge part of my life as it occupied most of it. I feel a little empty on the inside but gaming no longer does a good job at filling that emptiness.Did I simply get older? What am I going through?

21ca8p	-58224	1395771147	CrusaderKings	So is it possible to keep playing as a vassal?	I really liked Romance of the Three Kingdoms X as you could play almost any role from free roamer, officer, prefect, viceroy and the ruler itself. The game offers you opportunities to steal the throne but you can choose not to. I've always preferred playing the underling as opposed to the man in charge. I've done some digging and it apparently is possible to play as vassal but the threads often trail off into becoming the ruler eventually.Is playing just a vassal sustainable in CK2 or do I ultimately have to fight for the throne? Sustainability is one thing, the other is, is it or can it be fun?

28pgxx	-58224	1403334154	singapore	So apparently booking then cancelling taxi's to sneak past booking charges is a thing now?	I was in a taxi yesterday and the driver was complaining about the nerve of some people to save on the booking fare of $2. What people would do is book a taxi and just as they are about to pull up on the pick up spot, they would cancel the booking and flag the taxi.I know people would do anything to save a buck which is your business, but this is just downright dirty. When several people get affected by your need to save a few bucks, not only are you a cheapskate but a scumbag. Not only do you waste the driver's time but you take up a spot that someone else may have needed at the time. Just to save yourself 2 dollars. If you're that hard up on cash, maybe taxi's aren't a good idea just saying.

I'm reaching my 30's and feel I cannot remain too comfortable taking home what was only minimum to my standard of living.So I jumped ship and landed myself a new job however my application success (which I found out weeks after I joined) was due more to the fact that the company had recently undergone a manpower crisis and needed the numbers. I found out that a good portion of the manpower I currently work with have been around for a year or half that. I found out that people were leaving either due to drama or because the work process was ridiculous. Imagine someone from operations being forced to do administrative or accounting work and the reason given was "because those departments aren't fast enough".I was mostly looking forward to the fact that I was being moved from being the customer, to the actual industry where we serve customers. The exposure and experience I can gain here is great but I'm dragging myself to work everyday. **I don't like the work culture at all and I find the work process convulated**. It seems like everyone's constantly on hyperdrive and that the efficiency of my role is being hampered by too much "red tape" and silly reasons not related to my department at all. I can't ever dust my hands off and proclaim job well done because there's so many other things behind it that makes each and every operation feel like a constant slog.I should point out that I live and work in Singapore. Asian countries do tend to have this tendancy of overworking. Not all companies here adhere to this culture but unfortunately, I found myself in one where it's all that multiplied by a few dozen.Anyways, I'm very conflicted. On one hand, it's tough and the exposure is great all the while I'm getting a decent salary but on the other, I dread going to work everyday because I'm not getting satisfaction at all. I'm not even getting that exciting "first timer doe eyed enthusiasm" feeling.I'm thinking of submitting my 2 weeks as soon as I find another job but am I making a mistake? Am I just whining and that I should probably just man up? Are my reasons valid for leaving? Should I leave? I don't mind taking a lower salary and then work my way up in a company where the culture is more fitting... but is there even such a thing?Thank you for hearing me out.
2eiu6r	-58224	1408968251	singapore	Dear r/Singapore, work environment or pay?	Imagine you landed yourself a job, that you did not really expect to get or did not really want. During the salary negotiations, you tossed a number at them. It was higher than your usual asking price but unexpectedly... they agreed. Some time later as you begin to fully get into the swing of the job, you find that you do not really enjoy it. In fact, you dread waking up sometimes. At the end of the day you just want to rush home.There is absolutely no job satisfaction and you take no pleasure in learning new things because you don't like the place. However, the fact remains that the pay is really good and you doubt the next opportunity will pay that well. Not for a long time at least.Now another opportunity has come knocking. It's a prospective job that's more suited to your personality and lifestyle. The environment seems better and you think you could definitely fit in faster and will be more willing to make an extra effort. However, the job pays less than what you're currently earning and you know from experience you will not reach that salary amount for some time.What would you do?I'll admit to being in somewhat of a personal crisis and would greatly appreciate any kind of feedback. I've asked here instead of subs like r/careerguidance as I wanted a more local take on it given our culture.EDIT: Thank you very much for all the feedback! Much appreciated. I'm glad I'm not the only who feels this way.
2ew2jl	-58224	1409285587	swtor	1. How viable is preferred status + random cartel purchases in the long run for a semi-casual player? 2. Any full time workers who are subscribers?	**By my definition, semi-casual means I take the game somewhat seriously but don't have enough time to give it my full attention.**I actually have two questions. The first is, how many players here work full time and are subscribers? How do you personally justify time and work and the cost that you are paying on a monthly basis?Secondly, I was a sub some months ago but had to let it expire because I no longer had the time due to a full time job. I've been tinkering around with my preferred status and decided since I can only dedicate "casual" amounts of time, just let it be and bump up whatever I need with a cartel purchase here and there.Since many endgame content like operations require authorizations, I'm in no rush to power level and I'm not really into grinding for drops and loot so getting past purple restrictions also isn't a factor. I get my kicks mostly from the heavy RP emphasis from my guild.But I'm thinking, wouldn't all this just add up? During my sub days, I rarely spent anything in the cartel shops and got all I need by just grinding flashpoints and making full use of the GTN. Restrictions on what you can do and how many times you can do so makes me feel like endgame content for a non-sub is not substantial at all... which begs the question then why bother at all?Thanks for any feedback!TL;DR: Preferred + cartel shop or Subscription?

2yvowv	-58224	1426222475	swtor	So what exactly is the proper etiquette for Revanite Walker?	Yesterday just after the server patch there 2 ops groups waiting on the walker. One consisting of Republic and the other Imperial. The Imperial group was slightly larger so they tried to get a few of us to join them. At this point, I had no idea that the objective and rewards are not shared between the two factions so it all boiled down to who pulls first. Besides, some of us had no alts on the Imperial side. Eventually the Imps pulled first and we stuck around to help grind anyways. We switched over to instance 2 and pulled and the entire Imperial ops group... stood and watch. Even going so far as to taunt.It got a little hostile over the chat after we pretty much wiped. What exactly is the proper etiquette for this then? Does it all pretty much boil down to whoever manages to get the most people?

37fl2b	-58224	1432710498	AskDocs	Discolored mark on right arm	Hello. I just discovered a strange discoloration on my right arm. I'm color blind so I can't tell what color it is. [I've attached a photo](http://oi59.tinypic.com/rvbzvq.jpg) (sorry for quality! cam on phone is poop). About two weeks ago I underwent weight loss surgery (sleeve gastrectomy) so for about 5 weeks including pre and post op, I've been on a liquid diet. The only thing of note the hospital has mentioned is that my dietitians have nagged at me for not taking enough protein and I've had trouble with drinking liquids due to the surgery so based on the smell and color of my urine, I would guess I have had issues with under-drinking for the past two weeks. Would appreciate any advice on what it is! As I can't tell what color it is it's hard to do a Google-fu. Thank you!* Age: 28* Sex: Male* Height: 180cm* Weight: 190kg (Pre-op 210kg)* Race: Eurasian* Duration: Just found out today* Location: Singapore / Right arm* Medical: Went for sleeve gastrectomy on 13May15.* Medications: None
38xkl4	-58224	1433701441	loseit	If it's calories in vs out, how exactly does a preop liquid diet work? + Exercising after weight loss surgery	I underwent a sleeve gastrectomy on on the 13-May-15. About 3 weeks prior I was put under a very strict liquid diet of Optifast which amounted to about 800 calories per day. 1 week before the surgery I had lost about 8kg (17lbs). Now during this time I wasn't doing anything except feel the side effects of a liquid diet (feeling cold all the time, nausea, constipation, tiredness etc) so I was pretty sedentary.I don't believe being in front of a computer the whole day can burn more than the 800 calories I was limited to at the time.As for the second part, having this new stomach has changed quite alot but my concern is on remaining hydrated. For now I just go on walks but eventually I would have to up the ante. Having a stomach that's only 20% of it's original size is greatly affecting how much water I can drink at a time. I fear this would get in the way of the gradual build in intensity.I'm sorry if I sound totally clueless. I've been told it's important to get the heart pumping and working as you push yourself but with the limits to my intake, how would this work? Would putting myself through a longer but less intense routine even itself out?Thank you!
399gaf	-58224	1433914007	wls	Did I just experience dumping syndrome?	Yesterday for lunch (didn't take breakfast) I had a small block of tofu, several slices of steamed chicken, a hard boiled egg without yolk and a cup of milk tea. Like with all my meals I try to chew them down as much as I can. Several minutes later, I started feeling feverish. Took some pills and thought that was the end of it. Throughout the whole day my head was pounding and I constantly had diarrhea.The last thing I ate yesterday was half a wholemeal burger with half a slice of pork. I went to bed shivering and constantly had a headache. I haven't eaten anything until now (1.30pm) but I have drank water... and I'm still getting diarrhea constantly. It's like everytime I drink, I have to pass it soon after. The pounding in my head has subsided but now I'm experiencing chest pains similar to when I just awoke from my surgery.Am I just "regular" sick or is it something more related to my VSG?
3b9w2g	-58224	1435379280	totalwar	What is the age of musket warfare's equivalent of the middle ages hammer and anvil?	So when discussing Medieval or Rome, hammer and anvil is often brought up but I've been thinking, what exactly is the equivalent for the age of musket warfare? When playing Empire, Napoleon or FOTS, it seemed to be whoever has the best support such as artillery as the deciding factor. Sure the flanks do get clipped but the threat of friendly fire is more prevalent so it's more than just a simple backstab job and that's not even factoring rushing in to close the distance without getting decimated by a single volley.Is there a real world reference or do you have personal tips?

Just last week and prior, an egg plus a sausage was enough to make me very full. Today I had the same and almost an hour a half later started to feel some hunger pangs striking which I satiated with a small plain salted cracker and few sips of coffee. Now it's probably just the paranoid side of myself talking but this is normal right?Others who have had surgery, how has your appetite been since surgery? What kind of time frames are we looking at?EDIT: Guess I was all nitpicky for no reason. Ended up eating slightly less for the day instead. I think the mind games really works both ways.
3c3kij	-58224	1436013828	residentevil	What was your first RE and what was the experience like?	Let's get the nostalgia ball rolling!My first RE was the original back in 1996. I must've been like 8 or 9 at the time. Was walking through a central neighbourhood hub where it had small mom n' pop type shops. There was a couple of game shops where I saw the owner's kid running around the mansion hall. I was absolutely blown away. I had previously only dabbled with the NES and Genesis. The graphics on the PS1 knocked the wind out of me.I had one particularly very well off classmate that year who had just about every console and every game. Managed to snag myself a couple of play sessions. Always freaked out at the dog bursting through the windows and had to ask his younger brother to play that bit for me.Probably the defining moment was when I ran out of inventory space on the floor leading to Forest. Found that I could not carry the extra clip so in my infinite wisdom, shot all my bullets into blank space so I could pick up that one clip. It wasn't until 4 years later in 2000 where I finally finished both RE and RE2 on the PC using only the keyboard.Good times.

It was something I've noticed more and more for several weeks now. I have issues downing anything be it liquids or food when I am leaning back in my seat. I'm still fairly upright so it shouldn't be an issue like eating while lying down or something. The flow of the food/liquid feels like it's getting stuck somewhere down around the chest area and then it flows normally as soon as I sit back upright.Now I bring this up in connection with another issue I'm having because while this is going on, I've noticed another problem getting worst.Not even the internet nor my doctor seems to know what the problem is. I've been having a lot of prickly acidic sensations in my throat. Internet searches have come up mostly empty with only a few scant articles on it claiming that it's probably "true" hunger. When I mentioned this my doctor gave me a puzzled look and said I shouldn't be feeling hungry at all after the surgery!I was prescribed some pills to help suppress the acids. In exchange for a lesser irritating throat feeling, I had to contend with stomach discomforts. Does anyone else have this? It seems to be getting worst plus the new issues I'm having with getting my food down.I'm hearing some nasty rumors that the throat in acid feeling might lead to throat cancer due to erosion of the organs!

30cnjr	-58225	1427355832	paydaytheheist	A 'lil something about the weapon animations.	My Videogame-Fetish is Gunplay. Good sounds, good models, good animations and the overall feel is what counts for me. Payday 2 obviously delivered in the sound and feel segment, the models are good too (even if id prefer the tan parts to be black or something, some modded guns look ridicolous). But what REALLY ruins it for me are some of the animations. I'll run em down for ya.1. The Deagle. The current reload animation was added somewhere around update 15 IIRC. It's smooth, but doesnt give the gun the fell it deserves. The DesertEagle is a 1.7kg hunk of steel and he flings it around like its a BB Gun. The animation only works for the extended mag, the normal one is magically pulled into the gun. And the cocking animation... eh. The spring is really tight on that thing, it should look a little bit more painfull.2. The UAR. It can be HK-Slapped. 'Nuff said. Just add it. Even if the current animation is smooth as hell.3. The Mark 10. It's a bloody open bolt gun. Cock it first, then switch mags. I dont know many games which got it right, also: its not a pistol, the magazine release is at the bottom of the grip. So pls fix ;_;4. The Jacket's Piece. "WOOOT THEY GOT THE MARK 10 ANIMATION RIGHT!!!!" Yeah, but its not a Mac 10. Its a Cobray M11 (or something). And that thing fires from a closed bolt... You dun goofed, overkill. 5. The Bronco. Used shells dont just drop out, you have to extract them from the cylinder.6. The Judge. There isnt even a speed loader which holds the shells.7. The M308. Current animation is pretty good, but id love to see the Bolt-Catch feature on this one.8. Mark 10/CMP/Chimano Custom/Crosskill. The extended mags clip through your hand. The solved the issue with the model somewhat with the Interceptor .45/Signature .40 animations.I'd say thats it for now...Bet they wont fix it, because its personal opinion, but the animations from the new weapons are really good, so Im still hoping for "THE BIG FAT ANIMATION OVERHAUL"

I'm actually sad to read that Overkill is not planning on releasing a Payday 3 any time soon. Yeah, ok, we have Payday 2 and all it's content and DLC and 2 more Birthdays for it and all that stuff and the game itself is a load of fun. But still, there are some problems which you cant just "Patch Away". Like the shitty connections, the permanent random crashes, the bad optimization on some maps, the goofed up weapon balance, the "meh" graphics (considering the year we are in and the games that exist pre and post release), the Diesel Engine which wasnt even made for FPS games. All of those things are things you probably cant fix anymore, at least not in this game.Sure, there are arguments against a Payday 3, for example all the DLC, some players paid a fortune for it, and now they buy another game for 30$ and everything they bought before is now gone. Big companies might not give a shit about this, but Im sure that overkill does. Also, what about the 10 characters? "Well, uh, ye, y'know, The other guys suddenly left. Yes, all 6 of em. No, they had no reason, they just dissapeared. Now stop questioning it, go get the thermal drill" - Bain, Payday 3.       or what?Tl:Dr IDFK if a sequel is a good or a bad idea considering what we have now. Wanna hear your opinions.

Hypetrain was hella controversial. I don't think they are gonna try that again, give out free DLC... for cash. I don't know what else they can do. Playtime? Killed enemies? Succeded missions? Or something completely different and weird?The rewards: The stuff they gave away is not for everybody. And you can't blame them. You can not please them all. We got minor features like the day and night maps and Rats/FF Day 1 and ugly clown-masks, some gimmicks (Akimbo, Car Shop), a few weapons and some big stuff like the Hoxton Breakout with Fugitive and Hoxton himself.Me, personally, I'd love even more less grounded stuff. Akimbo shotguns popped up somewhere, a Stealth reworked just caught my eyes, one reward will possibly be an Info-Bomb with various release dates... Oh, and I'm praying for any kind of weapon balance;armor balance. And akimbo SMG's. Pretty please? Start speculating! What you think and what do you wanna see? Any idea is fair game, so don't hesitate to go nuts. Edit: Ok, I mixed up Payday 2's birthday and the franchise birthday which always spawned a big event.

But we all know that Overkill wont stop releasing new weapons, which means that we can keep speculating. So please hold your 30-points-balance-checklist-with-lots-of-good-ideas-that-will-prolly-never-happen for the next balance suggestion post. Thank you.

2bo0py	-58239	1406265136	electronic_cigarette	Problems with rebuilding coils	About a week or two ago I bought my first vape that I could rebuild. It is a stingray with a UD IGO-W atomizer and up until tonight, everything was fine with it. When I got it, my more experienced friend built the coils and added cotton for the wick, I learned a bit and started replacing the cotton daily when the flavor was getting dry. I would always dry burn the coils during this process to get rid of the black residue. Today I started noticing a funny taste in it and I decided to replace the cotton. This didn't do much to help, I also started noticing less vapor production. I looked at some videos and replaced my coils. I think they look pretty good and after trying to use it again, the vapor production still seems low and the taste almost non-existant. I'm kind of stressed out now wondering if maybe this is a sign of the atomizer being burnt. The middle post in it has turned a blackish color. Should the atomizer already be burnt out? Sorry if this is a bit of a confusing post, I just really need some help.Edit: some of the comments helped me get an idea for what was wrong. The flavor seems better after adjusting my wrap to cotton ratio a bit. Thanks for helping out a lurker!
2jwi6s	-58239	1413910104	electronic_cigarette	General help with a mechanical mod	I used to own two vaporizers, but I sold them and once again fell victim to cigarettes. I just got some money together again and decided it's time to make the switch back to vaping. I'm picking up a chi you clone today from a friend, then I am going to pick up some cotton and 28 gauge kanthol. He mentioned that I should be careful with the ohms of the wiring which was something that I never worried about with my previous mod, a stingray. Is it necessary to buy tools to check the ohms of my coils? Is there any danger in not checking these things?
2jyo7e	-58239	1413951179	electronic_cigarette	Weird issue with mod firing and efest battery	I bought a Chi You clone mod today from a friend used, put an IGO W atty on it, and an efest 18650 in it. The mod was working flawlessly, when it suddenly started producing very little vapor, and eventually none. The spring felt loose, so I extended it out a bit and placed it back in. The switch was abnormally close to the lock, and it wouldn't fire at all. I then began to wonder how it still wouldn't hit after 20 minutes of adjustment. I chalked it up as a dead battery, as I had been using it all day and I don't know the charge state it was at when I bought it. Went to put it on the charger and it would not recognize the battery. I thought that something looked off with the battery so I gave it a look when I found that the positive and negative labels were flipped from every single photo I can find of the battery. Now I just don't know what to think. Flipped the battery so the positive label matched the negative label of the charger and it now says it's being charged. I feel a little skeptical and am keeping a close eye on the charger. Does anyone know what's up with my battery and why the mod won't hit? Pics of battery http://imgur.com/38RbvsI,cSYS3WP

I have played around with the idea of ordering an ID but money is currently hindering me. I couldn't help but notice the massive amounts of posts stating that KingForger was not sending out the orders. Since I have been pondering this idea a bit, I felt like KF had already lost any chance for my business. Then I decided to check the profiles of the people posting these claims... every single one I looked at had no prior posts. If I had to guess I would say it is either someone trying to get a free ID or a competitor. Either way, the claims are false. 
3cwcwg	-58239	1436607093	wow	Looking for an active, fun realm	Hello all. I have been a VERY on and off player of WoW since 2008/2009ish. I have quit and rejoined countless times, never reaching higher than level 50-something. The reason why I feel I am unable to stick with it is because all of the realms I've played on have seemed so monotonous. No one talks or quests with each other anymore. The last time I played was in 2013 and after reminiscing with my brother about his days in Vanilla/BC, I decided I would see if there were any realms (and guilds) that still had any fun energy in them. Thank you in advance!

I was wondering how Queen Victoria came to the British throne in 1837 when she had uncles who were still alive. Unless my facts are incorrect, it is my understanding that when her predecessor, William IV, died, three of George III's sons were alive: Ernest, Augustus, and Adolphus. I always thought the crown could only pass to a next generation female if there were no males in the previous generation's sibling group. Thanks

Unfortunately, as noted by other posters, they have a good deal of stretch and tend to sag a bit once you've had them on for a couple hours. I really should have sized down. I was thinking about throwing a pair through the wash to see if they will shrink a bit. I know the tag says dry clean only, and I'm usually one to follow the tag, but I would really like them to fit better. Is this a bad idea? I don't want to damage them any other way, and I'm not even sure that ponte type material would shrink. Has anyone tried this, even inadvertently? Thanks

Although they get along fabulously, she has no romantic feelings for him. She refers to him as "good on paper," but there's no spark. In fact, she says she "recoils" when he goes to kiss her. Obviously she has to end it, but doesn't know how to couch things. What reason do you give for "I think of you like a platonic friend" without hurting his feelings too much? I know this seems very simplistic, but the fact is neither of us has had to do this, so I thought I would turn to my fellow redditors.

Basically I'm wondering if any of you have a speech ready to go to convince clients to hire you for a new practice area? I had a recent conversation with a potential client who needed a support modification. Now, I know a bit about support law but no, I haven't done it before. I am not going to lie to her obviously, but I feel so silly saying "well, no I am not sure how to do anything of this, but I know I can figure it out, so just give me your money and ummm….trust me?" In the end, she wants to retain me. Mostly because I am cutting her a deal. Both because I want to help her and because I want the experience. Nevertheless the phone conversation could have gone more smoothly when she asked me about my experience. So what should I say when this comes up in the future?

However, being gay has far more acceptance than being an atheist.  Neither is a choice, as a person can't force themselves to believe in a god any easier than they can force themselves to think the Earth is the center of the universe.  I don't believe either is an easy thing to be open about in certain areas of the country, but coming out as gay is a lot more accepted than coming out as an atheist.  I think it ultimately comes down to the fact that homosexuality doesn't inherently make the claim that a person's religion is false.

207aiu	-58256	1394596814	panthers	Why the bottom line is we don't need 89. (A devil's advocate argument for cutting Steve Smith)	I know I am likely going to get downvoted for this, but I can see how Steve Smith needs to not be a Panther next year. These past few days have made me really examine what Steve Smith brings to the table. From a pure skill position, he brings serviceable slot receiving skills. He could easily be a 2 or 3rd receiver even at his relatively advanced age. He has been told he can't play football and has always played with a chip on his shoulder. When Steve Smith is on fire, he can elevate to WR1 levels like he is 7-10 years younger, but he is only showing flashes of his glory days, and those flashes are going to get less frequent as time goes on, but still, we could keep him and he'd find a role on the team for sure, except for a few downsides.On the other hand, Steve Smith is a big personality. That same fire and intensity that lets him torch DBs on occasion also makes him a major personality on the team. When your elite WR1 is a major personality, it is great. The guy can ball and he wants everyone to know it. Unfortunately, Steve Smith's balling days are slipping away. He still has the same fiery intensity, but it is flickering out. That ego overshadows the young guns on our team, and quite possibly prevents them from stepping up and evolving as a player.I'll miss Steve Smith. It is unfortunate that his career was squandered by the loyalty of Richardson (to Hurney) and Hurney's ineptitude, but it is what it is. Steve Smith represents the old Panthers who never won a back to back season. He's left our team in good hands. A new dawn is coming, but that dawn doesn't have a place for a receiver on the wrong side 35. (when the season begins)I'm not saying he won't be with the team for sure, but I can see the argument for why.
20h6bq	-58256	1394886572	panthers	My biggest problem with the way Gettleman handled the release of Steve Smith.	Steve Smith is unquestionably one of the best players we have ever had, probably the best overall.  He stuck with the team for years when we were looking hopeless and lit a fire under our offense many times.  He affected games by taking the opponent's best DB out of the game.Gettleman saying that Steve Smith is a locker room distraction, if untrue, is a major blunder on his part.  He ended the tenure of one of the most beloved and respected players in Panthers history unceremoniously.  However, if it is completely true, it really changes the whole narrative of Steve Smith as a Panther in my eyes.  If he really was negatively affecting the growth of Cam Newton and the future of the team for his own statline, he is the second worst employee the Panthers have ever employed.  Only Hurney would have done more, intentionally, to sabotaged the organization.I don't expect people to agree with my assessment, but that's my point. Even if Steve Smith was a massive detriment to the organization, let him ride off into the sunset (to Baltimore) with his reputation intact.I don't like potentially feeling this way about Smith, and Gettleman has to shoulder the blame for that, to some extent.  He's the only player who I have a jersey for and I wish he'd have left on cleaner terms.  He deserved more respect and Gettleman dragging his reputation through the mud, deservedly or not, is uncalled for.

I think the environment is more important than individual people. (though the continued existence of humanity is, selfishly, important to me)  I think that crimes against the environment and society should be much more severely punished.People who hunt endangered trophy animals and people who do [things like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbAhfThNoco) should be eligible for extremely harsh prison sentences (25 to Life).There are also people who are in positions of power( ex. high level businessmen, politicians, and police officers) and betray the public trust.  These people ought to be stripped of their personhood.  They'd be unable to be sued or be sued, sure.  That is one drawback, however, the complete and total forfeiture of their assets to be distributed amongst those most affected would preclude the need to sue such things.  They would not have an easy life as they could be forced to do any such task that people see fit for them to perform.  Laws would not apply to them.  I'm not sure who would be responsible for the things, but I don't see that as a point of concern.**Meat of the argument if you want to skip a bit of a tangent:** The reason I see such a harsh punishment as just and fair is that these sorts of things are easily worse than the worst crimes we have now.  People who kill other people on anything but a genocidal scale harm many lives, but people who cause other species to be extinct through gross misconduct or warm the earth by being wasteful, do harm to all of us and all future generations of society.  They should be removed from it.Also, few people would be in jail overall in this scenario as I'd reduce the sentences for more minor crimes.Potential counterpoints: *That's communism!* I don't care that it is anti-capitalist.  I view it as a heavily modified form of utilitarianism/socialism (though inconsistencies with the base ideology is not worth mentioning).*People have inherent value and are way more important than the environment.* I do buy into the idea that one human has a higher base value than one non-endangered, non-human animal, but one human does not outweigh all of society and then environment.*This goes too far.* I don't believe that compromise is possible in America.  We don't prioritize the environment and society nearly enough and I'd rather be too harsh than not harsh enough and destroy one of the few (and possibly only) life-supporting planets in the universe.*This will never work!* I think it could work in my form of government, but that's another, longer CMV, I guess.  For now, let's stick to the idea that these sorts of crimes are much worse.Note: This specifically refers to the United States of America, but I could see it as acceptable elsewhere if need be.  I really only mention this to help the CMVers looking for a delta to get a frame of reference.  Not claiming America is better or worse than anywhere else on this issue._____&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

2ccwsz	-58256	1406918519	r4r	27 [M4F] Charlotte, NC/Anywhere Reddit super poster Codeshark seeks woman	Hello, ever wanted to know someone with over 80,000 comment karma in real life? Well, here's your chance.  In addition to my amazing redditing abilities, I also offer a top tier sense of humor and am very open minded to new experiences. Want to go see a play? Cool.  Want to go to the botanical gardens? Hey, alright.  Want to go for a jog down Tyvola? Count me out.  This isn't to say I don't think of things to do, I just don't limit myself to my comfort zone.I am your typical nerdy programmer as far as personality, with an interest in gaming and the NFL.  You can skim my post history for some idea of who I am.It might be a mistake leaving the qualities I am looking for so open ended, given how flooded my inbox will be, but really, I am up for just about anything from friends on up (including reddit pen pals).
2gsheh	-58256	1411069229	boardgames	[WSIG] Fantasy Adventure Style Board Game	I have Mage Knight and it is pretty fun (but I didn't like Goldyx).  I am looking for something that has a strong theme with good miniatures (preferably) and somewhat easy to teach as I don't have a massive core of board gamers to play with.I'd like a shorter playing time (most of my board game sessions are at a FLG game night).  Supporting 1-4 players would be great.  I also don't want anything that is episodic.  Something with different stories every time you play (like Betrayal) is fine but a game like Descent: Second Ed seems to have a continuing story.EDIT: Doesn't necessarily have to be fantasy style just a good theme.

2ket67	-58256	1414364583	boardgames	Why do FLGS typically charge MSRP on games?	The games are almost always much cheaper from online retailers. I certainly don't mind paying a little extra for a game from my local store (Amazon doesn't give me a spot to play my games) but 20 dollars more than online options seems absurd.  Do shop owners expect to make sales at that price? Not complaining, I am genuinely curious. 
2sveb0	-58256	1421619951	boardgames	[WSIG] Is Terra Mystica sufficiently thematic?	I am considering getting it, but I am not a huge fan of games that have almost no theme or a pasted on theme.  If I am playing as a dwarf, I want to feel like I am playing as a dwarf.Examples of Games that I own that execute this effectively:  * Robinson Crusoe/Dead of Winter/Eldritch Horror: Near perfect or perfect games, but they're all (mostly) co-op so that don't offer the competitive aspects of Terra Mystica.  * Cosmic Encounters: You feel like you are the alien you are playing as.  * Red Dragon Inn: Much lighter game, but you do definitely feel like the guy or girl you're playing as.  * Tokaido: You're a Japanese guy traveling the Eastern Sea Road.  I can't believe they were able to make this into a game so successfully, but they did it.Examples of games that fall woefully short:  * Splendor: collect poker chips. Trade poker chips for cards. Tokens might get added to your tableau depending on what cards you buy.  * Lords of Waterdeep: Place meeple, get cubes, trade cubes for cards, maybe someone plays a card that takes away your cubes or gives you cubes.If Terra Mystica isn't sufficiently thematic, what's a would you recommend?  I like games that transport me to a new place and time.

You don't necessarily have to live near me, but that would obviously be a huge plus for the hanging out portion.  We don't have to like the same things, as you can share your hobbies and I can share mine and we'll both be richer for it, hopefully.Feel free to message me or post here if you're interested.

(I want it to be capable of hitting the table) Generally, I prefer something new. Forbidden Stars would be great but it looks like that one just plays a bit too long.

3c79ax	-58256	1436109442	changemyview	CMV: "Objectivism" is the most optimal way to go through life.	I have been a liberal (using the binary American political scale for simplicity) for my entire adult life.  I have advocated for the rights of homosexuals, women, and other groups; however, I do not feel like this stance has benefited me in the slightest.  In fact, given my regional location (the South or Southeast United States) it has probably hurt me personally more than anything.I have not read Ayn Rand, nor do I ever intend to, as I consider her philosophy to be frankly immoral.  Moral people should look out for their fellow humans.However, I believe that I would be better served by pursuing my own rational self-interest rather than spending even an ounce of my resources on the betterment of others who will just attribute my good deed to their god anyway most likely.  Donating to charity might prevent a child from dying from cancer, but I am not a child and I don't have cancer, so that extra dollar from my pocket is better spent being used as tax on my latest board game purchase.  This could be extended to other people that I consider friends, but I think it is a better use of my resources for me to aid my own comfort than to save a stranger's life.  Things that will not change my view:  * "You aren't really describing objectivism! It really is a more nuanced..."   I don't care.  I am not here to argue the definition of objectivism.  * "My wife/child/other family member was saved by..."  Are you related to me?  Probably not as I have never had these sorts of problems, so I don't care.  It is good that your family member didn't die, but that has nothing to do with me.* "What if you needed help?"  I probably wouldn't get it unless I was able to provide it for myself._____&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

dfxjf	-58265	1284897420	bicycling	Bicycling + beer stops == good times.	My girlfriend challenged me to come up with a new route with a theme. Hmmm...beer can be a theme. So, we did a tour of Lancaster-based breweries. Lancaster, PA to Stoudts Black Angus, Adamstown, PA (Scarlet Lady for her; Oktoberfest for me) to Swashbucklers (closed during Ren Faire season) to Bube's Brewery, Mount Joy, PA (dinner, IPA for her; Alt and a Red Ale for me) and back to Lancaster to Lancaster Brewing Company (Oktoberfest for both of us). Not only was it a lot of fun stopping for good beer, I don't think I could've picked a better route. Lots of flat. Some rollers here and there. Just plain gorgeous the whole way. Breweries were selected from the local Tourist Bureau's list. Iron Hill Brewery was left off because its based out of West Chester, PA. And we were just there the night before. Update - to the commenters concerned about our combination of drinking and cycling: We weren't getting shit-faced at each stop. One beer and at _least_ one glass of water. One of the stops, we ate a full meal. It was a very responsible ride.

234ln7	-58289	1397597274	DotA2	What is up with the Dota 2 community of late? warning, rant.	So I have been playing pretty regularly now for about six months, and ever since the Year of the Horse event it seems like pubs have gone down hill considerably. If I get lucky someone will drop right out of the gate. I don't understand this behavior, but it's been a pretty regular thing of late. If that doesn't happen then someone will just flame ten minutes or so in. Then comes either the feed or the constant barrage of shit talk. It's killing the game for me, and as a casual player I'd really rather not do RMM. But, I'm starting to think it's the only way I'll get to play anymore and have my reports last me through the week.I just had a game with a killer line-up we had Templar Assassin, Drow, Vengeful Spirit, Witch Doctor, and I was Riki. I almost never play as him but it was single draft and everyone insisted I pick him, I thought it'd be a nice change, as I prefer Support. Anyways, neither support bought courier, so Drow immediately threatens WD with report, which is stupid, and I said so, but whatever. WD's response was just to start intentionally feeding in my lane. I never abandon, I have a 1% abandon rate in what is getting on to be 700 games now. But this was my third game in a row where I had to report someone in one day. I've played three games this week, I'm already out of reports. Is Valve fucking with me, did I wind up in LP somehow and I am not being told. WTF is up with pubs? - end of rant

Or is it simply something people tell themselves to keep on keeping on?I'm a little bit of a noob, I only have one account, I got rated pretty low in the beginning; I like to play support so my "impact" is typically pretty low. I prefer Treant, WD, SS and the like. Anyways, I'm always hovering at 1.7k, below it I wreak games, one or two above I get shitty teams with no chemistry, Captains dropping halfway in, and people flaming me, cause support turns to punching bag as soon as snafu.So is this the beginning of a trench?

So how about, if you choose capt, then post game all your teammates are given the option to rate you, they know it'll happen, you know it'll happen, and abusers eventually get a delay added to their button. I am sure that this could be abused, like most any other, but it's better than the threat/waste of a report, i think.

So I was playing on a server, and since my home is on a remote island away from the main island, I have to boat to get to the main island. Having to boat very often, gets boring easily. So earlier today while I was playing I thought that maybe we could add tidal waves, causing the player to steer their way through the waves. Also these waves will be lighter during the day and will be intensified during the night (also known as High Tide). They will also be intensified during thunderstorms and rainstorms. During the times where the waves are larger and stronger, there should be risk that you're wooden boat will break. Therefore, an addition of a stronger boat could be a possibility, such as an iron boat. There should be something to break the boat and allow you to put it in your inventory. If you have any suggestions to expand on this idea please provide whatever input you can!

19guij	-58298	1362154013	r4r	27 [m4f] CT - I have no idea what I'm looking for!	I like making things. I feel like I’ve accomplished something when I do something with my own two hands. I really enjoy taking on small do it yourself projects, and although I have a hard time not seeing the flaws in each one of them when I’m done, I still feel all the better when they’re done. Whether it’s carving a pumpkin, free hand, and without stencils. Building a charging station to go next to my bed, complete with upholstered plush bottom, or painting the little details on figures of Santa, or easter eggs. Assembling flat pack furniture, or building out a whole cabinet for my computer equipment. I enjoy getting lost in all the little details. I write software for a living, and it’s because I enjoy creating something, from the bottom up, and watching it come to life. Making some subtle aspect of my life, or someone else’s easier.I nest, I try to make my home all that it can be. It’s a slow process, finding the right furniture, finding the right blankets, finding the things that make me feel comfortable and express who I am the best. I want my home to feel lived in, because it is. I want all the bits and bobs to be stories, to have a past, and a memory to go with them. I want everything to have, or have had, a purpose, a reason to be there. I want to surround myself with the things that remind me of who I am, where I’ve been, and where I’m going. I want them to feel solid, and real, to be used and understood. I want my home to be an extension of who I am, so when I invite someone in to it, what they see, and what they feel are pieces of me.I’ve tried to learn music, at one point in my life I knew guitar much better than I do now. When I was in school, I played saxophone for a few years. I’ve forgotten how to read music, and my fingers don’t much listen to me when I try to play guitar now, but I’m trying to get back to it. It’s hard for me, because every wrong note sets off a fire storm in my mind and it’s hard to push through it to keep going, to keep learning, but I’m trying, however slowly, because I need more outlets for the things I feel. Writing helps, but lacks something, and I’m looking to paint a better picture of my mind, and I need tools better suited to the job.I enjoy video games. I don’t play them as much as I used to, but I do still play them on occasion. Some people view them as a waste, but I don’t think that’s true. I’ve found many things in video games, that I think a lot of people gloss over, or miss. The most obvious, is good story telling. So many games aren’t just about killing time, but about telling a story, much like a movie, or a book, but in a manner that let’s you jump into it, and be apart of it, as it evolves. There’s also community. People who play video games don’t always do it alone, there is a whole world of people out there playing too, and so many games aren’t just about killing time, but about spending it, with others. Whether far away people from across the internet, or someone sitting next to you playing out a cooperative story together, video games are not just a solitary activity, but a way to spend time with family, and friends.I drive too fast, and I know I shouldn’t, but I do anyway. I follow every other traffic law, stop at every stop sign, every traffic light, signal every lane change, and even stop to let people make left turns when I know it’ll be difficult for them to otherwise. I still speed though, no faster than the road is capable of supporting, no faster than my car is capable of safely going, but faster than the posted limit, because driving is an escape for me. Driving gives me something to focus on that can’t be overridden by anything that’s on my mind, but only when I’m going fast enough that driving demands my focus. Any slower and I’m distracted, distracted by my thoughts, distracted by my life, distracted by my past. I drive too fast, because when I drive too slow, I can’t focus on what I’m doing.I enjoy reading. I lost this for a great while, by which I really mean that it was taken from me. Like work, activities lose a lot of their enjoyment when they cease to be something you sought out, and become something you have no choice but to do. I’m past that point now, and trying to get back into books the way I used to be. I’ve found great attachment in The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and it reminded me of experiences past, and I’m seeking that out again. I had purchased a number of books to help me with my social anxiety, and burned through them fairly quickly, and so now I’m trying to spend that time getting back to recreational reading. I’m almost done with It’s Kind of a Funny Story, and I’m already looking for my next story. I’ve missed getting engaged with other people’s lives, hearing their stories, and if I can’t experience it in person, I might as well find that engagement in printed word.I enjoy hiking. Not the exercise part mind you, I’ve never managed to find the high that people speak of through exercise. I enjoy the time. Being out in nature, where things are quiet, but not silent. Where each noise reminds you that the world is alive, and how much depth there is to it. The sound of the trees as the wind moves past, the sound of the ocean as it crashes into the shore. The smell of the salty air as the waves crest, and fall. I like getting away from everything for a bit, and feeling the warmth of the sun. Sitting in front of a computer is so cold sometimes, and nature reminds me of the warmth the world is capable of. I enjoy camping for the same reason, getting away from everything for a while, making peace by a fire. The sounds the woods make at night as the animals come out to play. Waking up in the morning and only having to worry about making breakfast, and listening to the world as the sun comes up, and the dew dries off.I like movies and television some would consider nerdy, or dorky. I like science fiction, and horror. Zombie movies, and space cowboys. Warehouse 13, Doctor Who, Firefly, Supernatural, The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, They’re escapes for me. I take interest in the unusual, the extraordinary. Sometimes it’s nice to escape into a world that’s impossible, to get attached to characters, to people, and how they would act, or react, in such bizarre circumstance. It’s perspective, on the world, on people, it’s taking part in the woes of another world, to get away from the woes of this one. It’s a journey to another place, far away, without having to pack, without having to worry about coming back. To pick up a book, a movie, a video game, and step away from this world for a bit, to think about someone else’s problems, being able to easily put them down again and not have to worry about them, because for all intents and purposes, they’re impossible or improbable.I have a cat, and she has me. I found her in a gutter, and we’ve been together ever since. Seven years now, and she’s always by my side. Every time I wake up in the morning, and every time I go to bed at night. I come home and she’s waiting for me, and she’s there at the door every time I leave. She’s the singular unchanging thing in my life, and she’ll always be there for me, even when everyone else has come and gone. I have fish, though not by choice, they’re shiny and gold, and for whatever reason they’ve managed to survive all my ill care, and all my learning and mistakes trying to figure out what it is they need to survive. I have plants, but I’ve killed so many. Plants don’t shout when they need attention, they don’t cry when they feel pain, they just whither, quietly. I’m still learning what it is to have to look in on them, to see how they’re doing, because they can’t communicate it with me, but I’m trying, and I’m learning, what it is to look after something that can’t share with you what it feels, can’t tell you what it needs. Plants are quiet, sometimes selfish things, but they’re capable of great growth, and great beauty.I stop sometimes, walking from my car to my apartment at night when the sky is clear, and the stars are bright. I stare up at them, and seem so small. So many of them, so far away, yet so bright, so visible. Some nights they’re not so clear, and others you could cut glass with them they’re so crisp, so sharp. I wasn’t able to see the constellations as a kid, I would look up at the sea of stars and get lost in them. Now I can see them, Orion, the big dipper, they’re clearer to me now than they’ve ever been. I stop thinking for a moment and just gawk at them, stare, as they seem to stare back at me.Some days I feel like every little thing has meaning, has cause, and effect. Everything driven for some reason, nothing on accident. Some days it’s crushing, when everything is falling down around me, and it feels like the world doesn’t want me to make it through this. Every persons actions made with purpose, with drive, trying to express or explain, trying to accomplish something. Other days everything feels empty, meaningless, like everything that happens is random, or on accident, that everything’s a mistake and nothing is right, and I’m consumed by it. I struggle to find balance, to see the light, to understand whats done on purpose, what’s done with intent, and what’s merely a slight, something done without thought or understanding as to the implications, the ripples, it might cause.I’m self conscious. I live with myself every day, and I know all, or most of my flaws. They’re bright neon lights to me, and I fail to understand how others could fail to see them, or see them and not care. I can see other people that way, uncaring of their flaws, but I have yet to learn how to connect the two. I would never treat others the way I treat myself, but I have yet to learn how to treat myself well. I have a tendancy to speak to myself very negatively, to point out every mistake, and I’m incredibly intolerant of them. When I look at others, and see them fail, I only ever want to be supportive, to tell them that it’s okay, that it’s a part of the process, and that it’s what learning is about, but my inner monologue has yet to adjust to such a thought process, and instead I treat myself fairly poorly for being human.I worry a lot. Unnecessarily, and irrationally so. I worry about what other people are thinking, about whether or not I’ve locked my doors. I worry about what tomorrow will bring, and whether or not I’ll be able to deal with it. I try so hard to prepare myself for the eventualities of life, that I forget sometimes to live it. It’s hard for me to put these things down, and I’ve been trying so hard to fight them, to let myself live, but I fall down sometimes. I become sad out of nowhere and it consumes me, it colors everything I think, and everything I do. People talk of projecting, of coloring the things others say or do with your own thoughts or feelings, and I’m subject to this. Whenever someone speaks, or acts, I always assume that they think like I think, and that as a result I feel as though no one could want anything to do with me. I feel like such a bother sometimes, and always assume that people see me that way too. I’ve been told my whole life that I am, and trying to turn that around, trying to rewire the way I think, it takes time, and I have a hard time being patient and accepting of myself. I want to be better, I want to be someone that people want to include, and I have a hard time seeing myself getting there.I feel a great deal, but I’m still working on expressing it. I’ve spent so much of my life being quiet, keeping to myself, because I had spent so much time being laughed at and rejected for the things I thought, the things I felt. I’m still trying to get these things out, to share them with the people around me. I know there’s worth in it, that there’s value there, that I can’t find someone who’ll appreciate those things if I keep them locked up inside, but at the same time with expression comes risk, with expression comes judgement. I try to tell myself that the people who would look ill of me for what I feel aren’t the ones I want in my life anyway, but it’s so hard to continue sometimes when it means people leaving. I try to tell myself that their loss just makes room for someone else to step up, but I have yet to find someone willing. It’s difficult to see the value in yourself, when so few people who’ve truly known you see value in you either. I try to tell others when they’re feeling down that it’s something inherent, that it’s not something people give you, but it’s so much easier to see when it’s something shown to you, something you’re made to feel. It’s so much harder when it’s something you have to find within yourself.I value a warm bed, and someone to cuddle with. The security a heavy blanket and a soft pillow provide. The safety and solace of the person next to you, someone who’s chosen to be there, to be a part of your life, even when you’re asleep, when you’re not a person expressing something, or doing something, when you’re just there, quiet, yourself. Some people need to be active all the time, to be consumed, it’s how they find value in their life, but I find value in the quiet moments, in shared silence. It’s not awkward, when it’s shared with the right people. Sometimes just sitting next to someone on the couch, watching a movie, or staring at a fire. Something as simple as that, sometime’s that’s everything.I find joy in helping other people, in giving of myself to those around me. Sometimes that means doing something no one else will do, sometimes it means giving, be it gifts, or money. Sometimes it means lending a hand, helping someone move, or build something. I like helping people fix their problems, lending an ear, or offering advice. Sometimes outside perspective is all that’s necessary to realize what you’ve been missing. Perspective is something that’s hard to change, and sometimes it’s easier when you can go to someone who isn’t attached to a situation in order to find the understanding that you’ve been missing. We’re so often blinded by the things so close to us, that we’re incapable of stepping back to see things as they are.I crave physical intimacy. I’ve spent so much of my life without hugs, without a hand to hold. I don’t think people value these things highly enough. They’re simple actions, but they mean so much to me. It’s a connection, to someone else in this world, and when you’ve spent as much time alone in this world, those connections are rare. It’s reinforcement, that the other person is actually there, there for you, which is hard to feel when they’re far away. It’s emphasis, it’s solid, that it’s not going away. Those things don’t just suddenly up and disappear. They’re real. They make me feel seen, which is difficult when so often I feel invisible.I want to find someone to go places with, and do things with. To drive, and listen to music together, to sing together and not feel embarrassed. To revel in it. Experience is better when shared. Happiness so much more real when shared. It’s so much easier to devalue something when you’re the only one who has seen it, heard it, felt it. Memories stick so much more vividly when it’s an experience between two people, instead of just one. Pictures so much happier when looked back on when it’s a shared experience. Everyone together, smiling. Lonely memories are the ones you look back on, and think of how much better they would have been, had someone been there with you. I tire of them, and I want someone to form more new memories with, together. To be able to look at someone and say “Remember that time?”, and see the smile on their face as it all comes back to them.I’m a person, a whole. Not just for the advice I offer, for the things I give, or the things I do, but for all of me. All my learning, all my mistakes, for everything I’ve ever seen or ever done. I want to be seen, for someone to know the whole of me, and see in that someone they want in their life. I have a deep well of emotion from which to draw, and I want someone to share that with. I want to think about my future, and see someone there, to have someone do the same, and see me. I want to find balance in all of this, because I have so much to give, and no one to give it to. So much to share, and no one to share it with. I’m a whole person, I can’t be had in just bits and pieces, can’t be accepted for just the things someone likes, but I need to be accepted for all of me. For the bits I don’t even like, for the knowledge that I’m working on it, that I’m growing. For when I’m sad, and need to be comforted, but also for the comfort I can offer to someone else when they share their sadness with me.I’m whole. Cracked, and scarred, dirty, and dusty, young and inexperienced, but trying. I’m flawed, imperfect, but I have character. I’m a whole person, with thoughts, and feelings, worries, and doubts, hopes and dreams, reality and nightmares. I am whole.http://imgur.com/a/jiJor

36magf	-58298	1432126195	sysadmin	Help - Enterprise Storage - VMWare - DAS vs SAN	**Background**:I work for a growing company with growing needs. We're moving very much in the direction of visualization, while maintaining dedicated physical servers for a few high demand applications. None of us have really worked at the enterprise level, and so we're just getting our feet wet with a lot of these technologies. There's been a lot to learn, and it's been great to have the opportunity, but as it's all a little new, there are definitely some growing pains too. As it stands, we have a few Dell R720Xd rack mount servers running VMWare ESXi 5.5 w/ vCenter 5.5, populated with drives locally. We've upgraded the RAM, the drives, etc as our needs have grown, and as we migrate low demand legacy physical servers to virtual ones. The next wall that we hit was storage, as each server can only fit so much locally.**The Situation**:My boss wants to do something clever, and use that as the backbone of the infrastructure for our organization, and I'm concerned. We recently purchased 3 Dell MD1420 DAS devices, and it's his intention to connect each DAS to each physical server. He wants the storage available on each of the DAS devices to be available to every server directly, as a pool of shared storage. To simplify the test case, the concept is 1 Dell MD1420 physically connected via mini-SAS-HD to two Dell R720Xds, each with a Dell H830p to act as an HBA/RAID card to access the DAS.Of all the documentation I've ready, nothing says to do this, nothing says this should work. Everything says that for shared storage like this, we should be using another SAN type technology, like FibreChannel, or iSCSI, even NFS, and not direct attached storage over SAS.He's adamant that it will work, even though the VMWare rep said no, and the Dell rep said no.**The Question**:Does anyone have any experience with using a DAS for shared storage between two servers? Where SAS provides the bus as opposed to another technology? Is there any documentation that suggests how to build out this way, and how to troubleshoot/support the system moving forward? I've pointed to documentation that recommends alternatives, including benchmarks, installation and troubleshooting procedures, etc, but he's adamant that this is what he wants, and I'm concerned he's going to build something that "works" but that we'll be in an awful position to support it if it fails.I don't have any hands on experience with these technologies, no one in this company does, and so I definitely have some issues doing something that's non-standard/clever, which is what this seems to be? I'd appreciate if anyone with more background than I could shed some light on whether this is something that could/should work, and maybe some tips on how to better communicate to my superior that we shouldn't do this if it can't/won't work.

26n24c	-58300	1401226003	RedPillWomen	RP advice for living with alcoholism?	I've thought long and hard about the kind of advice I want and need from the RPW community. Being single, I've settled on some passive reading here and active self-improvement in life. Part of this has been taking a reflective approach to my relationships, past, present, and potential ones. Keeping in mind that I need to be the type of woman I would want to be for my future SO, I've been thinking about some of the common problems I encounter and why I have the feelings that I do. A common thread I have picked out and would like some RPW thoughts on concerns alcohol.I meet men all the time who enjoy drinking. Family, friends, and potential interests. It's not a huge influence on my life but it had come up often enough recently that I thought I should examine it. I'm not a drinker myself, but I enjoy the occasional social gathering that includes adult beverages. Personally, I frown upon frequent drinking.**What would be an appropriate RPW response to a man's drinking habits?**My stepfather drinks at least a six-pack a night. Multiple exes drank just for fun, but would frequently take it too far. Some claim that they don't need it, can quit anytime. Violence is not my concern, but I value a man who is in charge of all if his faculties when he is around me.Men, please feel free to chime in. I'd like perspectives from both sides. Thank you.Edit: Thank you for the answers--concise to thorough, honest to anecdotal. You've given me a lot to think about, including a reminder that boundaries are important and exercising them is equally important.

28ri3t	-58300	1403400952	RedPillWomen	First Date (field report)	Ladies, thank you for all of the support you give on here. I think I found a Captain. Now I hope to continue to improve. My story is as follows...I've been trying online dating for several months. After wading through the PUAs, the major Alphas, and several Betas, I received a message on Plenty of Fish, the dating site/app. He was polite and inquiring. We exchanged numbers early so we could exchange pictures.He is 31 and I am 27. He is a businessman and I am a high school teacher. He ended his last LTR because she was lazy. My last relationship ended because I could not be submissive to a low value man.We met at a restaurant in my town today for lunch. He came into town last night because he had a business meeting here. I insisted on meeting during the day.He have me two choices for restaurants because I couldn't decide. I don't like making decisions like that anyway, so it was nice that he narrowed it down. I was nervous, and so was he. He dresses in a suit 90% of the time, but expressed that he likes women in casual clothes. We were meeting at a steakhouse, so I went with nice black pants and a cream top with lace down the sides and [these shoes.](http://www.payless.com/womens-kim-button-mary-jane/73817.html?dwvar_73817_color=blacksuede) Also, no make up except lip gloss (because humid and sunglasses.)We moved the original meeting from 11 to noon at his request. Since I had the whole day off, I told him to take his time, he had business to attend to. At noon, he was 10 minutes late anyway so I waited outside the restaurant. He apologized profusely; it was the GPS messing up.First impression? Oh. My. Goodness. He pulled up in a brand new Cadillac. He drives a lot for business, so I wasn't entirely surprised, just pleasantly so. He also opens/holds doors open for women. In my heels, I'm just shorter than he is. The perfect height for dancing.We went inside and were seated immediately. The waitress was nice, because we kept talking instead of deciding what we wanted to eat. She kept taking her cues from me. (Is this normal in a restaurant? To take the cues from the girl when a couple is seated?)We talked about work, school, travel, and family. He has an accent and seemed content to hear me talk when he had questions. He noticed that I was addressing the waitress by her name, so I explained that it was just something I did because they have a hard job. He says I'm so nice to do that.We skipped dessert and went for a drive to downtown. My city doesn't have a lot to offer for entertainment, but we walked to look at the art gallery and I introduced him to our local candy shop, which has the best caramel corn. Somewhere in the novelty candy aisle he decided to take my hand and ask me if I knew how to dance. He have me a little twirl, pulled me close and kissed me. Wow. (Lots of intermittent kissing until the end of our date, I'll spare you.) We took a little walk to the fountain and sat in the park to talk a little more. Neither of us were ready to end the date so we went for a drive. I answered questions about my city. Showed him a few things of unimport.He was very straightforward about exclusivity. And asked if that was okay, if we could be exclusive immediately. I agreed. He doesn't want to waste time with noncommitment and neither do I.He's travelling Monday through Thursday next week, but will be traveling between cities tomorrow evening, so we're going to a movie together. We didn't want to separate at the conclusion of our date. He walked me over to my car and opened my door for me. (Lots of goodbye kisses.)Texts later included a lot of compliments. :)I'm leaving out minor things. If you have questions, ask away! I'm so elated I can hardly breathe.

Jokes on him, I'm the most educated female in the family and on my way to being the most educated period, my husband who I married at age 27 took MY last name (hyphenated with both of us having my last name first) and he had a vasectomy earlier this year. SUCK ON THAT ASSHOLE.&gt; Lots of TRP types. One of them raped me.Why is the world so full of hate for people who believe differently? Sure, I cringe at the thought of this woman being proud that her husband is neutered, and I cannot believe someone has the gall to suggest that an ideology condones rape. [What. The.

2abb37	-58300	1404975244	TwoXChromosomes	Why I am not a "feminist"...	[Cosmopolitan - Why Don't More People Call Themselves Feminists?](http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/news/a28510/misconceptions-about-feminism/)I admire this writer's attempt to explain the indifference towards the term "feminist." The term.As an English teacher, I have a special admiration for words. Words have two meanings: the dictionary definition, which everyone should subscribe to since it is foundational; and the connotation of the word... the symbolic, personal, and heavily criticized version.&gt;When respondents to the 2013 poll were given the dictionary definition of feminist — "someone who believes in the social, political and economic equality of the sexes" — 57 percent of respondents, including 67 percent of women and 47 percent of men, agreed that, yes, they were feminists.Feminism has a negative connotation.&gt;The problem, then, seems to be the word itself, and not what it stands for. When people learn what feminism actually means either through education or by simply hearing a definition of the term, they're more likely to adopt it. But who can blame folks for initially balking? Right-wing radio hosts have built entire careers on branding feminist-minded women "feminazis," and every inch toward equality has seen a foot of backlash, often in the form of stereotyping feminists as unattractive man-haters. American women are strongly socialized to be people-pleasers, to put work into being pretty, to be nice and likable and, especially, appealing to men. The many traditionalists who oppose feminist values, including equality in the home and at work, have been particularly savvy in exploiting that desire to be attractive and agreeable by casting feminists as the opposite.While I don't necessarily agree with the final statement (wherein the writer fails to clearly define what a "traditionalist" is,) the point being that negative connotation has overridden the positive aspects.I like my right to vote, being treated equally in the eyes of the law, and walking down the street safely just as much as the next girl. I support women's rights and men's rights, equally. I won't call myself a feminist though, because I don't know what you (the reader, the listener, the viewer) think it connotes.&gt;[Non-celebrity women and men proudly identifying as feminists and doing the hard work of promoting women's rights every day] are building a world where, someday, "Are you a feminist?" won't be a question — not because the belief that men and women should be equal will have died out, but because the ideal will have become reality.In an ideal world, we wouldn't even be having a problem, we would all just get along.Edit: typos

1q87j9	-58327	1383971638	TalesFromRetail	A Tale From A Car Dealership	I have a story from about a year ago when I worked at a local car dealership during highschool. During my 11 months working at a car dealership I met some strange, crazy, and downright rude people.  The story Im about to tell you happened on the dreaded weekly saturday 7:30 to 4:30 shift. So it was 7:30am I just clocked in hungover from the night before. The dealership had a large department for service and saturdays were always a busy day. By the time I clocked in there was already a line of four or five cars waiting to get their cars serviced. This was normal but we dont begin servicing cars until 8:00. After clocking in I begin to go about my daily routine but stop when I see a man standing at the front door of the service shop. I go to the door to open it and ask if I can help him. Once I get to the door I notice that he, flaccid dick in hand, is pissing all over the door. What.The.Fuck. The most fucked up part about this story is that the wonderful car dealership proceeds to service his car.Tldr; Man ruins highschoolers saturday morning by taking out shriveled up johnson and pissing all over a door.

I am planning on buying tickets for the Cubs game on Sunday 9/6 and suprising my family, including my dad who is a lifelong fan. Since I've never been to Wrigley, my question for you guys is where are the best seats I can get for around $250 (for 4 tickets), and what websites are cheap and reliable. I don't want to make the mistake of getting tickets that are next to a pole or too far from the action. I plan on making this a whole day affair, such as walking around the area around Chicago so if anyone knows anywhere fun to go in the surrounding area feel free to make suggestions. I am a broke college student with a $9/hr job so I'm trying not to spend more than $300 on the day total including meals and other activities. Thanks in advance. Go Cubs!
14sw5s	-58328	1355429888	AskReddit	What is the most irresponsible thing you have done on vacation that turned out to be great? 	I recently went on a trip to Mexico. One night at the resort I (27f) was drinking with my friends. They all went to bed leaving me with a very good looking Norwegian man. He left and four Canadian men came up and began talking to me. After several more drinks and shots we decide to walk to the other end of the resort to a different bar. We barhop for a couple hours then skinny dip in the ocean. I go back to my room alone, wasted and completely safe at the end of the night. We have since become great friends and are actually planning a trip to Las Vegas together next year. In America, I would have never gone off with four strange men to do anything let alone drink and skinny dip for fear of all those things our parents warn young girls against.

uiqdr	-58334	1338741571	jobs	Looking for a nonprofit accounting job	I live and work in NYC. Graduated with an accounting degree in Fall 2011 and started a full time job as a tax accountant in January 2012. I don't like the company I work for and I'm actually terrified that I'm going to get fired. The managing partner seems to fire people without a good reason. I do a great job, and I know I do because the partners say I do, but still - with the managing partner, I don't know if he'd fire me. I've been at this 10 employees company for barely 6 months and I've seen 7 people get fired and consequently 7 new people get hired. This makes me very paranoid regardless of how well I do.Here's the thing though. Throughout college with the exception of an accounting internship I held during my senior year, I interned for nonprofits. I love working in a nonprofit environment and I would like to get back to it. I would have majored in a degree directly related to nonprofits but I pretty much sold my soul to an accounting degree due to the economy.Here's my question - with 3 years of experience interning with nonprofits (development, advocacy, public policy, membership recruitment) and about 1.5 years of accounting experience (1 year of a financial accounting internship and my current job as as tax accountant), but NO nonprofit accounting experience, how easy will it be to get a nonprofit accounting job? I don't want to let my accounting degree go to waste so that's why I want to still be involved with accounting. Thanks Reddit.  I posted this in the Accounting subreddit too.

It's enough that you're taking time out of your Saturday to help out.  Locations of service projects haven't been assigned yet, but teams will know by April 8th. We have until Friday, April 12th to sign up with the team.  Ask your friends to sign up with you too, if you want.  The more the merrier, right?  Let me know if you have any questions.

3021of	-58334	1427144897	jobs	Moving from tax accounting to nonprofit work	Some background - In 2009, I graduated with a BA in psychology with a minor in human services. I interned with a few nonprofit organizations while in school, and while one of them said they would love to hire me, they didn't because they couldn't afford to hire more staff. I spent a year searching for jobs in my field but couldn't find one.Not finding a job in my major really bummed me out, so I went back to school for a more marketable major - accounting. When I started classes, I was hired as an AmeriCorps member for a small nonprofit in my hometown. It was one of the greatest things I've ever done in my life.So back to my accounting degree. I finished it while still in AmeriCorps. Found a job immediately after graduating. I've been at this company for 3 years. Now throughout this job, just to keep me involved in community service, I volunteer on weekends at soup kitchens, financial literacy centers, and animal shelters. But I want to make this thing a full-time job. I want to quit my job in accounting, and go back to nonprofit work doing community outreach, program development, maybe even nonprofit accounting? I really just want to go back to having a job that lets me spend my entire day helping people. And even if it wouldn't be direct service, I would love to work in the offices of an organization that helps people, so my work is helping people help others. Does anyone have experiences they could share about moving from finance/accounting to nonprofit work? Was it difficult to get hired? Will it be difficult to find anything since I spent the last three years not doing nonprofit work? Any advice? If it makes any difference, I live in NYC. Thanks for reading.

There's one for EVERYTHING - I don't know why I never thought there wouldn't be one about AmeriCorps. Anyway, I'm State and National alumni. I served 5 years ago. It was the most fulfilling and fun year of my life, and I met some wonderful people who are my closest friends to this day. I hope you all have an awesome time during your year of service. I'm a complete stranger, but this stranger is so happy for all of you! Yay!

3dy2ek	-58334	1437400592	AmeriCorps	I'm almost 30. Thinking about joining AmeriCorps again. Thoughts?	I'm 28 years old.  After graduating college in 2008, I served a year in State &amp; National. I didn't get a nonprofit job after AmeriCorps.  My majors in school were human services, psychology, and accounting.  My post-AmeriCorps job was an accountant even though that was the major where I had the least amount of real-world experience.  I've had this job for around 4 years.  I miss everything about working for a nonprofit and want to go back.The urge right now has never been stronger to go back into service work.   I volunteer around 4 times a month on weekends to get a "fix."  As for switching careers, I've tried applying to different nonprofits in my city but haven't gotten any requests for interviews.  This is leading me to thinking about also applying to AmeriCorps VISTA positions here in NYC.  I can afford it because I already have roommates and can cut back on expenses.  Does anyone have thoughts on doing AmeriCorps at this old of an age?  Do agencies look down on applicants who are not recent college grads?  Would my job experience as an accountant hurt my chances of getting in?  Any thoughts, otherwise?  Thank you.Edit:  Thank you SO MUCH for the words of encouragement.  I applied for 3 VISTA positions today.  I hope I get in.  I'm really excited for a career change.  It'll be so nice to go into work 100% happy with doing what I love again.

I swear I proofread all of my cover letters. At least for me, I think.  It becomes way easier to talk about that time when you worked well under pressure in the workplace, when you accumulate working years and have actual big girl/big boy work issues you can talk about.  So, reddit, how was your day?  Anyone else go on interviews?  Any embarrassing interview moments you want to talk about, for you or the interviewer?

I know this is crazy last minute and my chances are slim, but you never know until you ask! It's my 4 year anniversary with my boyfriend tomorrow. And I wanted to get a piece commissioned for him. My boyfriend and I are both fans of Batman, and our miniature pinscher mix, Marlon. The picture attached is from a few years back when his fur was all brown. He's almost 10 now and his fur's graying, but he's still as awesome as ever. Could someone please draw him? I'm linking two pictures - one of Marlon, and one of a dog in a Batman costume. Looking to keep the same style, ie replace the golden retriever in the picture with Marlon. Sorry for the low quality of the pictures. Thank you!

I've decided on not giving more than two weeks. I've told my boss that but he still insists on me working more. Also, between that post and now, my mom had heart surgery (it was yesterday). Surgery went as planned but the doctors said that these next few days are just as important as the surgery itself. My dad's upset. He wants me home and I know my mom would like to see me there too. I don't want it to look like I want my boss to cry me a river, but my parents wanting me home after a major operation is legitimately my reason for not wanting to work more than two weeks. I don't know how to say that without sounding like I want my boss to take pity on me.

1vnlqc	-58338	1390200883	changemyview	I believe that prison gang members harm rehabilitation objectives and should be dealt with differently. Please CMV	Main claim to dispute: Due to gangs' somewhat likely negative influence on the desirable rehabilitation process, gang activities should be scrutinized and disrupted. This is perhaps idealistic so let's talk about the merit of the idea rather than challenges (costs, costs, costs) to implementing this. CMVLet's say for the sake of argument that prison gangs may exist. Where a person enters the prison population and is forced to join a gang because that's how they will avoid being harmed. Sometimes prison gangs may be established based on race and/or ethnic and/or religious backgrounds (also linguistics, places of origin, level of education, etc); let this item cover every possibility as it relates to countries other than United States of America. Let's assume that the official objectives of prisons may be for some prisoners (but not all) to rehabilitate and re-enter society with a better attitude and ability to function according to typical expectations (job, a place to live, how about not being in jail). Gangs in prison may deny prisoners the opportunity to change their attitudes and instead may lead to exposure to violence and criminal activities (gambling, dealing drugs, assaults on demand) in order to gain status or be accepted by a gang. Members of gangs should be given an opportunity to learn how to function in non-prison society, hold down a job and build healthy relationships. Gang members who fail to get with the program should be treated as dangerous and have their sentences reviewed because of their willingness to engage in violent and anti-social behavior that will likely lead to recidivism or just crime.  CMVWhat I do not see as relevant to the discussion is the ex post condition: why the person went to jail (three-strikes laws, selling weed, or crimes that statistically involve vulnerable or minority populations that are over-represented in prison). Any gang activity in prison without prejudice or preference should be treated harshly by corrective authorities. Edit 1: So what do you think about gangs? do they help or hurt prisoners who want to leave prison? If you decided to complain about the system being broken and slanted, it is a valid critique but not a response to what I am asking.
1xbql7	-58338	1391826683	changemyview	I believe that the academic field of International Relations suffers when non-state actors play a bigger role in politics and international relations. CMV.	Let's assume that International Relations is an academic discipline in American Universities (at least). There are offerings on different levels (bachelor's, Masters, Doctorate, certificates). This discipline deals with various issues (war and peace, transnational issues such as crime, human rights, immigration, and other important things with varying social, economic and cultural parameters. Main claim to dispute: Recent activity (since 1990's) such as terrorism in general, the Arab Spring, revolt in Libya, Syria and others, ethnic cleansing in African countries and Yugoslavia, debt and financial crises, essentially where non-state actors or intrastate conflict is the subject matter, adversely impact the utility, prestige and relevance of International Relations as an academic discipline by demonstrating the decreased relevance of IR theories to contemporary events, decreased ability to predict and prepare for events, and decreased ability to offer insights to guide policy or find satisfactory solutions through the international system (UN, WHO, IMF, etc). CMVThe issues listed above present a challenge for the international system, regime, order, or whatever it is being called now. As far as education goes, as universities continue to offer degree programs, these challenges are not exactly being analyzed through a systematic perspective; the academics are finding it difficult to respond to these issues (as are state actors). The issues we see today are difficult to analyze though an IR perspective. Since states are powerful institutions, they are expected to react to events but the professionals who work in this area may not have the tools to address these events.I regard study of transnational issues as a valid topic for IR. Student with a geographic focus or greater access through local friends and family may be more successful in predicting and anticipating events but that's not the norm.Edit: To illustrate the point better, the information leaks were an unpredictable but majorly important event. Response from countries has varied and long term effects on relationships will make themselves known. The immediate reaction from the Foreign policy team was probably "well, what are we going to do now?"

21t051	-58338	1396241618	changemyview	CMV: I believe that the Russian entertainment industry should not incorporate American concepts.	CMV: View to change: Russian entertainers should not use, parody, copy, or otherwise incorporate English language media from American entertainers because point 1) it is done with little or no understanding of the original material and point 2) when they do the execution is pathetic and loathsome. Attempts by Russian speaking singers, talk show hosts and others to talk about the American entertainment industry are poorly done. Most of the time the singers are terrible because they do not speak or understand English. Talk show hosts do not have the correct information about celebrity news or do not understand the context in which events take place (for example: asserting that point A. Jennifer Lopez is from Spain and point B. that some contestant on a song trial show sounds exactly like J.Lo). While the idea about globalization of culture as part of Globalization may apply here, I am asserting with confidence from personal experience that what Russian entertainers do is done without context or understanding of the subject matter. Maybe a poor understanding or an odd expert exists but I have not seen that as a major or permanent feature. It is not an example of cultural appropriation because everyone understands the rightful ownership culture (USA). Instead, incorporation of English language American popular media is seen as "American" and separate from Russian artists or performers. In fact, its otherness is seen as an attractive feature.Russian entertainment industry has changed somewhat since the '90s but featured and well known artists are still present on the scene. Addition of American material is seen as an addition to variety but in my view that is not a good reason if the execution is terrible and no one understands what is being sung or discussed.If there is a "demand from the public" to incorporate routines, songs and popular culture from abroad, more specifically America, then it serves to belittle and marginalize the Russian entertainment industry by exaggerating the lack of variety, stale material, lack of new original artists, etc. If this is the case, which is my view then Russia's entertainment industry should bring in more new artists and try to find a new sense of purpose.Although this discussion may touch on Russian identity, global savvy and citizenship, and what have you, nope, I simply think that Russian entertainers are really bad at copying American cultural properties and that improving their performance is the wrong way to go.

22q2yf	-58338	1397163330	changemyview	CMV: I think that an emphasis on Global Warming has politically hurt the environmentalist cause/movement.	CMV: Main claim to dispute: In US politics, instead of emphasizing global warming, activists and politicians should emphasize the harm of air pollution, water pollution, over fishing, over logging, ecosystem collapse and unsustainable practices because these issues are less susceptible to partisan politics and thus more defensible and doable as real policy matters. U.S. politicians' and activist groups' support for global warming awareness/reduction/counter-activity has hurt the cause in 2 ways. 1) global warming has been politicized and attacked by conservatives because it is a large target (undoable, too much invasive big government, reduction in individual freedoms) and 2) specific efforts to battle air pollution (CO2 emissions), water pollution, unsustainable resource use (logging, fishing, and fossil fuels) now fall under combating global warming thus fall under politicized, intransigent, partisan territory.I started listening to an audiobook called "Green Hell" by Steven Milloy, Fox news contributor (and possible secret identity of some Captain Planet villain). In the book the author questions efforts made by Green/environmentally conscious groups and individuals. While I am not convinced about the subject matter in the book; it serves to expose that Green/environmental groups are designated as "the enemy". The book serves as an example of how global warming and green causes have been politically twisted. In U.S. politics, I believe that refocusing on already less disputable, smaller causes like cutting pollution and curbing consumption would be more successful than a large target like global warming. I think that this will shift the conversation towards costs of continuing or cutting pollution and consumption as opposed to partisan political wrangling and politically partisan scientists defending industry funded studies.   To break the argument down to a basic level, an everyday person should agree that fishing too many fish out of a river will reduce the amount of fish available for producing more fish and future consumption. So measures can be taken to let the fish population rise to some acceptable level or continue to fish and risk losing the resource. The costs and benefits of both decisions will be weighted and one option will be undertaken. If the process is politicized then the decision process will be made along partisan lines so the costs and benefits will be distorted.Edit 1: made U.S.A specific thanks to comment.Edit 2: while there's some discussion, I should clarify. I support changing tactics, CMV._____&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

I was with her for over a year, and she was my first real girlfriend. I was the one who had ended it in the first place (due to her overreacting over more sensual things, and the fact that I see her once every month or two), but I realized i still had feelings for her...I am just having a hard time getting over her. Do you have any advice you can give me? I would still like to be her friend in time, but I don't wanna be the douchey jealous ex..

21fwbd	-58353	1395863101	motorcycles	Number of fingers while breaking? I'm hearing conflicting things.	Long time lurker first time poster in this sub, been riding for about a month now and loving every moment of it. One question that I would like to get more experienced riders opinions on is the number of fingers you use when you operate the front break leaver. My MSF instructor informed us that we should always be using all four of our fingers. He said this is because if heaven forbid you lay the bike down your fingers won't get pinched between the leaver and the handlebars. (This is what I have been doing) However I have been reading and watching a few videos online and they have been saying using one to two fingers helps with being more in control.What do you do?

So If you could go back to square one, what are some good riding habits you wish you had reinforced, and what are some bad habits you wish you had never started?

2czw01	-58353	1407518723	motorcycles	So theres this Ducati in my apartment parking lot that hasn't been ridden all season. (Looking for ideas please don't up vote)	I'm looking for some advice or ideas. Theres a Ducati, I forget what year and what model (I' 90% sure some sort of monster series). It was uncovered for about a month when I first moved into the parking lot. It only got covered up with a brown tarp and bungie cord right before a huge storm and hasn't been touched since. I'm hoping to see if he would be interested in selling it for a lower than average price cash in hand. The problem is I have no idea how to get in contact with the owner. We don't have to register bikes at my apartment building so the office doesn't have any idea of who owns it. I previously lifted it up ever so slightly to slid a kick stand stand? (What are those things technically called?) underneath it as it had started to slowly sink into the pavement. I left a note saying I was the guy with the CB500X parked right next to it and my apartment number and phone number, just so the owner would know it was somebody who also owned a bike that had touched his.  However the note has sat on the tarp for about a week now and doesn't seem to have been touched. Anyone have any ideas on how to track down the owner? 
2dmxp3	-58353	1408113589	motorcycles	Jobs you can do on a motorcycle	So I've recently taken up a part time job with Postmates. It's an Uber type app for food and alcohol delivery.

2e6ps6	-58353	1408634269	motorcycles	High quality, good looking leather jackets without huge logos on the front. Anyone have recommendations?	I ride in full Hi-Viz for commuting and when I'm on the highway. However Im starting to get sick of looking like a traffic safety bumble bee whenever I try to go out on the motorcycle. I really want to get a jacket that has the motorcycle cut to it, but without looking like I'm about to hit the track. I've been looking at high quality leather jackets from companies like Alpinestars and Dianese. However it seems just about everything has huge ugly (IMO) logos stuck right on the chest. Safety is a **huge** concern for me, I really want something I can put some high rated armor in. Would love something that worked white into the jacket. Anyone have any suggestions? Edit:: Duh.. budget would be helpful of course. I don't really want to spend over the $450-$500 range.

The sale is expected to start on the 18th, but can I buy games out here on my steam account without having any problems? I can't use my card cause otherwise my bank will think my card has been stolen, so can I use a voucher in a different currency? Could I set up a new account and gift the games to my main account? It would my whole account lock out if I try to buy something because I'm on the otherwise if the world? Preferably I would like to buy games myself instead of messaging my friends and asking them to buy games and gifting them to me then paying them back then I get home. Thanx in advance

wenxh	-58359	1342042836	Dreams	Weird psychic dream 	I am studying abroad in Italy and so far I am having the strangest dreams lately. Well on Tuesday, I had this very scary dream that a gypsy with a very scrunched face with no mouth was just walking towards me. She was holding a man's torso who's arms had been cut off. I rmember waking up and remembering almost all of it (a lot of stuff had happened) but it was the most vivid dream I had ever had. Today is Thursday morning, I can only remember this part. But last night, our teacher was showing us around the city and told us that: to shame a family, some of the bodies were hung in public and then cut down; the people took their bodies dismembered them and carried the torsos with heads and put them in shop windows. This freaked me out because I remember having my dream.IS there any significance to this? I have been having a lot of coincidences like this in my dreams. Can sleep deprivation cause more vivid dreams?TL;DR I had a dream about a severed torso and then learned about it happening in Florence the next day.

xnyfg	-58359	1344070549	Glitch_in_the_Matrix	Dreams	I just stumbled onto this subreddit by accident, but here it goes. I was studying Italian in Italy this summer; for the first couple weeks, I had horrible jet lag and would get up super early and sleep for only 2-3 hours at a time. I had this horrible vivid dream of a gypsy holding a corpse. She had a small face and no mouth and it deeply disturbed me because of how real it seemed because she was standing outside the open market. The next day, our teacher took us out around florence and we learned that one of the Medici family members hung a man outside for days, cut him down so the villagers could  rip off his arms and legs (just a corpse), and placed them in shop windows. I posed this the next day on R/dreams and most people told me teachers have the ability to project thoughts and I might have picked up on it the day before. Anyway, it gave me chills and I think it's very strange. The next couple days I would dream vividly in a similar to this (jet lag haha).TL;DR Had a dream about a gypsy holding a corpse and learned about how it really happened in the town I was living in.

10zhyw	-58359	1349429927	conspiracy	What's up with the facebook propaganda ads? My reasoning to delete Facebook. 	I'm a journalism student and every day we are taught to question everything presented to us. After a friend told me of the 9/11 "conspiracy" and how our government lied to us, something inside of me clicked and I began to see the big picture with media. Media: the fourth wing of government; the mouth to the all seeing eye; the propaganda it spews to force the masses into their agenda. I downloaded Ad-blocker (how hypocritical of me; my focus in Journalism is Advertising).  I see how much money companies spend to advertise their products on bull-shit, one-sided idiots rant about insolvable problems. It's all just a bunch of propaganda, pro-america bull shit.Though social media sites and internet freedom of speech; countries under hard-rule begin to use these mediums to protest and question their governments. However with restrictions to country's internet freedoms and digital privacy being violated, facebook and other popular social media sites are losing steam. It's beging to fill with mindless garbage, advertising, and games. Basically the best distraction since TV. People just spend hours drooling over their status in society, trolling "friends," and idly watching their lives being liked away into narcissistic nothingness.Now, viewing Facebook just a couple of minutes ago, I see an ad--strange, I have ad-blocker.I mine as well see it, it must be a in-house Facebook promotion. After seeing a pathetic attempt to gain an emotional following to Facebook and why we should continue to use the site...I'm currently logging in for. I just don't get it. I see so many aspects of the "Kony" video in this promotion to brand Facebook with chairs (Because the Republican party didn't have enough trouble with empty chairs). I just don't see why they are doing this. It's like they see that people are loosing interest in Facebook and are begging users to "become a part of humanity." I guess a Facebook is a new form of social security. Just one more way the government can keep tabs on the public.

So what's up with the Facebook promotional Ads on their home page?I'm a journalism student and every day we are taught to question everything presented to us. After a friend told me of the 9/11 "conspiracy" and how our government lied to us, something inside of me clicked and I began to see the big picture with media. Media: the fourth wing of government; the mouth to the all seeing eye; the propaganda it spews to force the masses into their agenda. I downloaded Ad-blocker (how hypocritical of me; my focus in Journalism is Advertising).  I see how much money companies spend to advertise their products on bull-shit, one-sided idiots rant about insolvable problems. It's all just a bunch of propaganda, pro-america bull shit.Though social media sites and internet freedom of speech; countries under hard-rule begin to use these mediums to protest and question their governments. However with restrictions to country's internet freedoms and digital privacy being violated, facebook and other popular social media sites are losing steam. It's beging to fill with mindless garbage, advertising, and games. Basically the best distraction since TV. People just spend hours drooling over their status in society, trolling "friends," and idly watching their lives being liked away into narcissistic nothingness.Now, viewing Facebook just a couple of minutes ago, I see an ad--strange, I have ad-blocker.I mine as well see it, it must be a in-house Facebook promotion. After seeing a pathetic attempt to gain an emotional following to Facebook and why we should continue to use the site...I'm currently logging in for. I just don't get it. I see so many aspects of the "Kony" video in this promotion to brand Facebook with chairs (Because the Republican party didn't have enough trouble with empty chairs). I just don't see why they are doing this. It's like they see that people are loosing interest in Facebook and are begging users to "become a part of humanity." I guess a Facebook is a new form of social security. Just one more way the government can keep tabs on the public. Maybe I'm overlooking this, maybe it's part of something bigger.2012 is on it's way and Zion is waiting (just kidding!).Thanks for listening if anyone read this.

Anytime I see a girl in tights or above a 7 on the hotness scale today, it just drives me nuts and makes me want to play with 'em. I have almost done it three time sin the last hour but talked myself  down. Also, I have been sexting my girl and looking at some arousing things (girls in tights not just nude). However, I am still feeling empty, alone, and now even more awkward when I wasn't doing this. When will I feel the amazing confidence? I did for a couple days but not lately. I just feel so horny right now.

They need me to fill out an application where there will be a section where i list any charges or misdemeanors. Two years ago, I was on diversion for an Minor in possession of alcohol that is now up and just says 'diversion agreement' or something like that on my record and I had another one just this last August where I had to plead guilty. My question is this: should I put down both charges or just the second MIP that actually shows up on my record. I'm a little confused on what I should put down before they do the background check. TL;DR Should I put down that I plead guilty for an Minor in possession (alcohol) AND that I was on diversion?

2bs55n	-58359	1406385889	relationships	Me [22 M] broke up with my girlfriend [22 F] and I need some advice or someone to talk to.	My girlfriend and I just moved out to Colorado after graduation. Before the move, things were okay between us, a few fights but nothing too bad. We have been here for about a month and a half and just broke up on Wednesday night. She ended it and left with some friends the next day. She tells me we are still in love and wants to some day get back together. She also said she is not committed and can't make promises. We would have to face a long term relationship anyway because she is moving to Guatemala for two years. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. On one hand our relationship was failing and on the other I love and care for her so much. A little background, we had been getting in fights more and more frequently. She has threatened to leave a couple times and actually broke it off twice but we managed to try it again and stay together. The majority of the fighting was my fault. I would come home in a bad mood or some little thing would spark an argument or unnecessary talk. She and I had both lost patience with each other and it was clear this was ending. She is moving to Guatemala in 3 weeks and we just got to each other's wits-end. She has yelled some pretty harsh things and I don't know what to do about this. Is it worth it?We had been dating for about a year. She went home with my friends (a couple) who had come up for the weekend to interview for jobs. They are a lot like us but had to see us at our worst. My girl friend went home with them and I fear they might break up too. They have been having problems as well and I am starting to suspect if the guy and my ex are talking. I know this sound suspicious but his girlfriend called me and told me they have been hanging out a lot and their relationship wasn't so strong either. My ex told me she was out with a friend and that we would talk at another time. She also told me that the guy was curious if they would last long distance and that he didn't know if he should experiment with other girls. This just makes me nervous and I want to believe my ex wouldn't move on so quickly. We still tell each other we are still in love and one day it might work. I hate being here alone because I don't have any friends and she was the only person I would confide in. I hate this situation and wish I didn't blow this relationship. I have a few questions. I know this is not a lot of information but I want to see what you guys think... Should I bring up if she actually went out with the boyfriend of my friend? She tells me she wants to wait and also that she has no commitment; when she talks about love and sex she has always said they were separate, I feel like I'm still getting jealous and I'm out of my place for feeling so. Is this right? I want to change for the better and try to make this work. ---   **tl;dr**: My girlfriend and I broke up and I want her back. Is this relationship dead or should I hold on? I don't know what to do.

I graduated school in May with a degree in Journalism (emphasis on advertising and marketing) and business from the University of Kansas (rock chalk!). I have a really good job in Denver at an ABC TV station. However, my girlfriend just recently moved to Guatemala to become a 1st grade teacher at an american school ([this one](http://www.cag.edu.gt/)). It is an amazing school and the students are awesome.Now, I hate my job and don't find it fulfilling at all. I have been interested in teaching but didn't really pursue it until later in my college career...too late to change my major. I spoke with the principle for middle school (that is what im interested in) and she said that if I get  my certification to teach (because it is a private school) within a year, she would consider hiring me. They even offer it online! I know this wouldn't include student teaching, and this concerns me. I want to be the best for the students there and we even talked about a year of student teaching before I got into the class room. I would love to teach literature, english, history or language arts.Where could I get this certification so I could take the Praxis exam? I really want to do this so I can start and move by August of next year.  TL:DR I want to become a teacher. Are there online programs to get my certification for international teaching?

However, my girlfriend just recently moved to Guatemala to become a 1st grade teacher at an american school ([this one](http://www.cag.edu.gt/)). It is an amazing school and the students are awesome.Now, I hate my job and don't find it fulfilling at all. I have been interested in teaching but didn't really pursue it until later in my college career...too late to change my major. I spoke with the principle for middle school (that is what im interested in) and she said that if I get  my certification to teach (because it is a private school) within a year, she would consider hiring me. They even offer it online! I know this wouldn't include student teaching, and this concerns me. I want to be the best for the students there and we even talked about a year of student teaching before I got into the class room. I would love to teach literature, english, history or language arts.Where could I get this certification so I could take the Praxis exam? I really want to do this so I can start and move by August of next year.  TL:DR I want to become a teacher. Are there online programs to get my certification for international teaching?

2ftb33	-58359	1410189719	LDR	A wave of anxiety. A couple of questions and in need of advice.	Hello fellow LDR people! I am in a brand new long distance relationship with my girlfriend. We have been dating for a year now and we have been doing this long distance for about a month and a half. We almost had our fallout and broke up with the stress of her leaving and mundane things started causing us to fight. We broke up with the intentions of improving ourselves, she left to go teach abroad in Guatemala and after two days we decided we were meant to be.Now I have every intention of marrying her but the reality is starting to sink in. While we are living our own lives, I wont be able to live with her for three years. Last night I told her about how I was feeling anxious and worried about us. This didn't go over so well. Partly because I was a little angry about her going back on her word a little. Just small stuff like, "I'm going to stay in tomorrow" or "we should have a Skype date this weekend" where she ends up just going out with her friends. Now I should NOT get jealous or angry she did this because we have to have the expectation that we are living our own lives and trying to make this work. I have 100% security in us but it was just the last straw on the camels back when she did it again. I told her how I felt and it resulted in us getting in an argument. However, we figured it all out within an hour and were okay but I think I gave her a shock in how hard this might be.We are still finding our groove and the relationship right now is in a learning curve as we figure out our routines. We give each other our all and talk very chance we get. I just had a weak moment and doubted her commitment. I regret this and feel horrible.I have a couple of questions and need a little advice. Am I putting too much into this? I feel like I wait around for every opportunity to talk with her. I love her so much but I don't want to smother her. The reality of three years is kicking in (Luckily she has a teachers schedule of winter, spring and summer break). What can I do to make sure the passion stays alive? We Skype sex and talk all the time. I just don't want us to drift apart. The anxiety is rooted in our argument yesterday and a bad dream I had of us loosing touch last night. While we made up I want to ensure I continue to be a great man. While I wasn't last night, I want to make it up. Does anyone have an idea how I can?TL;DR: I am anxious about a three year long distance relationship. I love her with all my heart and last night we got into a fight because I was irrationally angry and hesitant about each other.

She said she can help me with my goals (pay off student loans, save (growing my money), travel and invest (still have enough to have fun)). She said they are not owned by any company so they aren't going to push me into products to make them the most commissions. Yet, I feel like I can do this myself. Where can I find the best information on where to invest my money? Because I am only looking to invest $200-300 a month, she mentioned that she would like me to bring her on other clients because she will be doing a lot of work for not a huge payoff, she will explain this more during out second meeting, is this fishy??I looked into a financial adviser because I am thinking of changing careers. With my current job I have a vanguard 401(k) and the new position doesn't have a 401(k) plan. I want to pay back my loans in the most effective way possible and save up for retirement.Should I look into ways to do this all myself?

I enrolled in the payment plan and now pay $88 per month, every month. If I I hadn't enrolled I would have paid $32 this month. It is good for budgeting but I'm starting to wonder if I am leaving money on the table. Would I have been better of just paying a lot during winter and practically nothing during the summer? I have burned about 2 hours on this and have gone cross eyed tracking commodity prices. Has anyone figured this question out?

1h0ngx	-58403	1372133657	cordcutters	Business plans could be more expensive but exponentially better than residential plans.	So I will spare you all the hate stories I have for my cable provider. What I have started to look into is creating a business account (my dog's named nugget so I'm calling my business nugget enterprises). I am fed up with all providers. It seems like every 2 years I switch because my bill creeps up and up. I don't want to keep doing this dance of calling every 6 monts for the promotional rate. I want to move on with my life. Most providers have business divisions and these are separate from the residential divisions with their own policies, promotions and pricing.It seems I can lock nugget enterprises into a rate for 3 years instead of the 2 years offered by the residential side.  Which means I get one full year of not dealing with this bullshit. Over the rest of my life this adds up to 8 times I will not have to contact my cable provider. ( I think I have 50 years left in me).It looks like I would pay a premium for the service in the first year but by the third year I would be paying below market. I also am able to price plans better with out the $59 for 6 months and get a $300 gift card bait and switch.Has anyone done something similar?Has anyone been successful in locking in a 5 year rate or longer?

It is at the mouth of the largest river network in westros, by my amateur estimates the black water rush is 1/3 the size of the trident. Salt pans should be the largest city in westros, not kings landing.Have you noticed that there is no city at the end of the Mander? The Mander is the second largest river in westros. Old town should be at its delta. But old town is at the end of a river 1/10 the size of the Mandor!The Swanns of Stonehelm are supposed to be powerful stormlanders due to its strategic river location, but the river it sits on is incredibly short!Has anyone else noticed this? It cannot be explained by the need for deep water ports. The wooden ships used would not have a very deep draft.I have noticed white harbor, Volatis, sunspear, and Meeren are logical.

Cargill is the largest privat company in the US. And I want to know how to get shares. Since it is not public, I can't buy it through my broker. I have tried looking for mutual funds or exchange traded funds which may hold a percentage of Cargill but have been unsuccessful.Does anyone know of a product which focuses on privately held companies? There are loads of other privates I like: subway, ALDI, Johnson (a family company). I could get some exposure by buying private equity or Goldmann, but there is a lot of baggage I have to take for that one hundredth of a penny of my investment dollar actually going where I want it.Why do I want Cargill? I see their prospects increasing as climate change progresses. With less arable land and more humans to feed, I'm bullish on Argo as a longer than strategic positition.Why don't I just buy Monsanto and move on with my life? Good question.

1jh4li	-58403	1375334000	Eve	I picked up eve in 2005ish but never got into it. What could I have been?	Eve has been in the press recently. I vividly remember the second annual Iceland fanfest in a newsletter for some reason. And I don't really  remember why I didn't keep on the game but I didn't. I'm pretty sure it wasn't offline and I wanted a game I could play without the Internet.If I had been playing for the last 8 years maybe 5 hours a week how big would my assets be? I am thinking about all that compounded interest , build times, and lost potential. What do players look like after playing for 8 years? I probably would have been on the passive side, mining more than looting. I'm an accountant by day so reading all this stuff about eve gives me sort of a spread sheet boner.
1jh7jh	-58403	1375337204	Accounting	Is the time value of money less important now than it has ever been?	CONTEXT: cash position is beyond fine. Hurdle rate is about 6%, the rate on debt held.CFO told me the senior accountant to diminish late fees and overnight check costs. I look at the situation and decide paying early is logical. So I identify all the reoccurring costs like phone bills, rent, Internet, ect. For example:I know that the phone bill,is going to be somewhere around 8.2k or 8.1kSet it up as reoccurring on the first of the month as 8k, pay the voucher without the invoice around the 10th. My direct boss the controller was hip with this and (great guy boss) gives the thumb up.On the 28th VZ generates 8.32k bill against a credit balance and sends us a $320 bill which we get around the 3rd of the next month. This is crunch time and the $320 invoice can afford to be entered after the close. This worked great. 4 straight months no late fees. And bonus benefit of compressing the close effort.CFO gets wind of what I'm doing when I pay a $2,400 rent bill 3 weeks early. We had been paying $40 to overnight checks to them. He puts the stop on my pay early pay often doctrine. He wants to stretch the vendors. Now I am stuck babysitting aging reports making sure no late fees happen. But they are. And I'm not doing other valuable things like balance sheet recs. It is really frustrating to have this happen. I understand the concept of stretching AP and accelerating AR, but that business school textbook chapter was written in 1979. There was 15% inflation and labor was cheap. Now capital is cheap and labor expensive. How would you convince my boss's boss that releasing payment 20 days early increases retained earnings more than letting that money sit in the bank ?

No debt. 6 months of expenses in a savings account. We have extra money left over each month and now have started buying MYD in a brokerage account.(25% tax rate on our 1040 so I went with muni bonds). I'm starting to have the unenviable problem of what to do with all our money.I'm wondering if bond funds are the best intermediate savings vehicle or if I should diversify with another vehicle. This is more of a new car, house remodeling, 5 year semi liquid holding. I DO NOT want to put it in a Roth. We both started Roths when we were teens and now our marginal rate is higher.I have the tax free income of MYD reinvesting but may turn it off in the distant future to fund Roth contributions.Edit: not considering 1% money manager. **EDIT: great comments all of you. I am going to ditch the money market entirely and go Roth. I did not know about the option to withdraw contributions only without recourse.**

1kiamm	-58403	1376682685	personalfinance	How to get my Roth to be less like a brokerage and more like an 401k.	I have a ROTH that is like a money market account. I can hold any exchange traded security in it. I call my broker and place trades. What I don't like is any contributions or dividends sit idle until I make a trade. I much prefer how my 401k works where any new money is immediately allocated by preset percentages.I would like to start making weekly Roth contributions but I don't want that cash to sit idle and the transaction costs are prohibitive to do weekly trades. I would like the $50 a week to just be divided like 401k contributions are. That way my money is working sooner and I don't have to think about my Roth as much or at all. I may start a new hobby with all the time I will be saving not thinking about my roth so any hobby suggestions are welcome. Don't say golf. I hate golf.

1m0bt4	-58403	1378693507	pettyrevenge	Make me sit in the car wash? I'll make you sit in my fart.	9am this morning the wife and I run a errand. On the way back from said errand she suggests we stop at ALDI's since we don't have any groceries. I go along with it since we did in fact have little to eat at the house. I had woken up still drunk from the night before and my hangover is just starting to pop but whatever, I can power through an ALDI's trip. On the way home from ALDI's she decides she needs to get her car washed. I object saying I'm really hungover and would prefer to just go home but instead we pull into the automatic car wash. I decide to get even by unleashing a long hot and slightly wet fart 5 seconds into the opening rinse cycle. Enjoy that for the next 4 minutes. EDIT: Because I'm a mediocre redditor I left out an important detail. My wife used the driver side controls to vent the car, alternating windows based on where the water jets were spraying. So the gas chamber effect was diminished. In an act of meta revenge, she purposely opened my window to get me a little wet.

It had a Washington DC return address and a graphic of the majestic North American bald eagle. It's a complete scam. If I wanted a copy I could get it from the courthouse for like $10. I ignore it but they send a second and third letter. Finally on the fourth I had enough. Each mailing came with a postage paid return envelope. So I filled two of them (I threw the rest away before this) up with pencil shavings and put them in the mail. Next time I will send glitter assholes.

I'm trying to replace a coffee habit with a tea habit. I've been burning through the tea I buy at the grocery store and think I can do a smarter job buying it. Loose leaf tea wasn't working because it is a mess to cleanup at my work so I switched to tea bags. (My work does not like tea leaves in the sink). I'm thinking about putting loose leaf tea into a disposable paper tea bag and then putting that inside of the tea ball.

We took a few hefty Nips from it sat down on one of the couches and decided crate and barrel is not that bad a store. This was over 17 hours ago so the booze was not poison. This got me to thinking how/why the bottle was even there in the first place? Was it bought by some manager who didn't think to use an empty bottle of booze? Did I just drink an employees secret stash? What possible explanation could there be? The bottle was full. I found it about 9 months ago and when I came back to the store last night it was still there.

This will be a pretty large shower about 4’x6’. I am considering how I can to do a steam shower I have 2 options, both are comparable prices.1)	Build the enclosure myself with tiled walls and ceilings and find a door. (I plan on contracting the tile work because it looks like ass when I’ve done it in the past). 2)	Buy a pre built unit: http://www.steamshowersinc.comI keep going back and forth on the Pros and Cons of each. The prebuilt one is definitely easier but I wonder how well they hold up. Reviews on these are hard to find but I’m already doing a ton of DIY on this bathroom and this seems like a good idea since I’m average on how handy I am. Tiling the whole thing out and installing the components myself might hold up better over time. But I haven’t found a ton of useful information on doing this. Most guides focus on showers, not steam showers. There are cleaning concerns, properly ventilation and designing it so I don’t cook myself to death in it. I like to think there was some engineering done in the kits to keep mouth breathers from killing themselves. Any help, guidance, tips, pointers, and product recommendations will be greatly appreciated.

I made concessions to my buyers based on their anxiety about the age of the furnace. I came down 6k and gave an additional year of home warranty coverage. The inspection report came back with a cracked heat exchanger and now they want me to give them the money to put in a new furnace. I feel like I'm being taken advantage of.

30ylnk	-58403	1427830109	RealEstate	Buyers termed sales agreement an hour before the post inspection negotiation period ended. They sent an email the next morning accepting our last counter offer.	This is in Pennsylvania. There are some other details about dealing with these people but I’ll just put the relevant info here. When we negotiated the sales price of the home (in February) the buyers brought up the age of the furnace installed in 1989. We gave a concession on the sales price for a replacement furnace and an extra year of the home warranty. The inspection report came back with a cracked heat exchanger and a date of manufacture in 1984. So pointed out the age of the furnace is 30 years instead of 25 as we disclosed that information to make it sound like we misrepresented ourselves in the disclosure. They wanted us to install a new equivalent furnace or give credit. We said we already gave concessions on the furnace, and it being 30 years or 25 doesn’t change that it was end of life and we are not willing to negotiate on this inspection issue. They came back and asked we pay for a super premium high efficiency furnace. We said no we were only willing to pay for half of an equivalent furnace. They countered that they wanted us to pay for the entire equivalent furnace. We said no and we got their notice of termination 3 hours before the deadline which guarantees the return of their deposit money. We woke up the next day and canceled the movers since the close was in 5 days. Mid day we get an email saying that they have reconsidered and want to accept our last offer to pay for half. Now the agents are trying to salvage the deal with a revised closing date. My questions are does their email reconsidering our last offer revoke the termination letter they sent the night before? Are we under any obligation to agree to terms we conceded during the duress of midnight hour negotiations with our original close date in jeopardy? It is also now peak season and we think we can find better buyers. Do you think I can keep the deposit money? When I ask my agent these questions he only wants to talk about salvaging the failed negotiations.

If you pay that amount each month you will pay your mortgage off in 22 years. I like this as an alternative to the 15 or 30 year fixed. For example: If you are required to make a 1,200 a month payment make a 1,300 mortgage payment instead.

So in my honest opinion (idk if any one else has noticed) but I think that house of wolves has made destiny easier, especially for those who just started the game. I've seen this first hand because my 7 year old brother just started playing about 4 weeks and is already level 30 and I have been playing since day one and didn't reach level 30 until about two weeks after TDB came out, then when HoW came out I got all of my characters to 33 and 34 just a week in (mainly due to all the vangaurd marks I had however I've gained much better armor now) but yeah just a little thing I noticed. Tldr; destiny seems to be much easier since HoW especially for new players.

If i go to bluetooth devices only the controller shows up and i've gone through and tried tweaking setting and I also can't seem to find a "detect bluetooth device" which most bluetooth compatible media have. I was hoping somebody on this board could help me solve my issue so i have proper chat from now on. Note: the sound works fine its just when it comes to using voice communications that that headphones are registering ergo i can't use the chatAlso, if i plug in that stupid little jack meant for xbox controllers into the playstation controller i do get outgoing audio from my mic. But, thats annoying and not how the headphones are supposed to be used

I remember like a year or so ago we had the cypher being passed around from pros to big youtuber's and even the voice acters for champs, last i saw it was passed off to Meteos and i never saw him release a video and i don't think I've seen a new one since. If they dont start getting a new one going we should start to see if we could get the original makers to start it again.Link to the 2013 cypher which didnt go as far as the 2012 cypher, lets get it going again for 2015https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlUpWwaJtnY&amp;list=PLvlez7dmGhpO0Th93lJJ8OV_biltVKoYb

People be complaining about no Zac or Jinx Skin, who cares Zed hasnt gotten a new skin yet, and before anybody says "Well he got the SKT skin" NO! Thats a bullshit Cop-out, If he hadnt been used in the worlds that year he wouldn't have gotten a skin, i mean fuck Vi Came out right after Zed and she got 2 new skins already, Elise came out right before Zed and she also got two new skins (granted one of them was the victorious skin so same arguement about SKT skin could be made) but still. The fact Remains that Zed is one of the newer champs who is still lacking a NEW skin not the SKT recolor because Faker was a god using him but a Legit skin that is for him.

1qztjp	-58430	1384886413	Supernatural	Question about Cas and Sam and the demon trials	Ok so last season when Sam was doing the demon trials, Cas told Dean that there was nothing he could do to heal Sam, that the trials would kill him. Which of course led to Dean intervening, etc etc. So now Sam is up and around totally fine and Cas isn't suspicious? WTF?! He may not know that Zeke is possessing and healing him, but he should definitely realize something is off. Sam went from dying to coma to totally fine person. Cas is not stupid, how hasn't he figured it out? Or did the writers just overlook this?...
1qzvnv	-58430	1384887686	atheism	My problem with religion (your opinions welcome!)	However many thousands of years ago Jesus and Muhammad (and whatever other religious figures) went around telling people they were the son of god or a prophet. And people just accepted it, like it was completely normal. Maybe they were just insanely gullible or superstitious. Christianity and Islam spread, and now they're two of the largest religions. Now fast forward to today. If someone guy (or chick, lets not be sexist) went around saying he was the son of god, he would be put into a mental hospital and examined. Am I right? It almost makes me think that people in Jesus' time or Muhammad's were like the Manson family, just bought into whatever their charismatic leader said. In my mind, that's all religion is. Some guys with mental disorders who managed to convince a bunch of gullible idiots they were the real deal. And it was just passed on down the generations. I seriously can't believe people buy into this crap! I mean really. Let me know what you think! 
1r6gzi	-58430	1385078877	greysanatomy	Spoiler: Theory on Bailey	Ok so with the brief preview earlier this week where Meredith moves Bailey's instruments and Bailey freaks, I think it has to be OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder).

1rus1q	-58430	1385926401	orangeisthenewblack	Just finished Season 1! Spoilers	My friends have been on me about watching OITNB, saying it's amazing, and until yesterday I kept putting it off til later. Well I just finished the whole season and it was amazing!! Even though it's set in a prison and all these women have done bad things, it's hard not to just fall in love with some of them. I personally adore Red, for being a total badass, Sophia because she's sweet and even though she was born a man, she's a classier lady than every other woman there. All in all the cast of characters is pretty great. I am super freaked out by Tiffany and Healy though... His sudden turn around from super nice guy to Mr. I'll-let-you-get-shanked-in-the-yard... *shivers* Everyone feel free to weigh in on who you love or hate, and what you think is coming next season!!

1taaqh	-58430	1387497093	OCPD	Curious if this is an OCPD symptom	I don't know for sure if this is just me being.. odd... or a symptom of OCPD. Please let me know. Here it is:I have this tendency to get very obsessive about various subjects for a short period of time. Most recently it was after I watched the documentaries "The Whale" and "Blackfish". Now I have always loved animals (except snakes), I have two cats whom I love as my own kids. But after watching these documentaries I got really angry about the treatment of Orca's. So I started seriously researching how to help them. Sign up for animal defense funds (or is it foundation?), sign petitions, donate, etc. But the intense obsession only lasts about 2 weeks or so. I'm not saying I don't still care about the Orca's, I very much do, but I've lost my intense focus and obsession. This happens to me all the time, with various subjects.Is it just me who does this? Or is it a symptom of OCPD? Let me know please!!
1th0yd	-58430	1387737320	greysanatomy	Feb 27th	Ok seriously, why the hell does it take almost 3 months for Grey's to come back on air??? It's the last show to come back on air (of the one's I watch). Big Bang Theory comes back Jan 2nd. The day AFTER the holidays!! Yet Grey's fans have to wait until the end of Feb. WTF?! Have they not filmed it yet or what??? *anger*
1unhl1	-58430	1389128286	lostgirl	Lauren	I honestly cannot stand her. She is AWFUL! So irritating and needy and obviously not even close to enough for Bo. I watch Grey's Anatomy and this is beginning to feel extremely reminiscent of the Meredith and Derek crap. They're together, they're not together... etc. But in this story, Dyson is Derek, Dyson is Bo's soul mate and we all know that they absolutely must be together! So wtf is up the the Lauren and Bo dance?! Can't the show just get rid of her? Dyson was willing to give up his wolf for her, become human to save her (The Norn lied but that's not my point). He lost his love to save her. Plus, wolves mate for life. Bo is the only one he will ever love, why is Bo still fucking around?!?! And what exactly has Lauren brought to the table? I'm not saying she isn't intelligent, she is. But I mean what does she bring to the Bo relationship table? Oh wait, nothing. That's what she brings. Get rid of her writers!! Put Bo and Dyson together!!!

1vv0zg	-58430	1390409585	Supernatural	First Born possible error	Previously (season 4 I think) it was stated that Lillith was the first demon, the first human soul Lucifer corrupted. But with tonight's episode, Cane had to have been the first demon, Cane was one of the first human beings (if you go by the bible, which this episode seemed to). So is that just a glaring mistake on the writers part? 
1wiuqs	-58430	1391049998	AmericanHorrorStory	Hopes for Season 4!!	I've been thinking that it would be kinda cool for Jessica Lange to play a "good" character. Don't get me wrong, I love all her AHS performances. But she has always kinda played the bad guy. Constance was a murder and just a crazy selfish bitch, Sister Jude was a bit of a masochist with the whipping (although she did kind of make up for it a the end of the season), and Fiona is a horribly selfish bitch. So I would love to see her as a good guy next season! And on this same train of thought, I want to see Sarah Paulson as a bad girl! Billie Dean was nice (even though it was a small part), Lana was so sweet, almost the whole time a victim (she did kick ass later on though), and now Cordelia is the kind and gentle instructor. She truly cares for the girls and does her best for them. So let's get a role reversal for Jessica and Sarah!!

1z3xg9	-58430	1393528085	thewalkingdead	[SPOILERS] Possible theory on illness	Now that the prison has been destroyed and everyone is on the run, I'm wondering about those who were infected with the mysterious illness. Now I know Daryl and Bob and all them brought back medication and everyone appears to be on the mend. However, Glenn still seems to be weakened, for instance when he passed out with Tara and Abraham and his group found them.So here's my thought- even though the infected seem to be healing, are they still contagious? Lizzy was sick, could she infect Judith? Or if they meet others at Terminus could their illness then spread to that new group of people? Or could Glenn spread his illness to Tara, Abraham, Eugene, or the other chick? Anybody else think about this??
1z3ykh	-58430	1393528701	OCD	New here!	Hello everyone, I was diagnosed about two years ago with OCPD (Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder) and have now been informed by a new psychiatrist that that may be a misdiagnosis. My symptoms point more towards OCD than OCPD, but my doctor is not so stupid as to diagnosis in one session. But I know myself well and of course being obsessive have been researching each disorder and talking to people about the differences. I'm sure everyone here understands it's a hard thing to live with, and hard to talk about with people who don't also experience it. Personally, when I talk to my friends about it they look at me like I'm an alien. They can't understand my need to organize and alphabetize my world. So hopefully I'll be able to talk to people here about some of these things! 
21zcg3	-58430	1396406138	faceoff	Confused about remaining episodes	I was looking through the syfy schedule and saw that there are 3 more episodes- Bloodsuckers on Apr 8, Cry Wolf on Apr 15, and Heavenly Bodies on Apr 22. Now in the previous seasons when it got down to 5 contestants there was a double elimination and then we would have the final 3. So including tonight's episode, I would have thought next week would be the finale. But no, there are two more episodes after what should be the finale. So what's going on? No double eliminations? Are they bringing someone back? 
25tfj9	-58430	1400361055	greysanatomy	Richard's taste in women	I don't know why I was thinking about this, but has anyone noticed that all the women in Richard's life are quite similar? The women he's in relationships with- Ellis, Adele, and Katharine. All strong, powerful, dominating women (Adele a little less than the others but she still scared Richard a little). He exclusively dates these types of women. And then add in Bailey who is in my mind his best friend. She is also dominating and strong, the same as the women he is sexually involved with... Just thought it was interesting how much of a type Richard really has!!

2dr886	-58430	1408229329	HemlockGrove	Epiphany about Roman &amp; Letha (possible spoilers)	So I'm re-watching the series and I think I just figured out why Olivia made Roman rape Letha. Roman is Norman's son, the only Upir child Olivia ever had. We know she killed the first daughter she had by JR, and I think it's safe to assume that Shelley is JR's child as well (hence how she wound up dead and then resurrected). So I think Olivia decided that Norman's genes were the ones she needed for an Upir grandchild and guess what? Norman just happens to have a daughter! So she made Roman rape his half sister in order to produce what we think is an Upir grandchild but seems to be far more powerful than either Roman or Olivia. What do you all think?
2l0y7h	-58430	1414890163	Supernatural	Garth - Kate	Why didn't Sam and Dean just take Kate to (or tell her where they were so she could go by herself) Garth and his wife and father-in-law???? They're werewolves that don't eat humans, Kate would fit in there, have a family and a support system, instead of trying to do it alone. Such an easy damn fix. Seriously.

She specifically told Vanessa that only full humans (which Ethan clearly is not) can pass. I assume Vanessa can pass either because the cut wife said the spell the first time and perhaps that grants her a lifetime pass if you will, or because the house belongs to her now, she can come and go as she pleases. Either way, with Ethan not being full human, he should not have been able to pass through the stones at the front without Vanessa having said the spell. Thoughts on why he was able to walk right through???

So, I'm off to a decent start. My question now is, what kind of receiver should I be looking out for as I scour the thrift stores and storage units of my family? I know it would be best to get a Pioneer receiver, but online and in store they are pretty pricey, so is there another brand of receiver that would work well with my turntable?Thanks!

20n2zr	-58440	1395075190	books	What protagonist made you realize something you didn't want to know about yourself?	I finished reading *The Fall* by Albert Camus last night and I had to take a moment to collect my thoughts. This man clearly wishes to manipulate and keep people wrapped around his finger, but his reasons for doing so are quite a shade of grey. His ontology for believing in the guilt of all, though rash at times, matched up with my own beliefs. It made me realize that as in our relationships with people there is always a goal to reach, and that is to benefit ourselves alone. To tie ourselves to friendships is to initiate an ambition to become higher than somebody else. However, this quote contradicted his belief, "...but to be happy it is essential not to be concerned with others."Though self-centered with individual growth in mind he knows the curse of being identified as a morally just figure by friends, and thus the quote, "May heaven protect us...from being put on a pedestal by our friends." I find myself constantly in situations among my own friends wherein I am the voice of reason, though I have the emptiness gnawing inside which suggests I only talk with them because I need to.In other words, this man I spent over one-hundred pages with listening to his self-indulgent rants ended up resonating with me, and it is a disconcerting revelation. Has this happened with you with a different protagonist?

2710kv	-58440	1401628975	nosleep	Bin-Bag [Part one]	Just past the railroad tracks and around the bend there is a stretch of road blocked off with gate. The road has been abandoned for years following a series of floods back in 2004. The road itself was fine after the storms, but the tunnel the road ran through was destroyed. The concrete came undone, and the streams on either side of the road rose and never fell down.Since then this area has harbored the debauchery of local teenagers, graffiti tagged along the road and haphazard bonfires at the mouth of the tunnel. On autumn nights these activities took place, but during the summer the Road was without much company, and it was peaceful. Thus every other evening throughout June and July I strolled through, usually reading or bathing in the sun.I did this without much thought of the land being owned by one of the locals, a farmer who lived near the Road for many years. The only way one could know he owned the land was by noticing a rusted-out shack on the left-side of the embankment. The inside was shielded by a large sliding door--sometimes it was open, and if hay bales were inside you knew the owner was around. When the doors were closed, however, it meant the harvest season was over and the area would be without much interaction for a few months.One day last month I walked along the Road and saw the door was closed, leaving me to freely move about and take in the scenery. As I approached the tunnel I heard a slam from inside the shack. The wind picked up earlier that day, so I shrugged it off as the door rocking with the breeze. But the slam came again, but I did not see the door move with the wind at all.I stood for a moment and listened, waited. A succession of three hits against the metal, and then silence again. I figured a rat caught himself between the walls and thrashed to free itself, but I wanted to make sure. And I approached the shack, drawing nearer to it until I placed my palm upon the outside paneling. And the slams stopped. I put my ear on the panels and listened again, still silence.Then gradual scratching, first from the far corner of the shack. Then running along the walls, around the corner, gradual and distant, closer then and I could feel the movement vibrating through the metal. The scratching came closer to the ground, and whatever it was was larger than a rat, possibly a raccoon then. I didn't feel like getting bitten, so I moved away, just as I felt a final vibration directly beneath my palm.I walked back to the gate and made my way to the top of the hill, where the railroad tracks run through. For whatever reason I decided to turn around, looked down from the hill back to the shack. And I saw someone walking from the mouth of the tunnel towards the shack. The person was covered in black, I couldn't make out their face, but as the wind picked up again their clothes blew over and flailed like garbage bags wrapped around their entire body. It shined with the sun, it had to be garbage bags. And the person walked up to the shack, slide open the door and entered, closing it behind them.And I heard the slams come again, and through the thrashing panels I heard a muffled cry, but the wind picked up again and the noise bled together so I couldn't make it out anymore.[Part two](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/274fsf/binbag_part_two/)

The wind died down the preceding days, replaced by a heatwave without a breeze. I wanted to get closer to the shack, but I had no idea where the person was, so I waited. A half hour passed without disturbance, but my nerves controlled me, kept me from approaching. Instead I walked along the railroad tracks until I reached the bend which rested upon the top of the tunnel. A thicket of trees obscured my view, but at least I was closer. In the meantime I listened, and there came a soft drone from the shack. At first the sound was heightened, sustained, but gradually turned to sporadic bursts of calls. From below I heard movement in the stream, falling water, and footsteps. I looked through the binoculars, past the branches, and saw the person approach the shack. The garbage bags wrapped around their arms hung loosely, the skin scabbed and reddish-brown--I can't remember, something was off. The person slid open the metal door and entered, sliding it shut as the rusted metal ground against the hinges. And then there was nothing. No sound, save for the passing water below. And I waited. And I waited, nearly an hour passed and the person stayed in the shack. Finally the thrashing metal. The side panels thumped wildly for a moment. And then nothing again.The door slid open, slowly, labored movement. I saw the person standing before the shack. They shut the door, even slower than before and walked back to the mouth of the tunnel. I noticed something dripping on the ground as they walked clutching the left wrist, now bound in a ball of plastic. It looked like grease, but it fell like water.  I waited until the person was out of view before I sat back up, walked along the tracks back to my house. I did not know if they squatted in the shack or somewhere in the area, but the person always wandered off into the tunnel, but I never heard footsteps on the opposite end. So the tunnel became of interest. I staked the place out the next day, around dusk when the sun loomed just beyond the hills. I planned to be there when light remained for at least an hour, thus I could shade myself in the brush if need be. I waited for any movement, any sound--nothing doing, must be gone. I made my way down the road. It felt changed since last I walked there. The stillness unrecognized, no calls from birds or wildlife. An unsettling peace. When I past the shack I noticed charred stains alongside the pasture, circles of ash flecked, with one pile smoldered with white smoke. I neared the mouth of the tunnel, stepped over the broken slabs and sloshed through the stagnant waters on the inside road. The air smelled of wet leaves and moss, but mixed within a faint hint of sickly sweetness--I can't place the smell, but it reminded me of burnt hair. As I made my way through the road I stumbled across an encampment nested against the right wall of the tunnel. Makeshift, torn, moldy blankets draped atop pieces of concrete. Scattered medicine bottles without labels, tin cups and the remains of a campfire. Alongside the ashes there was an old-fashioned iron. When I picked it up, turned it over, fragments of something singed on the bottom fell to the ground. A sickly sweetness, no clothes around. The sun began setting over the hills. I left the tunnel and walked back across the road, but as I past the shack again I decided to take a closer look. There had been no movement since I was around, at least that I noticed. I approached the side of the shack and noticed bullet-holes lined with rust, decades old. I peered in. What appeared to be a workbench, the silhouette of tools scattered about. On the other side in the far corner I saw a medium-sized dog kennel, covered with a tarp, lined and chained with barbed-wire--I saw jagged ends, I assume barbed wire. The size of the kennel, from what I could make out, was larger than what I thought clawed the walls a few days prior. On the ground before the kennel door the ground was moist. I tried to get a better view but the sun had nearly set, not enough light to make anything else out.I could smell bleach from inside, I'm sure it was bleach. There had been no movement or sound since I got there, and when I left the stillness remained intact.

The size of the kennel, from what I could make out, was larger than what I thought clawed the walls a few days prior. An X was crossed on the side of the kennel. On the ground before the kennel door the ground was moist. I tried to get a better view but the sun had nearly set, not enough light to make anything else out.I could smell bleach from inside, I'm sure it was bleach.There had been no movement or sound since I got there, and when I left the stillness remained intact.Over the next few nights I returned to the tunnel, waited for the person to leave, entered and dug through the contents of the camp. Each night brought more prescription medication bottles, stockpiles of canned food, and a thick smell--the sweet sickness, body odor, and stale food. In the far corner of the tunnel I saw a heap of trash bags, and digging a stick through it produced a vapor reeking of iron. But on the last night I went I found a notebook by the campfire. Leather-bound, broken spine, pages torn and mended with layers of tape. I did not take it with me, rather I tore out some of the looser pages and stuffed them in my pockets. No trail, no way of knowing. When I returned home I looked over the pages: Diagrams of the human body, crudely drawn with incisions over specific parts, dates next to the dotted lines and measurements. One near the right ear read, 'March 3rd, 13, 12:27 AM.5 oz'. Another on the right arm, shaded in, 'December 11th, 12, 5:43 AM, 1 lb'. And it went on throughout the entire body, but I noticed the left hand crossed out, no dates or figures. Just gone. The other pages consisted of to-do lists, shopping lists: more meds, more bags, sharper tools, food. A couple nights ago I decided to look around the shack. I wandered the tunnel too many times to come up with anything new, only more empty tins of food and empty bottles. I had not seen the squatter since the time I watched him from the railroad tracks. The noise from the shack died down as well--it seemed I was the only one standing there in the dark. I needed to know if the person finally left.I edged towards the giant metal door and pressed my ear against it. I heard the pulse within my head, but nothing more. So I slid the door open and entered, immediately hit with a wave of heat. The air smelled of bleach, rancid, almost surgical. Before me stood a workbench littered with various tools.I saw a silver tray holding makeshift knives, dulled, some serrated, worn and stained with copper grime. A fillet knife rested at the edge of the workbench, and in the poor lighting of the dust-covered bulb I made out blood, still wet.Beside it was a bucket filled with bleach, cleansing other tools like claw-hammers, pliers, a handsaw. Fragments of grey meat carried to the surface. Some rays of the sun shone from the right of the shack through the bullet holes I peered in weeks ago. I turned around and saw the kennel to the left. The tarp was torn, and the barbed-wire shredded into metallic threads. It looked larger than last time. Bits of meat hung from the grates on the side, some on the door, something pooled from inside. I thought I saw the cropped tip of a finger--I think, it was dark. Then I heard the mumbling. Foot-steps approaching the entryway, and I forgot to close the door. The foot-steps stopped, and for a moment there was silence.It turned to running, and I looked around for a way out and saw a small opening on the back wall, and I jumped out. I ran through the pasture out back, and as I did I saw within the tallgrass dog kennels of different sizes littered, beaten, some torn apart, and one had an X crossed on the side, and it was the smallest. I kept running, and once I turned around I saw the person standing in the pasture, watching me go, and it peeled off the layers of plastic surrounding its head, but I kept running and couldn't see. From my room I hear the faint sound of the metal panels thrashing with the wind. When harvest season begins the doors will open.

I needed to know if the person finally left.I edged towards the giant metal door and pressed my ear against it. I heard the pulse within my head, but nothing more. So I slid the door open and entered, immediately hit with a wave of heat. The air smelled of bleach, rancid, almost surgical. Before me stood a workbench littered with various tools.I saw a silver tray holding makeshift knives, dulled, some serrated, worn and stained with copper grime. A fillet knife rested at the edge of the workbench, and in the poor lighting of the dust-covered bulb I made out blood, still wet.Beside it was a bucket filled with bleach, cleansing other tools like claw-hammers, pliers, a handsaw. Fragments of grey meat carried to the surface. Some rays of the sun shone from the right of the shack through the bullet holes I peered in weeks ago. I turned around and saw the kennel to the left. The tarp was torn, and the barbed-wire shredded into metallic threads. It looked larger than last time. Bits of meat hung from the grates on the side, some on the door, something pooled from inside. I thought I saw the cropped tip of a finger--I think, it was dark.Then I heard the mumbling. Foot-steps approaching the entryway, and I forgot to close the door. The foot-steps stopped, and for a moment there was silence.It turned to running, and I looked around for a way out and saw a small opening on the back wall, and I jumped out.I ran through the pasture out back, and as I did I saw within the tallgrass dog kennels of different sizes littered, beaten, some torn apart, and one had an X crossed on the side, and it was the smallest. I kept running, and once I turned around I saw the person standing in the pasture, watching me go, and it peeled off the layers of plastic surrounding its head, but I kept running and couldn't see.From my room I hear the faint sound of the metal panels thrashing with the wind. When harvest season begins the doors will open.

I am entering my last year of university, and our mainstage show for the upcoming semester is THE GLASS MENAGERIE. For our auditions we need two monologues, specifically the director asked for two contrasting monologues. One of my first questions is this:* Does this mean he wants a serious and a comedic monologue? Or, does he mean monologues with contrasting themes? Furthermore, I am having difficult finding monologues for this audition, and this is due to my nervousness for wanting to be in this show badly. The director is also my acting mentor, and the Glass Menagerie is his all-time favorite play. And so I want to have two great monologues but thus far haven't been able to find much. One of the monologues I have in mind is from WAITING FOR LEFTY by Clifford Odets. I haven't a clue for the second one. So, my second question: * I am looking for a dramatic style monologue for a 23 year old male auditioning for the parts of either Jim or Tom in the Glass Menagerie. What are some recommendations?I asked my other acting professor this and he suggested I actually do a monologue from the Glass Menagerie. This seems really ballsy to me, especially if I use a monologue from the wrong character and the director feels I do not fit the part at all. This same director was also my professor for an advanced acting class I did last semester, wherein he gave me and my scene partner the Jim/Laura scene.This is the show which would capstone my experience in the theatre-program at my university, but my nerves are preventing me from trusting my instincts, especially with selecting monologues.**tl;dr**: Glass Menagerie auditions. Need help finding appropriate monologues. Any advice would be appreciated!Thanks!

What I mean is, I only acknowledge that I've even had a dream a couple times in a year, and of those times I may remember part of one of them. I've had a dream journal for about two thirds of a year now and it has one entry, which I still remember. It was just me driving in a car with my mom, back when I was still learning to drive, and us about to crash into some truck skidding in the road and me swerving around it. Yep, that's it, and it was very un-lucid. This dream was months ago, and I'm starting to think that simply dreaming, not even the lucid kind, isn't for everyone. Is there anything I'm missing here?

I'm currently diamond tier, but that is the result of beating the same steel twice and ranking up instantly. Anyway, I've pretty much only used Phalanx and to be honest, I feel like I'm really missing something. I'm able to win most of the duels that I due to balanced spam, which actually works fairly well. However, I know this isn't a very "diamond level" approach. When I see higher ranked players playing phalanx, I am really taken back by just how intricate they get with some of their combos.What I am really looking for is someone to help me develop a tactic that is a bit less "new playerish". I've been experimenting with charged attacks, but I very rarely land them, along with pretty much any heavy attack. I'm really only comfortable with balanced and fast attacks, and the occasional air attack I will completely miss. I looked up some Phalanx videos on youtube, and specifically watched the official video on side cancelling, and couldn't even remotely replicate the same results. In addition, I tried learning the glide lunge, as well as the extended jump (which works for all characters). Yet again, no satisfactory results. Any help would be appreciated.Edit: Forgot to say, I've been most successful with Jian Phalanx, strangely enough.

This is a bit of a story, but I am desperate. This morning went to turn on my desktop (built it in early jan. runs windows 8.1) and instead of being greeted by a login screen, I get a blue screen that says something like ":( Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart", which it did and kept doing in a loop. I couldn't boot in safe mode or anything so I found my installation disc and tried every form of recovery to no avail, and decided on a reset. It starts and then asks me for the installation disc or recovery media to be inputted. I already had the installation disk in so i basically got stuck here. At this point I opened up my laptop (running on windows 8.0 [it refuses any and all windows updates, cant even update to 8.1]) and tried to create a recovery media to no avail due to the 8.0/8.1 mismatch. I asked my friend states away to do it for me and send me a converted file of the recovery media, but he said he couldn't make it an iso. So I really am stuck here and I need this computer to do my job. Any help would be appreciated and sorry in advance for any lack of tech skill or knowledge I may have/will  show. Thanks so much for any replies, I'm frustrated and paranoid.

2bvnc9	-58459	1406489053	GlobalOffensive	[Opinion] Amount of players slots on casual servers is too damn high!	I enjoy competitive for the reasons anyone does, but in addition, I really love the 5v5 play style for the maps on CS:GO. In my opinion with the current map sizes, it just becomes cluttered and confusing when you go too far above that. I hate it when I get on dust2 just to see it is a 12v12 with 4 awps looking back at eachother mid, where if you lean to one side with enough people you automatically win. This is my preference, and I think its fine if we have servers with large player slots, however, it seems like every time I press play for casual these sizes are all I get. I would love to be able to kind of choose to join games not only based on gamemodes or maps, but also total player slots. I'm willing to wait the extra time for matchmaking too, if that matters. Idk, this is my opinion.

2cjcic	-58459	1407105870	pcmasterrace	I need a pair of cheap ($0-100) headphones for directional positioning in games.	So, I have been using a gamecom 780 for 3 years for all of my directional audio needs in games such as CS:GO. The virtual surround worked, at least until I 'upgraded' to windows 8.1 and have recently started playing CS:GO again. The positioning is off, and I have tracked down the issues to the 780's drivers just not working well with windows 8. I need a new audio device (doesn't need to have a mic) that is up to $100 (cheaper the better, I would really like to say around $50), that can still provide a competitive edge when it comes to positioning in games such as CS:GO. Thanks!

2edgye	-58459	1408810834	Dogtraining	Please help me with neighbors dogs!	So, my neighbors have 3-4 dogs that they will either just let loose throughout their whole backyard or shove inside all day. My family has an acre backyard, that borders theirs with a somewhat old wooden fence. Every time we make a noise outside, or they can get a glimpse of us through the fence, they go crazy, and will continuously bark and jump at the decaying fence even after we leave and go inside, all until our neighbor brings them in. One time the largest (not sure on breeds or names) dove at the fence, and snapped a hole in the fence about 3 feet away from us. You can tell there are many more breaking points in the fence like this due to the dogs jumping at the fence. My dad is in the army, and after being deployed in the sand for 3 years, me and him work hard to keep the lawn nice, so it can serve as a sort of haven for him. However, if he so much as goes to open the shed to grab a lounging chair, all of the dogs go crazy. We've attempted to talk to our neighbors or get to know their dogs, just so we can have some peace, but they always retreat and refuse to own up to the issues their dogs are causing. I'm not sure what to do, but I feel really badly for my Dad, none of us feel comfortable in our own backyard anymore.

However, recently (within the past year) I've noticed that if I were to hold my hand out, in a moment of little physical activity, my hand would always shake quite a lot. I knew this was abnormal. I finally decided to post because during a game of CS:GO I went from doing okay, to terrible, pulled my hands off the keyboard and they were shaking pretty visibly (I know video games can sometimes increase heart rate and cause things like this, so for the record, I was not excited and if anything a little tired). In addition to being worse a video games ( a tragedy, I know), my handwriting, is and always has been terrible, and 10 year old me was better at drawing than current me. I don't know what other information to add, and surely this isn't an imperative issue among the others posted (especially the guy with the peeling penis), but any help would be appreciated, because I'm tired of losing 20 points off of every essay I write because my teacher can't read it.Thanks,Tom

I've also thrown in some games from genre's he's never tried or experienced, in the case he does like them.

2n6msk	-58459	1416767230	Steam	Friend was VAC Banned, need some assistance.	So, my friend and I play a lot of games on Steam together. Recently we've been playing almost solely CS:GO. He's not great, and neither am I, myself going between Nova 1 and SEM, and him floating around Silver 3-4. A couple days ago he was VAC Banned. I can only assume it was for CSGO. He only ever plays competitive with me, and he very rarely does exceptionally well, seeing that he's playing with nova 1's. So, at this point I'm plain confused. He doesn't hack so we're both wondering how this could have happened. He lives in Utah, and occasionally has terrible internet when playing, could that play a part? Does this have to do with the recent VAC bans of pro players abusing the steam workshop? Here's his CS:GO Stats, which include a link to his steam page if needed: http://csgo-stats.com/katonawubs/ Any help on how to proceed would be appreciated, his desktop is pretty messed up at the moment, so I'm researching this for him. Side-note: Please don't just comment "Tell him not to hack" or "There are no false VAC bans" or anything along those lines. He isn't a hacker, or else he would be doing a hell of a lot better at the game. I've known him for 3-4 years, I know that he doesn't cheat. Whether or not he did cheat is not my question here.Thanks for reading and for any help you can provide, despite the fact I know this is going to get down voted into oblivion.

I leave the game for a couple months and come back to it because some of my friends got it, and play with them. I'm a bit worse (still taking first in most matches), and they're terrible, so slowly I deranked continuously.

Basicalyl, I'm doing badly in games I know that I previously would've done exceptional in.My current abilities:Pros: I can get one tap headshots well enough, and I feel I have good game sense.Cons: I can't spray, like at all.

2vb1m7	-58459	1423495687	GlobalOffensive	Can we like, not blame the casters?	I watched both the CLG vs Liquid and the C9 vs Denial matches yesterday, with both lasting far over two hours due to pauses most likely correlated with ddos attacks. I'm waking up this morning to at least two posts at least partially attacking the casters Vansilli and MegamanTV, and I know last night the verbal abuse to these casters was ever present as well in the twitch chat. So, I just wanted to say, these casters are not making the decisions during the matches. They're doing their job, just like anyone. You do not see a caster of a sporting event suddenly go against the officials making calls, and demanding that they be fixed on air, and you also don't see fans watching the sport blame these casters for calls they don't agree with. As for the decisions made by esea during the matches, it seems to me that they were following pre-established rules for esea matches, and that this lead to the matches being continued. If you don't like the rules in place that's one thing, but don't blame the casters for doing their job, and not trying to spark a revolt against esea.Edit: According to esea rules, pause time allowed is only five minutes at a time, so they were bending the rules for these teams during each of these matches.Also, this: http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=627837

30vcdr	-58459	1427761347	GlobalOffensive	If you don't want to communicate with your team, don't play competitive.	I've just played 3 competitive matches. Lost each one. Was I playing against hackers, or smurfs? Well, no and yes. However, the other team isn't why I'm mad about losing. They played good games against me, whether they had a private or 10 hour profile, or not. If I'm beaten by skill, even by a smurf, I don't usually take it too hard.However, I am still pissed about these losses. Why? The communications between my friend and I, and the other members of the teams we were in (who I assume were also queuing together) were non existent other than maybe the occasional callout when we were lucky. It's not like I'm playing in silver games, I'm queued with Nova Masters and MG's. If you're playing a comp, and you want to win, communicate! I don't care if you have a mic (You should) or not, at least use text chat, it's not like making a callout after you die or giving input on strats before the round starts is super hard. Each game was filled with broken buys, and split or slow moving t side rounds. I don't want to have to get a 5 man just to play competitive while still being able to at the very least form basic strategies with teammates.Sorry if this seems whiny, but after being stuck in silver for so long, and finally fixing my own playstyle and mindset, thus making it about halfway through the Nova Ranks, I guess I just expected more.TL;DR: Use your mic or text chat in a competitive match, or you're a loaf of soggy bread.

What do you believe the advantages are, either way.Nitty Gritty - I currently have a more or less solid, but specs-wise, lacking laptop, that turns on and can easily be used to take notes, etc. I also have a Micro-ATX gaming desktop that I made a couple years back.I've saved some money that I intend to only spend on getting my desktop/laptop situation squared away for college, so I decided to ask here what I should go about doing.Do you currently have a desktop, laptop, both or neither? Based on this, how often and to what extend do you use each of these devices?Here's my specific questions; based on the classes that one takes in college, would it be worth it for me to invest this money in a new desktop (or simply upgrading my current build) and keeping my current laptop, or to invest it into a solid laptop that could be used by itself for notes/videojuegos/whatever? Or maybe I should sell my desktop and put everything into a decent gaming laptop that could do all the above.Sorry for the unorganized wall of text above that you've read. Any information or opinions are greatly appreciated. Thanks!

After playing a couple days ago, I had somewhere near 100k in my account and went and purchased some sticky mines, rockets, and a can of fuel, still having quite a lot of money to spare. When I logged in yesterday, I had a total of $108 and none of the items I purchased were there. Was there some sort of rollback? I don't really mind losing these items now, but I dont want this to happen again. What if next time gta online rolls back a supercar I buy or something. Has this happened to anyone else recently?

35btgt	-58459	1431116669	MechanicalKeyboards	[help] Should I Upgrade?	I currently have a CMStorm Trigger with MX Reds. I'm also almost finished building a new computer. I was thinking that since I'm upgrading my comp, I might want to try a new keyboard. I was thinking about buying a new brown switch keyboard, to possibly replace my current Trigger. However, if I didn't I could spend the money on different aspects of my build (such as a monitor). I'm thinking about getting this if any: https://www.massdrop.com/buy/keycool-104-rgb-mechanical-keyboardThe reason why Im hesitant on buying a new keyboard because I know the brown switches are similar to reds, only with a tactile bump, and that I probably really don't need a new keyboard. If it isn't a good idea to get a new keyboard, is there anything I can do/buy to make my trigger a bit nicer?
35iaaw	-58459	1431278603	techsupport	Help Me Identify My Bottleneck	I just built a new rig, (r9 295x2, i7 4790k, 16gb ram, corsair 1050i psu, gigbyte z97 gaming 5 mobo, samsung 850 evo ssd). I installed GTAV and Counter Strike: Global Offensive to run it through it's paces. Counterstrike obviously runs fine, but at max settings, it's frame rate is lower than I expected. However the real issues I've run into have been with GTAV. At settings where only 3/4 of the video card's ram are used (Mostly high or ultra) the game stutters at 15-25 fps, occasionally spiking up to like 50, but only for a moment. I checked my temps, and for the cpu it's usually around 45-50 in GTAV, and the GPU is around 55-60 (not as low as I had hoped, but not as high as I expected from the parts). However, the usage of these two components never approaches more than 60%. Something is wrong, probably done on my part, and I'd appreciate any help in figuring this out.

36u9w6	-58459	1432268226	Worldpainter	[Request] A Snowy Roleplay Map	In the coming months, I hope to create a minecraft roleplay server that is based on a harsh, snowy environment. I'm not great at world painter so if anyone was looking for a unique challenge, or to assist the dying Roleplay genre, I would extremely appreciate it. Here is a little concept I drew up: http://i.imgur.com/cxfdhXo.jpg With darker blue meaning water, and lighter blue meaning ice, and more green meaning a higher density of foliage to white meaning very little to no. Stuff not shown on the little concept I've linked would be that if possible, an immensely higher density of ores would be in the north, to counter-act the higher foliage density of the south. I'm hoping that the very south looks like this: http://whatsupic.com/images/Tamasha/13745617381.jpgand the far north looks like this: http://images.spaceref.com/news/2009/DSC_4299.m.jpgAnything in that concept that wouldn't make sense or you may think is not okay, or would do better in a different part of the map or really any ideas you have, I would encourage going with, as long as it is not too divergent from the concept.Thank you so much for reading and if you in fact do choose to create this map for me, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks again!edit: My username on skype is "Lookaquarter", if you'd like to add me to discuss.
36xq87	-58459	1432339480	Minecraft	Why is Minecraft's PC community dying?	Sales for minecraft on the PC have been steady, about 1 million copies every 3 months, since it was released. However, since the sale to Microsoft and the death of bukkit, traffic on most minecraft communities, including this subreddit, has been down significantly. However, more importantly (at least to me), servers heavily relying on plugins, that express gaming experiences not found in any other game, are dying quickly. MCPVP is shutting down, and the only major Roleplay server left, Lord of the Craft, is down to around 60-110 active players at a time, down from well over 180 last year around this time. Every little roleplay server I've seen pop up for the past 6 months, I've also had to watch die.What's wrong? What can we do? Is it just that people don't care, or that the playerbase has gotten too young? I almost want to try to restart my old Roleplay server that I started years ago. Back then it didn't survive because of the abundance of other servers, now it probably wouldn't survive because there probably wouldn't be much of a playerbase older than 16, more of which would be inclined to apply for a roleplay server. Does no one else think that minecraft for pc is being disregarded to make way for the now more popular, and more profitable console versions? Isn't anyone else worried? Chances are, if I'm correct about some of these issues coming from minecrafts younger playerbase, this post will most likely not be read by anyone.Thanks for reading if you've made it this far, please share your thoughts below, whether in agreement, or disagreement to mine.

38wutq	-58459	1433688703	GlobalOffensive	What's up with MM?	So, I'm confused. Starting around this time last year, I got back into CSGO at the rank of SEM. In 6 months, I got up to nova 2, and down to SE over and over until January. I started actually practicing and started ranking up. I felt like I was actually improving after each game I played, and with no deranks inbetween, I got from Nova 1 to DMG in a period of a couple months. However through MG to DMG, the people I've been playing with are, well, weird. Like the other day, I played with 3 MG II's on my team, but they all played worse than any Novas I've seen (Not a single one had more than 10 kills, one sprayed at people no matter how far away they were, and another never stopped to shoot. That is stuff you do in silver, not MG). Another weird thing is, I've been playing okay in DMG. I generally get near to the top of the scoreboard, and I try to facilitate teamwork, but it still feels the same as the Nova ranks because its like no one really wants to work together. If one person says "Let's all go B", half the time, 2-3 people are going A. Also, I suck at spraying, my reaction time isn't great, but I'm still doing okay. I guess I thought DMG would be this place where people were really trying and wanted to win, and wanted to work together. A place where I'd really have to buckle down and get better to keep up with my teammates, not the same old sh*t as the nova ranks, where there's one guy wankin' his willy in spawn, another guy about an ocean over who can't stay connected to the game, and another who must be drunk or high cause he sucks so bad, and then ends up being the highest rank on the team. I guess I'm just disappointed. Sorry if this was way too rant-y.

So, a couple months ago to prepare for college I used the money I've saved up to build a new pc, and I went as 'all out' as I could. I have an i7-4790k, xfx r9 295x2, gigabyte z97mx gaming 5 mobo, and 16gb corsair vengeance pro 2400 mgz ram. I've had little issues here and there since I've build the comp, such as games not running as smoothly or as fast as they should, sudden shutdowns (which I assume may be due to overheating), and annoyingly, my gpu fan speed % never goes above 30-something%, which may be my issue. I think the performance issues may have a little bit with my ram being 2400mhz, and my board only supporting that in an overclocked mode (I'm pretty sure I don't have it set up correctly :S), however it doesn't account for my overheating issues, if that is the reason my pc is force shutting down. Any help will be greatly appreciated, if I forgot to include anything, please let me know. Thank you!
3ehp27	-58459	1437772379	RocketLeague	I love this game, but this is ruining it for me.	Okay so, it kind of ruins the entire idea of ranked matches, when 1/3 of the time I try one with a friend, I'm the only one that connects, and they don't. out of 6 matches, it happened twice, and I lost both 1v2s for the obvious reasons. This needs to be fixed asap, or at least nullify the resulting negative impact of a 1v2 to your ranking. Losing a 1v2 should not impact a player negatively, cause that's pretty much the only result that can occur.Edit: We only play on US East and West servers, so it's not related to the Euro servers being shotty.

During Old World Blues, I decided to drop Good Natured by using the Auto-Doc while keeping Skilled. I was expecting some of my skills to decrease and some others to increase, resulting in zero net change. Instead, majority of my skills greatly increased, resulting in 65 net increase. (+10 Energy Weapons, +10 Explosives, +10 Guns, +5 Lockpick, +10 Melee Weapons, +5 Sneak, +5 Survival, and +10 Unarmed)I was fascinated by this phenomenon and decided to experiment on it. When I decided to drop Skilled and keep Good Natured, my skills did not change, but I no longer had 10% exp penalty coming from Skilled. When I dropped both Good Natured and Skilled, there were some fluctuations in my skills like I did not take Good Natured at the beginning of the game, resulting in zero net change while losing 10% exp penalty.Is this some kind of a bug?

Here are the scenes I think I remember.-A hostile alien shoots out of a toilet and enters a poor guy's anus.-A couple of bullies try to force feed dog shit to this friendly alien. (This alien has weird human form.) I think the scene was in retrospect to one of the main characters who stop the bullies.-Main characters gain an ability shoot a wave from their fingers to find an object they wish to find. Or something like that.-The hostile alien eats one of the main characters after disguising as another main characters. Happens on a scooter.Movie 2I have no idea what this movie is about or is supposed to be. Some scenes I remember.-An middle-aged woman instructs a boy to draw a portrait of a girl. The boy shows the portrait to the girl afterwards. After a moment, the girl rewards him with a kiss at the water fountain nearby.-Some time lapse and the boy and the girl, now a young man and a woman, dances while the middle-aged woman, now an elderly, instructs them.Thank you very much in advance.
23hv7s	-58468	1397976421	learnpython	Need help using tkinter.	I just learned how to use tkinter and there is something not quite working. Here is the piece of code I am working with.    from Tkinter import *        tk1 = Tk()        row1 = Label(tk1, text = '# of rows')    row1.pack()    row2 = Entry(tk1)    row2.pack()        column1 = Label(tk1, text = '# of columns')    column1.pack()    column2 = Entry(tk1)    column2.pack()        def callback2(hue):        print hue        def callback1():        tk2 = Tk()        row3 = int(row2.get())        column3 = int(column2.get())        element = None        for i in range(0, row3):            frame = Frame(tk2)            frame.pack()            for i in range(0, column3):                element = Entry(frame)                element.pack(side = LEFT)        button2 = Button(tk2, text = "Enter", command = callback2('debug'))        button2.pack()        mainloop()        button1 = Button(tk1, text = "Enter", command = callback1)    button1.pack()        mainloop()If I run this code in Python 2.7.6, whenever I press button1, the function I bound to button2 will run, in this case printing 'debug.' Why is this happening? Also, this code includes my feeble attempt to create arbitrary number of entries. However, I have no idea how to get inputs out of them. Any insights?

What are some preferably solo pieces that are recognizable and instrumentally sound to play?Whenever my friends come over to my place, I perform some pieces for the lovely double-X-chromosomes, with apparent great enjoyment on their parts. I've seen greatest success in Por Una Cabeza, The Sleeping Beauty Waltz, and The Entertainer.I've tried some Disney and pop music pieces. While they are easily recognizable, they are too repetitive (gets boring very quickly), and not fun for me to play. Classical pieces are better but I don't get the desired responses when I play some obscure ones.Also, I would take any recommendations on good tangos and waltzes. I love to play them and I love watching the boobed ones dance along.I am hoping the gurus in the subreddit would help me expand my repertoire. For academic and research purposes, of course.
2ld5nn	-58468	1415194659	gaming	Looking for a particular game.	There was this flash game I played some years back, which cannot find anywhere anymore. I would like to play it again but I cannot remember the name of it.You take position on the left side of the screen where there are approximately 6 platforms you can build buildings on. Enemies will spawn on the right side of the screen and move toward left.You control only 1 building at a time. However some buildings work passively, while others have long cooldowns, so you don't switch back and forth with the control of the buildings. There are several buildings that just shoots where you click on the screen, given that the angle limitations of the building allows it, so you would control that building for the majority of the wave. There are more kinds of buildings than you can build so you need to be careful with the combination of the buildings for the maximum combat power.Each round of the game is comprised of multiple waves. You can only build and upgrade buildings between the waves. When the round is over, you move onto different location on the world map.Enemies are all some flying, steampunk themed creatures. They can attack and destroy buildings, but the buildings will regenerate at the end of the wave.I am hoping the gurus in r/gaming can identify the game for me.

2d3ils	-58475	1407618801	writing	Writing Rulez OK	I've noticed that every time someone mentions one of the rules of writing ('show don't tell,' or 'write what you know' or whatever), someone immediately pops up with a bunch of 'but what about so-and-so' and 'but I don't want to' and 'why should I stifle my creativity' arguments.  This tells me that a lot of people here don't understand what these rules are all about.  So here I am making a doubtless futile effort to try and explain it.  These things aren't laws of nature, okay?  The Writing Police aren't going to pull up outside your house, shoot your dog, smash your computer, and write you a ticket for syntax evasion if you decide to write your story in 2nd person future tense.  Like [the rules in other arts](http://www.photographymad.com/pages/view/10-top-photography-composition-rules) and [the pirate code](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325980/quotes) they're just *guidelines*.Whether it's writing, music, photography, or any other art, the rules are the distilled wisdom of the people who've done it before and found out what works.  They're the paved roads and signposts, and when you're first setting out on your artistic journey you would be well advised to follow them.  When you're still finding your way, they will help you put together art that fundamentally works.  It may or may not be great, or even good, but it'll *work*.Once you have some experience, once you understand how and why the rules work, then you can break them with a chance of still producing something that works.  The rules aren't there to constrain or stifle you; they're there to help you get to that point.  If you break the rules when you're ready, you can produce something really good, maybe great.  If you break the rules before you're ready, you just look bad.  Cormac McCarthy can leave out quotation marks and people think he's a genius.  You're not Cormac McCarthy.  If *you* leave off quotation marks people are going to think you simply don't know what you're doing and stop reading.The rules aren't straitjackets; they're trails, there to try and take you where you want to go.  Don't complain about them; understand why they're there, and try to outgrow them. I doubt this will help anyone, but perhaps one person will go, "Oh!" and it will be worthwhile.  In any case, I'm sure someone will have a splendid time shouting at me, and that's okay too.(Edit: typo.  Eight-year-olds will interrupt you....)

It doesn't. What matters is *appearing* to have your facts right.You can lose a reader by an egregious error, certainly, but you can also lose the reader by including an accurate fact that the reader believes to be wrong. So, even if this video proved that knights could swim in armor (rather than the opposite), you STILL couldn't have an armored knight swimming in your story because the reader wouldn't believe it.If you're going to include a fact that contradicts common myth--referring to Napoleon as tall, for example--you have to set it up very carefully or the reader will simply assume that you've made a mistake.You're better off including something wrong, but believable, rather than something correct, but unbelievable.

Now, it seems to have to drop your shape or text into the middle of the image, then click and drag several times to get it into the right place and size.Did Apple really fuck this up this badly, or is there some new way of doing it that I'm missing?Edit:  Downvotes will be interpreted as "Yes, they did fuck it up that badly, and I am angry at you for calling attention to it."Edit2: Found the 'Sketch' feature.  That's...interesting.  So, it looks like Apple didn't screw it up quite as badly as I thought, but they've still managed to make it worse.  Trying to draw shapes with a mouse or trackpad is a shitty experience.  Sketch would be a nice supplement to the old way of dropping in shapes, but it's no replacement.  
2n4c0a	-58475	1416698769	Guitar	Amp for beginning kid	My boy's turning 9 and wants an electric guitar.  He plays piano, so he knows music, but guitar is new to him.  I play a little (very, very little) acoustic, but don't know much about electrics.I'm looking at a Squier Mini Strat (he's tried several guitars and that's what's most comfortable for him) and thinking about the Fender Frontman 10G.  Budget's a little tight, but I could stretch to the Mustang I or Champion 20 if they're really that much better than the Frontman.  I like the Frontman for simplicity and cost, though.  The fewer controls the better, and he agrees.  He's been playing piano for 2 years, but I don't know if he's going to stick with guitar.So, is the Frontman really a 6" turd in a box, or should it be okay to get him started?Thanks.

33kd0j	-58475	1429767463	baseball	Little League WTF	I'm trying to make sense out of a play that my son's Little League coach insists on, but can't figure it out.  (No, I can't just ask him.  It's been a little tense since we declined to participate in the team prayer and a "WTF is that all about?" however politely worded, would not be welcome.)This is an 8-9 Minors team, moving up from 'coach pitch' (and skipping the intermediate 'modified kid pitch' level).  Coach does not want the pitcher covering first on a ball hit to the right of the first baseman.  He wants the first baseman to field the ball, while the second baseman runs past him to cover first and the pitcher stays on the mound.I just don't get why you would do that.  Not only is the 2nd baseman supposed to be backing up the first baseman on that play (or making the play himself -- that was my son's reaction: "Why not just catch the ball?"), but if he runs to first to cover he has to turn around to take the throw, whereas the pitcher is already facing that way.  It seems like just a bad play all around.  Barring something weird happening, my understanding is that the only time the 2nd baseman covers first is on a bunt that the 1st baseman has to field.  The only rationale I can think of is that in coach pitch getting the ball back to the pitcher, on the mound, would immediately stop all the runners.  So maybe he's clinging to that play.  Which means he's a moron, because that rule doesn't apply at this level.  Can anyone think of a good reason to have the 2nd baseman instead of the pitcher covering first?(The kids hate doing it, BTW.  They get confused in practice while the coaches yell at the 2nd baseman and pitcher, and then in the game the players ignore him and do it the conventional way, and he gets mad.)

After I got off the ride, I mentioned it to my Dad and sister who were there with me at the time. I said something along the lines of "I thought that was pretty cool that they put mirrors underneath the loops!", and they just kinda looked at me like I was crazy, and looking back at the ride, there were no mirrors, or anything. I was so firmly convinced that was what happened, but now looking back at it, I think I may have experienced a glitch.

When you open the spreadsheet you will notice that there is color coded rows, each assigned to a different type of clothing (For example, one is Camps, one is T-Shirts, etc.).

This is where you, /r/supremeclothing comes in. I think it would be best if we only allowed Gold "S"s, possibly mods, or just overall well-known members (shake-junt, etc.) to update the spreadsheet. That being said, if you would like to contribute and help out with the project, message me your email on Reddit and I will add you to the "Contributors" list on Google Docs, this will allow you to edit the file.If you are an editor of the file, here's some basic rules/how-to;1. Don't accidentally delete the whole thing, there's CTRL+Z if you accidentally do.2. If the 10 allotted spaces in each color are filled (which they eventually will be), simply click on the row, then go Insert, and "Row above", and remember to recolor the row you've inserted.3. Try to keep things in order, and by that I mean, keep the older releases at the top of the list, and the newer ones at the bottom.If you would like something to be added to the list, feel free to leave a comment or message someone in the list below.Contributors:* http://tinyurl.com/amatj2bIf there's anything I seem to have left out, or anything you would like changed, again, just leave a comment or message me.

(however, some legit camps don't either!)* Look at the stitching, does it look high quality, or does it look like a Chinese sweatshop? (http://i.imgur.com/NrP3e.jpg - How would anyone think that was real???)* Some camps have "Fat Patches" (patches that come out from the hat),  and some have them flat on the camp (stitched directly on). JUST BECAUSE THE PATCH COMES OUT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S FAKE.* Fat - http://holygrailgoods.com/3768-5333-large/supreme-giraffe-camp-cap.jpg* Flat- http://i1091.photobucket.com/albums/i383/thechocolateboy89/Spring%202012/IMG_5258.jpg* If the listing you're looking at has a picture such as this one; (http://i.imgur.com/lSYMn.jpg), it's fake.* Eyelets (holes on side) should be metal, and about 2 fingerwidths apart. There should be two eyelets on each side, excluding the Shadow Plaid camp which has 4 on each side, and the nylon Snakeskin which has 3. (Like brims, *some* eyelets aren't metal. However, most are. Check other listings of the same item or ask someone to see if the hat is supposed to have non-metal or not.)* ON SAFARI (leopard brim) CAMPS, THE BRIM IS A CORDUROY LIKE MATERIAL, NOT SOME FUZZY SHIT.* Always remember to check the tag. It's a dead giveaway of whether or not it's a fake.* Legit tag: http://i.imgur.com/Q2pTtsS.jpg* Fake tag: http://i.imgur.com/oZf4YXJ.jpg (c'mon, seriously?? its like you're not even trying)**BOX LOGO HOODIES:** * Eyelets should be metal; not slits, and not fabric.* The laces/drawstrings should be flat, not rounded.* The logo tab (not the big box logo on the front) should be on the side of the hoodie, not on the side of the front pouch.* Same with camps, make sure the stitching looks high quality, and the box logo patch isn't oddly italicized. (Should look *almost exactly* like this; http://i.imgur.com/vedLZgf.jpg)* Legit box logo hoodies have "Made in Canada" on the bottom of the tags. (Quite a few fakes have this too, but it's a good starting sign it's legit) * Again, make sure tags aren't oddly italicized. (Should look *almost exactly* like this; http://i.imgur.com/vSgmJrj.jpg)* More recent box logo hoodies have their serial numbers on the tags *upside-down.* Again, some fakes also have this, don't use it as your only criteria.**TEES:*** Tags should *almost exactly* look like this; (http://i.imgur.com/DXYVCnA.jpg)* On the bottom of the tag, there is almost always a small white watermark, capitalized, and *not* italicized. (some fakes have this, but again, it's a good starting sign you're looking at a legit piece.)* COLLAB AND BOX LOGO TEES ARE CONSTANTLY FAKED, only buy these from legitimate/well-known sellers, unless you're 10000000000% sure it's legit. And as always, check with other people for second and third inputs.wow gee thanks ill update this later, but this is good to start with yo. and sorry to flood your shit with these legit things, but i felt the need to create a good, complete one. props to jackowe, i stole some of his camp cap shit. leave comments for things to add to the list, or if im incorrect/inaccurate/vague about anything.-

1hnhqy	-58486	1372968479	Music	Guide to: Nujabes	Seba Jun, a legend in the music industry, although his name is unknown to many. Nujabes produces a very magical kind of music, and has garnered quite the cult following because of it. Adult Swim often used to play Nujabes beats during the little "bumps" between shows, so you might recognize some of his work from there. His music is a real experience, thought-provoking and relaxing, and nearly all of his fans would tell you the same. Nujabes released 3 studio albums, 4 singles, and worked extensively producing the Samurai Champloo soundtrack, along with Fat Jon, Minmi, and Force of Nature. His career tragically ended on February 26th, 2010, after a car accident in Shibuya, Tokyo, we'll get more in-depth about that later. But enough intro, let's get to the core of Nujabes, what you all came for.&gt;Metaphorical Music (2003)Metaphorical Music was Nujabes' first solo album, under the Hydeout Productions label. He achieved most of his recognition through this album, although he did have a small following beforehand, for his work in Hydeout's first compilation album. This album features many rappers/producers from the label, including Substantial, Pase Rock, and  Five Deez, among others. Metaphorical Music is a very good showcase of what Nujabes can do, as each track has it's own flavor, something that makes it unique. As with all of his music, the production is perfect, and the composition is master-class.**Album Highlights:*** [Lady Brown (Feat. Cise Starr)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5powxvY5YfE) - Probably places top 5 in my favorite tracks from Seba, a very romantic, warm track, and the vocals blend so perfectly with the smooth beats. * [Counting Stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O0kuoiAm2A) - Showcases his amazing ability to sample, while making it fluid enough to fit in with the beat that has already been established early in the song.* [Horn in the Middle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ciTMOIjnj0) - Complete with a John Coltrane interview playing in the background, this track shows how much old jazz/blues influenced Nujabes' music.&gt;Modal Soul (2005)Arguably the best album that Nujabes released, this album contains so many real classics that people associate with his legacy. Modal Soul really helped shoot him into the public-eye (among the instrumental hip-hop scene, at least), along with his aforementioned work on the Samurai Champloo soundtrack in 2004.  This album introduces and perfects the sound that Seba Jun is most well-known for, laid-back beats, catchy samples, and instruments of all varieties. Again, he brings along some vocalists/rappers from the Hydeout Productions label for the ride.**Album Highlights*** [Reflection Eternal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qU2MXeAz1E) - One of his most catchy songs, the basic drum beat, beautiful piano, and optimistic vocal samples all add up to song you'll often find yourself tapping your pen along to during your workday.* [Feather (Feat. Cise Starr &amp; Akin)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2wg2T16Xg) - The kind of track that you wish were longer, I could honestly listen to this song for hours on end.* [Luv(Sic) Part 3. (Feat. Shing02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyoYf7rZVGI) - A small piece of one of Nujabes' greatest works, which I'll talk about more later, all of his work with Shing02 is golden.&gt;Spiritual State (2011)I know what you're thinking; "2011? /u/Old_Book, I thought you said he died in 2010!", and you're correct, he did. Nujabes was in the process of completing this album upon his death. Spiritual State was finished posthumously by those close to him, using instrumentals Nujabes had already produced. This album has a generally more heavy feeling to it, a lot of the songs use deep, lush pads, and have a lower-than-average BPM. Many Nujabes fans agree that this was an immaculate send-off for his shortlived presence as a producer.**Album Highlights:*** [Spiritual State (feat. Uyama Hiroto)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0AvO0oBmUA) - A very relaxing track, it really takes you to another world. The piano is delightfully well played, and the backing percussion is mesmerizing.* [City Lights (feat. Pase Rock &amp; Substantial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lkcHrHdI-M) - The vocals and beat in this song remind me of something like a John Legend song, one of my favorites on the album.* [Color of Autumn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uZQtXNOESs) - I'm sure most people wouldn't place this as a real "highlight" of the album, but I think it deserves a spot on here, as it's a real throwback to the Jazz music that his music is so heavily influenced by.&gt;[**Luv(Sic) feat. Shing02 (2002-2013)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGfguhnvECc)As I said mentioned earlier, Nujabes and Shing02 were a real match-made-in-heaven so to speak. The entire Luv(Sic) series is a beautiful showcase of Nujabes' work throughout his life. From parts 1-6, Shing02 rhymes about all the different ordeals and pleasures that come along with love. Parts 1-5 were recorded during Nujabes' lifetime, and part 6 was completed by Shing02 and some of his other close friends after allegedly finding the instrumental he had produced for it on his cell phone just weeks after his death. Luv(Sic) isn't just music, it's a journey, and my absolute favorite piece of music in the world.&gt;Conclusion:So that's my quick introduction to Nujabes, for you. I hope I've helped you learn more about him, and hopefully led some of you to continue listening to all the rest of his music. If you enjoy this style of music, I highly recommend that you go buy/listen to the compilation album "Mellow Beats, Friends &amp; Lovers", which includes Nujabes among quite a few other really great artists. Sorry this isn't nearly as good as most of the other "guides", but I feel that a lot of his music speaks for itself, a story packed into every song.R.I.P - Seba Jun (February 7, 1974 – February 26, 2010)-

1nbkoi	-58486	1380389217	chillmusic	Guide to The Cinematic Orchestra	Hello, /u/old_book back again with another guide. My previous "Guide to Nujabes" was quite popular, and I greatly enjoyed writing it, so I figured I'd give it another go with a lesser-known group. I hope this is a good introduction to this wonderful band; Take your time reading, and stop and listen to the music as you see fit, it's very intricate and definitely understood best when in full focus. Without further adue, I present to you, the *Guide to The Cinematic Orchestra*. The Cinematic Orchestra, comprised of Jason Swinscoe, Phil France (double bass), Luke Flowers (drums), Tom Chant (saxophone), Nick Ramm (piano), and Stuart McCallum (guitar), debuted in 1999 under the *Ninja Tune* label, home also to Bonobo, Blockhead, and Eskmo, among others. Throughout the years they've been weaving a beautiful blend of jazz and electronic music, creating their own sub-genre different from any other artists. The group was primarily popularized by their 2012 hit single, [To Build a Home](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhHKfSFGdUI), which has been featured in numerous hit TV shows and movies, including *Suits, Grey's Anatomy, Criminal Minds, Friday Night Lights*, and many more. However, even their 1999 debut album, *Motion*, was a major success, allowing them to perform at the Director's Guild Awards ceremony that year, and even recompose the score of 1929's silent film, *Man with a Movie Camera*, for the "Porto European City of Culture Festival" in 2001. Later on, from the continued success of the group's 2002 album *Every Day*, they helped contribute to Radiohead tribute album, *Exit Music: Songs with Radio Heads*, alongside RJD2, among others. In 2008, they composed the score for the Disneynature film, *The Crimson Wing: Mystery of the Flamingos* in France.Enough of that boring history lesson though, let's get down to the guts of The Cinematic Orchestra, the most important part of any artist or group, the music itself.    -Motion (1999)-Lined heavily with jazz influences, this album is quite different from any of their following releases. *Motion* is a real journey, and will definitely keep your mind tuned in to the music; The album bounces up and down with different tempos, and will have fun, light drumlines, but also deep, lush tones, all wrapped up into one song.**Album Highlights:*** [Channel 1 Suite](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-a6c1b0qCs) - A very abstract track, the use of sampling is superbly done, not too much or too little. A personal favorite of the album.* [And Relax](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofki3wtF7UM) - As obviously implied by the song's title, *And Relax* is very downtempo and calming, the deep bass tones are beautiful and most certainly relaxing.* [Night of the Iguana](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pcxltHyBqQ) - A more lengthy track, but interesting every second of the way through it. Very intricate, you can definitely tell they put a lot of time into how every little instrument and sample sounded.Every Day (2002)-Definitely more electronic sounding than their previous album, however the jazz is still readily apparent in their music. *Every Day* is an extremely interesting album, and you can tell they tried getting a little more creative with it, every track sounds a little different than the last.**Album Highlights:*** [Flite](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhVifOBG16A) - Within the first few seconds you can tell it's a little different from the regular jazz intro. But don't worry, some light synth tones will glide you back into the recognizable drumline and piano. A very pleasing listen, upbeat and friendly.* [All Things to Men](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMKlE6A99Ug) - Another song of great length like *Night of the Iguana*, again with great intricacy. What sets this track aside from all others is the vocals, which are a pleasant surprise when you reach them a few minutes in.* [Oregon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wt1Dij0Lya8) - I don't think many would choose this song as a highlight, as there's much more interesting songs on the album, but I think *Oregon* is often overlooked because of it's simplicity, but it's simplicity is really what makes it so great.Ma Fleur (2007)-Their most recent album, Ma Fleur, contains many of their more popular songs, including the aforementioned *To Build a Home*. This is easily the most relaxing of all their albums, and contains few high-tempo songs. It's also considerably the furthest away from their jazz roots, featuring a wider array of instruments than their previous works.**Album Highlights:*** [Music Box](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSMNJuXK_3I) - Featuring a slowly plucked acoustic guitar and romanticized lyrics, *Music Box* is an extremely pretty song, and independent in style from the rest of the album.* [Into You](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WEijZMuQTg) - A really peaceful song, and again the lyricism is really spectacular. This track will really put you into another world with it's beauty.* [Breathe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmlhCC2VAXo) - With vocals from Fontella Bass, *Breathe* is one of the most soothing and magical songs I've ever heard. The composition is top-notch, and again- the vocals...Although I only covered their three studio albums, they have multiple other albums and singles that are just as good. From 1999 to present, The Cinematic Orchestra has been putting out immaculate music, and I sincerely hope they continue to do so into the far future. Their music is unlike any other, it's a real experience to listen to. Thank you all for reading, if I missed anything important, or if you have any feedback, please leave a comment! I would really appreciate it.

1p5hiw	-58486	1382651583	streetwear	My recent trip to PacSun	Little recon tale, just thought I'd share. Went to the mall, hit up Jimmy Jazz and bought some boots for Fall, went to Zumiez, etc.. On my way out, I passed by PacSun. Normally I would never go in there, but something caught my eye. #BEEN TRILL# display in the window. I had forgotten all about their movement to be put into retail stores. Quickly walked in and checked out their stuff. Tees were $67 (ridiculously overpriced, quality was just okay), and the crewnecks, which were a little thicker were $90 IIRC. Anyways, it was a good laugh and I go to turn around and walk out, when I see on the rack that they have the Digi-Floral (desert/blue) Janoskis. Wow, didn't expect to see those in stock. Pick up the shoe and go to the salesperson to ask if they actually had them in stock or if they were just up for display. They were, they had all sizes available.

For older/rarer items, just pay what you think is a fair price, because they don't go on the market often and no one has a solid price-point for them. If you insist on having some sort of ballpark number, 75% of the time you will be able to find someone selling the item on SuFu or Hypebeast.Price checks are honestly pointless, and they take up too much space on our front page.~~-~~Onto the new subreddit. As many people currently are, I'm mostly tired of seeing all these tiny **"[WTB] Canvas Camp"**, **"[WTS] Franklin Pullover"** type of posts. They almost always end up with 1 upvote 1 downvote, and 1 comment. This is not good, quality content. I don't want to see this on my front page. I propose that we create a new subreddit for buying, selling, and trading gear. Basically, this should all be like /r/sneakers. A dedicated subreddit just for discussion and to show off new gear, and also a dedicated subreddit to buy, sell, and trade./rant

1an3j8	-58489	1363749777	mindcrack	[Suggestion] Link to the Mindcracker's series	Recently there have been many new series added by various mindcrackers. I saw BTC's video that taked about his new series that he is starting up. I thought that it would be a good idea for this subreddit to have a link to all the series that are being played through right now by the various mindcrackers. I am imagining a page where each mindcracker is listed with their series below. Those could be devided by current and past/finished. I though this would be helpful because there are so many different series and so many mindcrackers that even with seeing just the uploaded videos in youtube you can still miss some. I find that some of the video title just mesh together. I see this as more of finding new series to watch instead of going to it to find the latest videos. I do know all the videos are linked to on the subreddit but I sometiems miss them on here also.There are also just some random videos that some of them upload. I don't have a good answer of where to place those but someone else might.  I may be missing this somewhere on the subreddit or there may be a similar thing already in action but I though I would throw the idea out there.Also I appologise for grammar or spelling mistakes, I plan to be an engineer not a english major.

Went in to work today, obviously not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Though I normally feel alive and cheery at my job, today I was a bit gloomy. Everything seemed strange. Sort of like I was in a dream. I didn't think much if it,and went ahead to this training session we had. As we took our places round the boardroom table, someone passed the attendance sheet around. It got round to me, signed it, passed it on. The sheet completed its round, went through the people who had signed it earlier, they signed again, and was handed to me. Weird, I thought , and as in looked at the paper, my name had a blank space next to it. Apparently I was the last one to sign it. Any explanations? I'm not prone to hallucinations, never had such a history, and this was the first time something like this has happened.

2sqfzs	-58493	1421504542	swoleacceptance	I come to you with a heavy heart and a ripped seam	Bros, yesterday a great gift from Odin arrived in the mail. It was a Harrington jacket, similar to the one worn by Broniel Craig in Quantum of Swolace, that I had ordered online.Slightly on the expensive side, it caused a financial deload on my wallet. Nonetheless I was excited as I would need something to protect my gains from the light summer breeze few months down the line.However, as I put it on, the heavens tore open and Thors hammer did strike the anvil. I looked down in horror to gaze upon a sleeve completely ripped out. Now I must either return this to the oppressive swole haters and hope they give me back my wallet gains, or take it to the tailors and shamefully explain the situation and request that they mend it and reinforce both sleeves to prevent future embarrassment. Pray for me brethren, squats, deads, and rows. And please take care of your sleeves. Mine is a pain I wish not upon any followers of the Iron.

Tonight as I walked out on a tinder date (she was a swoleoppressor with strong disdain for the ones on the iron path), I walked home under the influence of Odin's ale.It was the middle of nightfall. And the moon shone brightly when I encountered 2 street dogs. They seemed friendly but deprived of nutrition. As I pet them so they may understand the loneliness of the heavy lifter, they took a liking to me. They followed me a short distance to mine residence, and wouldn't leave my side. I thought they were expecting food, but there wasn't a gains vendor open at this ungodly hour.  I went in, and reached into my own breakfast funds, and provided these furry brethren with eggs and milk. I may not have breakfast materials tomorrow, but I hope these dogs have gained in my sacrifice.May Odin forgive my lack of food intake as he blesses helps these animals onto the path of iron. I seek your support in this testing time.

29xlll	-58499	1404605214	dogecoin	Suggestion regarding The Sprint Vote	Hi fellow shibes!I think that the majority of us will agree that making a success with that vote will be extremely beneficial for the community. Especially when it comes "for free" (10 seconds a day during the morning/afternoon coffee/tee). However I am not sure that daily avalanche of "Lets do this" post will be the best way to go. It possibly will irritate huge number of shibes that otherwise might be supportive. So I propose (also **TL:DR**): Only one person/mod posts daily reminder with the link for the vote and the info regarding the vote. That way the front page will stay clean and we will avoid needless spam posts (even thought with good intentions).

xc2f1	-58500	1343547457	pokemon	Anyone have a Rooted Android Phone?	I'm really bad at formatting posts, so excuse the... everything.Ever since I sold my copy of Soul Silver, I found myself staring at my Pokewalker, wondering what I should do with the Geodude that found it's way onto it.  Thinking about the eternal prison that this Geodude trapped itself in not only depressed me, but made me wonder... can my phone be a Pokewalker?Now I don't want to retype everything from the readme I wrote, so I'll just quote it.&gt;# What is Project PA?&gt;&gt;Project PA is the love child of A Pokewalker, and Chao Adventure (http://sonic.wikia.com/wiki/Chao_Adventure).&gt;Don't feel like reading that?  Imagine a Pokewalker, but more Tamagachi in that your Pokemon grow through&gt;interaction instead of just shaking it, or attaching it to some oscilating object (everyone does it, it's ok).&gt;&gt;# Why am I doing this?&gt;&gt;I wanted a Pokewalker for fifth-gen games (which coincidentally, are the only ones this works on).&gt;&gt;# How am I donig this?&gt;&gt;Emulating the GTS.&gt;&gt;# What does it do right now?&gt;&gt;It'll let you go into the GTS, and deposit a Pokemon.  It then saves those bytes to the SD Card in a folder named Gneiss.&gt;&gt;# Why should I care about any of this.&gt;&gt;No particular reason.  None at all.&gt;&gt;# This README was so well written, I find myself caring all of a sudden.  How can I help?&gt;&gt;Just catch a bunch of Pokemon, load up Project PA on your ROOTED Android device, connect to Project PA&gt;with your DS, and send the Pokemon through the GTS.  After you've done this enough times to stop caring, just zip (or preferrably 7zip)&gt;up all of the files saved, and send them in an email to gneiss@blacktome.net&gt;&gt;# Why would I want to do any of that?&gt;&gt;So I have a wider variety of pokemon to test with.  Why don't I do it alone?  I was for a bit with a Zangoose of mine, but then&gt;when I tried working with my Audino, everything went to hell.  I figured the more samples I have, the better.&gt;&gt;# Why should I catch all those Pokemon?  You can do that yourself!&gt;&gt;Well, I can, but that's a lot of work.  And work sucks.  And also, since Android is so wonderiously spread out, there are a lot of different&gt;devices, roms, configurations, and a million other variables that could make something go wrong.  I figured the more people testing,&gt;the easier it is to go and fix them now, before something more serious shows up.&gt;&gt;################################################################ TL ; DR ###################################################################&gt;&gt;# Ok, so I read through all of this, and I'm still interested (for some reason), but I still don't know exactly what to do. &gt;&gt;1.)  Install the APK in this archive to your ROOTED Android device.  If you don't know how to do this, make sure your device is set to&gt;	allow non-market application installs (refer to this http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/41082/install-non-market-apps-on-your-android-device/).&gt;	After that, stick the apk on to your phone's SD card, and install it using your favorite file manager.&gt;&gt;2.)  Make sure your DS and Android device are on the same Wifi network.  Most carriers block incoming traffic to Android phones, so it's not&gt;	going to work on 3G or 4G.&gt;	&gt;3.)  Run Project PA&gt;&gt;4.)  Change your DS' DNS settings to use the IP address that is printed out by Project PA.  Need instructions?&gt;	http://www.rockmyspace.info/image-upload/uploads/1/dsdsada.png&gt;&gt;5.)  Catch a bunch of Pokemon.  Doesn't really matter which.&gt;&gt;6.)  Go to the GTS, and deposit them.  It's set to reject all Pokemon you send to it, so you might want to release them afterwards, but yeah.&gt;	Just dump them into the GTS.&gt;	&gt;7.)  The PPA app will spit out a bunch of text, all preceeding with Gneiss or Obsidian.  Ignore them.&gt;&gt;8.)  If something goes wrong, PPA will automatically send a crash report to me, but any extra information always helps.&gt;&gt;9.)  After you're done doing all that stuff, get access to your SD card on your PC (connect it, put the SD card in your phone, however you nomally&gt;	do it.  Make a zip (preferrably 7zip) of the Gneiss folder that magically appeared, and send it to gneiss@blacktome.net&gt;	&gt;10.)  Feel good about helping someone out.&gt;&gt;11.)  ????&gt;&gt;12.)  Profit**For the love of flying pasta, when you're done using the app, press the menu button, and hit safe exit.**TL;DR TL;DR?Install the APK, change dns settings, send Pokemon to gts.[Here's the download link](http://nintendowifi.blacktome.net/ppa/ppa.7z)[Here's a link straight to the APK if you're browsing from an Android device](http://nintendowifi.blacktome.net/ppa/Project%20PA.apk)[And a screenshot, if anyone cares about those](http://nintendowifi.blacktome.net/ppa/Screenshot%2001.png)[Another one, showing what it looks like when working properly](http://nintendowifi.blacktome.net/ppa/Screenshot%2002.png)[And the last, showing how to safely exit the application](http://nintendowifi.blacktome.net/ppa/Screenshot%2003.png)

25bnhz	-58500	1399857750	TestPackPleaseIgnore	Lockup issues	Hey guys, I'm not sure if I should be posting here, or on the github page, but I've been having some trouble with TPPI eating up resources, and locking up.Whenever I start the game, I immediately have 50~60% cpu usage, and 1.5~2 gigs of memory being used up while I'm in the menu, all before I even load up the game.  Disk usage is high during loading (of course), but it sinks back down since I'm playing a server being run on another computer of mine.When I'm actually in game, I can play comfortably at 150 fps (render distance normal, fast graphics, advanced opengl, and some graphics card settings), with some slight stutters, but I gave up on fixing that ages ago.  I can play like this for around 10 to 15 minutes.  After that, the game randomly locks up, and I have to end the java process in task manager.Oh, and nothing in the logs seems to stick out.Does anyone know what's going on, or what I can do?Here's my specs for reference&gt; i5 4670&gt; MSI GTX 760 TF&gt; 4GB G.Skill Ripjaws (It would be 8, but I broke the other stick :c)

I understand that proxmox is using this for DNS names for controllers, but I'd really like to have that for my regular VMs at least. I really don't see why there isn't an option to have a separate DNS name, and display name for hosts.&amp;nbsp;Anyway, thanks

If I went for a run in the morning or if I had football practice. My ankles and knees would be incredibly sore to the point that it was very difficult to sleep. So I would load up a bowl and toke before bed to get both relief and to help me sleep through the night.

2dkp7k	-58508	1408049338	seduction	[FR] Approached a girl at the bar that I knew had a crush on me from school. Number closed but I'm having trouble.	Alright, so our night begins with me arriving at the bar at about 12:30 due to my friends having poor planning and me having to drive people around but that's not important. My friend (who is a natural and is the one usually pushing me to approach) is there with a girl he has been seeing and her friend and the two girls are bombed already. We are talking and greeting each other and decide to move towards the bar to get some drinks when I see the girl I know from school. I remember the 3 second rule of first spotting a girl and immediately walk up and introduce myself to her and the girl she is sitting with. Conversation consists of usual small talk, she comments on how I've gotten a lot bigger in terms of muscle mass and is touching my arms and abs which is giving me huge green lights in my head. Ask if she wants to go dance and she agrees but her friend decides that they need to go find their other friend real quick so she tells me she will be right back. Sit there for 5 mins which gives me a chance to finish my beer but now I'm wondering exactly how long she's going to be. I kinda had a peek around the corner of the wall in the direction she went and I saw her sitting down talking to another guy. Turn back around and wait patiently for her to walk back around. Once she does, I announce we're going to the dance floor and stick out my hand and she grabs it and is tightly squeezing my arm the whole way.We work our way to a somewhat open spot on the dance floor and start grooving but I failed to see that her friend that took her away in the first place has followed us. My friend the natural also came up and he took over her friend for me and was trying to loosen her up and get her to dance which she kinda did but was pretty reluctant. There was a lot of playful teasing going around between all of us and we were having a good time. Then her friend announces AGAIN that they need to go find so and so and grabs my girl and starts to walk. I'm thinking that this bitch is cockblocking so hard and decide to run behind and grab the girl and get her number before I don't see her for the rest of the night. About an half hour or an hour goes by and I'm just chilling with my friends having a good time and we decide to go back onto the dance floor for some more fun. Once we get up there, she's with another guy who's different than the once she was talking to before and they are kinda half dancing. He looks really reluctant to let loose and fully dance and she is kinda doing exaggerated stupid dance moves to make fun of him. We were on the other side of the floor and I was just kind of observing. My friend tells me to let him handle it and he calls her over and starts talking to her, while I'm just kinda standing there not knowing what's going on. Apparently he was jazzing me up and saying how good of a guy I was but I can't quite remember cause at that point I was drunk. Anyways I think we hugged and went our separate ways and made our way outside. Once we got outside she was talking to the same dude that was on the dance floor and I was just talking to my friends as they had a smoke. My friend starts talking to her again and they talk for a solid 10 mins while I'm talking to my other friend. He then calls me over and just says "talk to her, man" and makes it super awkward. She starts telling me how she has always had a crush on me and I tell her the same but I wasn't sure what to do in that moment and just kinda walk away (again, at this point I was drunk/pretty drunk and I'm not sure exactly what happened and also this was last friday) but my friends tells me she was ready to suck my dick/fuck me that night. In my mind that really wasn't something that could have been done cause her and her cockblock friend were both cabbing back to her place.Over all this was a huge step for me because I usually have crushing approach anxiety but I decided fuck it this time and things went really well for the first bit. I also don't know when I could have been a lot more forward and sexual where I might have been able to hook up with her. My plan was to get her dancing and get really touchy while doing that and go for the k close but everything kinda got fucked up. Any help is appreciated and I will also be writing up a FR from the following night. Thanks guys!

2mphc4	-58518	1416348150	networking	MTU Fragmentation	Got an issue at work we are trying to overcome concerning MTU limitations in certain areas. We need to supply 4000 MTU links at all locations, but some are in very remote areas that have infrastructure that only supports 1500 (default). This would mean that the local provider would begin fragmenting the packets once it leaves our router, which is out side of the spec. The requirement is to provide a 4000 MTU from end to end to the customer, any fragmentation must be transparent to them.   Simple Drawing would be: 4000-&gt;1500-&gt;4000We have overcome this issue with Cisco's Virtual Fragmentation and Reassembly (VFR), but this puts a lot of stress on the router equipment and also has issues with buffering and latency. Once utilizing VFR, the specs on the device are reduced, as their CPU and NIC become maxed. Equipment cost also becomes an issue with this solution. Has anyone heard of another way to solve this problem?Side Note: I know this sounds ridiculous, but the customer is always right of course.

Currently our BGP routes are only using timers that tell me the last time it learned the specific route. But my customer is sending us logs that show every flap. Our current setup will only notify me when the next hop BGP neighbor drops. I cleared one issue with finding that the router lost power, but what about tracking flapping routes beyond that? Is there a way to track certain routes (since the table is pretty large as it is)? 
3iqg92	-58518	1440774570	Fantasy_Football	Kelvin Benjamin Issue	So I just took over a team in my buddy's dynasty league. The guy before me did not even finish with a full roster, so I have one hell of an up hill battle.My biggest issue right now is that Kelvin Benjamin just tore an ACL and is out all season. We have an IR spot, but to keep him there would cost me a fifth round pick this year. This also means he would cost me a fourth rounder for next season, which will be the last season he is available as a keeper in this league.As the new guy taking over a shitty roster, I do not have many keepers like the rest of the league (lots of people already accounted for). Do I spend a 5th round pick on him just to keep him for next season?Thoughts????

Out of four orders, only one has come complete with undamaged and appropriately labeled items. When I tried to return a jacket with a ripped sleeve liner, I was just refunded and never sent a replacement. This all being said, I'll continue to shop from them, given that I don't have access to a store nearby to me, but I hope the constancy of the orders will start to become a bit more reliable. Has anyone else had a similar experience, or have I just been unlucky?

I found [January 2014](https://law.ku.edu/sites/law.ku.edu/files/docs/resources/new-york-bar-exam-conduct-guidelines.pdf) and it outright permits it. Anyone know exactly whether we can bring the items mentioned above? Has anyone called the examiners board and asked?                If we are not allowed to bring these things, anyone got some ideas of how to get to exam location with a wallet, at least? How do you go to lunch without money or a credit card?

This will be the first W:tA game I have run and the first WoD game I have run. Any tips for a newby ST involving the system and just general advice?I have a few main ideas for how the run will go so far. Starting with the Rite of Passage the players will be tasked to bring back a Garou who has secluded himself from his Sept and is beginning to secumb to Harano. The players will be tasked with bringing him back so that the Sept might try and help him through his time of need. At the same time I will be having two other groups trying to capture the Garou. A wyrm agent, probably Pentax and DNA. Past that I had an idea of eventually sending the players back in time to interact or play as their ancestors as part of a prophecy. Still lots to fill in but I think I should be able to start within a week or two.

He kills the tyrant on top of me and ends up going down to the goliath on top of the Tyrant. We are down to my buddy who is playing Laz. He cloaks and comes in to try and revive the assault. Here is where the magic happens. I am watching his screen and I see his character walk up the the Tyrant, he reaches out and appears to pet the Tyrant on the nose (We are underneath the Tyrant if you remember). As soon as his glove goes off the Tyrant latches onto my buddy and starts thrashing him around, killing him. The whole time my buddy is screaming about how the game should prioritze players over creatures. The goliath wasn't even around at that point and we lost. Best. Loss.

This is when I found out that my computer, or more precisely windows 8.1, isn't recognizing anything except my main display. The baffling this is that both the second monitor I am testing and the rift show the Bios screen and the Windows loading screen fine. Once it transitions to the windows login screen there is a brief moment of darkness on all connected devices then only the main monitor comes back on line to the login screen. I have been working with it for the majority of the day and all the "fixes" for similiar issues I have found haven't worked so far. I am coming to you guys first before I do a full wipe of my computer as I can't think of anything else to fix the situation.

2q8hsz	-58585	1419385887	tabletopgamedesign	[FIRST POST] [WIP] Phantasmagoria of Danmaku Duel (Touhou inspired card game)	This is my first post ever on reddit. Please, excuse me is this post is not adequate enough, but I'm not familiar with the rules of this subforum yet. The fact is that I've been working on a personal project trying to splice together a card game based on the touhou series and I need some feedback from the comunity. For the ones that are not familiar with it, the Touhou Project is a saga of 2D vertically-scrolling shooting games made by one man team called Shanghai Alice, or also known as ZUN. Its most important features are the staggering number of characters and the music created by ZUN himself.*Phantasmagoria of Danmaku Duel* is expected to be a fast paced dueling card game between two players that take the role of one of the main heroines of the saga, trying to defeat the other player trough a danmaku duel, as the same name implies. Players will initially be able to choose between Reimu Hakurei, Marisa Kirisame and Sakuya Izayoi. Other characters might be added later, such as Youmu Konpaku or Sanae Kochiya. This game draws inspiration from another fan-made card game called *Rumble Spell Orchestra* in some of its mechanics.**GOALS**There are three main goals in this game. A player wight win the game if he: * Reduces the hit points of the opponent's character to 0. * Prevents the other player from drawing cards by depleting his deck. * Has 20 or more victory points.**SETUP**Each player has a deck of 40 cards in addition of a shared deck of 10 Fairy cards. A player's deck can only contain three copies of a single card belonging to the same character. The Fairy deck is an exception because it will contain a fixed amount of cards in every game. The Fairy deck it's composed by four copies of one point cards, three copies of two point cards, two copies of three point cards, and a single copy of a four point card.Discarded cards are placed in a player's discard pile. This is particularly important because players need to discards cards as a mean to pay for other cards and its effects.Each player starts the game by drawing a hand of five cards. At the end of the turn, if a player has fewer than five cards in his hand, then proceeds to draw cards until he has exactly five cards. If a player would draw a card while his hand is empty, that player shuffles his discard pile back into the main deck. Reshuffling might seem to make losing the game by card draw impossible, soon you will see that is not the case.**PLAYING THE GAME**During a player's turn, that player may play **Wave** cards as a way to undermine the opponent's strategy. To do so, players need to reveal their hands and discard cards to match or exceed the Bullet value of the card they want to play. The **Wave** card played this way is put in the opponent's discard pile. As the opponent shuffles his or her deck, there will be more chances for the **Wave** card to appear in his or her hand and force the player to confront it when revealing them. To overcome a **Wave** card, a player will have to roll dice equal to the EV (Evasion value) of their character. Wave cards have a value called HV (Hit value) that determines the number of cards that will be removed from the deck if it hits. For each successful EV roll, the players cancel one point of HV from the Wave card, making it less provable to hit the character. A roll will be considered successful if the result is 4 or more. If the roll results into a 6, the character is considered to gain *graze* from the wave and its controller gains the same amount of victory points. Once confronted, **Wave** cards are put in the discard pile of its owner.Players may play up to one **Spell** card face down each turn. Players can activate it by paying its *Charge* cost, although players can only have on activated Spell card at a time. Even if they have an activated **Spell** card, players can still play additional **Spell** cards by putting them under the first one. At the beginning of each turn, except the first one, players will gain one *Charge* point. Players may also tap their characters by *focusing* them to gain one additional *Charge* point. Just like character cards, **Spell** cards have hit points. If a character ever loses all her hit points then her owner will lose the game. On the other hand, if a **Spell** card loses all its hit points then will be taken by the opponent along with all **Wave** cards put in front of it as *Victory* points. As long as a player has an active **Spell** card, the opponent will not be able to attack his or her character unless the opponent *breaks* the **Spell** card before. Players may play **Wave** cards in front of their active **Spell** card as a defense because if it’s attacked the opponent will have to overcome them before.Attacking is the way to reduce hit points from characters and **Spell** cards. To attack, a character needs to have *Power* points. Players can acquire *Power* points by destroying **Fairy** cards which can be found in the deck shared by both players. To do so, players need to play **Wave** cards with a HV (Hit value) that surpasses the HV indicated in the **Fairy** card. Each time a **Fairy** card is discarded, the Fairy deck must be shuffled and then reveal an additional **Fairy** card, forcing players to face an increasing number of **Fairy** cards to acquire *Power* points.The attacking player will roll a number of dice equal to the AV (Attack value) of his or her character, while the defending player will roll a number of dice equal to the EV (Evasion value) of his or her character. Each success of the defending player will cancel one of the rolls of the attacking player, making it less likely to strike. On the other hand, if the attacking player does succeed at least in one roll, it will deal damage equal to the number of **Power** Points of his or her character. Take in mind that if a character is hit with a **Wave**, she will lose all her accumulated **Power** Points instead of removing cards from the deck.It's possible that a player has placed a number of **Wave** cards in front of his or her active **Spell** card with a total *Bullet* value equal or surpassing the *Time* requirement of that **Spell** card. If that happens, is considered that its owner wins that **Spell** card by *time out* and takes it and all **Wave** cards in front of it as *Victory* points.The game ends when one of the three main goals are achieved.P.S. I will be thankful if someone, anyone, is willing to give me his or her feedback to improve this project.P.S.S. English is not my mother tongue so, please, forgive any errors you might encounter in this post.

2xqtbs	-58585	1425351352	tabletopgamedesign	Feedback needed for a rogue-like inspired dungeon crawler	Hello everybody!For the last year or so I've been dumping my spare time in a project and I think I need some feedback from you to decide if the game is ready to prototype or I should work some more with it.#MECHANICSOne of the main rules while developing this game has been to be as close to the rogue-like genre as possible:- The dungeon will be revealed to the players as they explore it.- The players will find objects on the floor or loot them from monsters.- These objects can be picked up with out any ability check.- Objects will be placed in a player inventory.- Most objects will need to be identified to be properly used.- To identify an object, the player has to trigger its reveal condition.- Objects have weight that encumbers the player and makes more difficult to move silently and cast spells.- Monsters will hear the player when he moves, attacks or sings, if he is a bard.- Monsters will become aware of the player's position and move towards him.In addition to all this mechanics, I've tried to add some deck building aspects to the game. This has proofed to be more difficult than expected as it will be explained later. One may think that having to cycle through a deck to find an object the player already possesses makes no sense, but I think that deck building elements  can be implemented in this context if what the player draws is not the object itself but the chance to use it. For example, a character might know a spell but in some circumstances he will not be able to play it. The same is true when he casts that spell. The character don't forgets how to cast it, he only loses the chance to do so. I hope it all becomes clear.This deck building mechanics comprise:- Each player has a initiative deck with 12 basic action cards.- Each initiative deck is formed by the same type of cards but in any quantity that the player chooses. For example, a player might have a deck with five blue action cards, four red action cards and three green action cards. While the other player has four of each type.- Players also have a dungeon deck of 60 o 80 cards that will be used to form the dungeon and contains both objects and threats.- Players draw cards from their initiative decks each turn to form their hands.- Once their initiative deck is depleted, they shuffle their discard pile again into their initiative deck.Having said that objects are placed in an inventory and what players draw is the chance to use objects, now the only thing left is how players acquire action cards. This aspect is solved by introducing what I believe to be a drafting mechanic:- When a player equips an object card, he will draw the appropriate amount of cards from his sideboard.- If an object is discarded or unequipped, the player will have to remove the according action cards from his deck, then shuffle it.- Each player has to build their sideboard at the same time as their dungeon deck.- Players can only perform an action if they have the correct action card.- Some objects, like potions, will have action cards that will be always available to the player.- Simple actions, like moving, will not require a specific action card.- To move, a player will have to use two cards from their hands to move one space. This means that with a hand of six cards, the player will be able to move three spaces but without performing any other action this turn.This mechanics are more or less the base of the game. I hope you have some suggestions to do, even if you dislike them or not.Cheers!

Since I was a kid I wanted to train to be strong and athletic. Even when I was suffering depression my only desire was to feel better as soon as possible to be able to go to the gym again. But recently things change for the worse. I've been diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, possibly the lowest level. It wasn't entirely a surprise because my mother also suffers CFS and fibromyalgia, but I wanted to think that my tiredness and apathy was caused by the depression and not by something worse. I any case, sorry for explaining my life. But the problem is that doctors think that the only type of exercise that I should do is walk for 30 minutes each day. I'm still young and relatively healthy, I resist to think that my limit is the same as and old man. What do you think I should do? I know that now I shouldn't overexert myself, but think that perhaps doctors are being too cautious about it.Sorry if this doesn't belong here, but I'm really interested to know is someone here is suffering the same.

34rx8d	-58585	1430701952	tabletopgamedesign	Stuck trying to convey the feeling of a rogue-like into a card game.	HEAVILY ABRIDGED***When developing what has become my main project I tried to add some mechanics from rogue-like games forcing me to decide which approach to take when adapting the grid system most of this games use.I'm actually torn between a faithful or an accessible representation. By being faithful I mean printing a grid on the back side of the cards and use them to place dice that represent walls and enemies. But I think the game will be more accessible if the player only uses cards to represent whole rooms inside the dungeon.[DICE](http://i.imgur.com/QnRXUO1.png)[CARDS](http://i.imgur.com/rUd3ojj.png)This images don't represent an actual game situation. They only serve to show the most problematic aspects of this design, by that I mean that the players need to be constrained in their movements by placing walls and how this walls will be placed, on a grid or between rooms.In my game, when a player moves into an unexplored room, the opponent takes the first card from his or her darkness deck and puts it face down to represent the recently explored room. The darkness deck contains all the threats that the opponent can use to prevent the player from winning. When a player explores new rooms, the darkness is dispelled and the opponent’s influence on the player is reduced.My question is which versions do you think is more feasible.
37b76p	-58585	1432634427	tabletopgamedesign	Adding and removing cards from a deck. How annoying is this mechanic?	Lately I've been trying to add some new mechanics to my main project that involve adding and removing cards from a small deck of cards, but I'm still unsure if players will find this mechanics annoying to deal with. That's why I need your opinion.To give you some context, let's say that in this project each player  starts the game with a deck called 'initiative deck' composed by 12 basic action cards. Players will draw each turn from their deck. This represents the amount of actions the player can take during his turn.Players will add action cards to the initiative deck each time they equip a new weapon or other type of object. These action cards represent the chance the player has to attack or use those objects when drawing cards from the initiative deck. Consequently, if those objects are somehow discarded or unequipped, the player will have to remove the appropriate action cards from his initiative deck, forcing him to search in the deck.[WEAPON CARD EXAMPLE](http://i.imgur.com/IQ1vMwm.png)For each point of damage the player receives, he will be forced to remove a basic action card from his initiative deck and put them aside to represent the amount of damage he has accumulated. This mechanic represents how the player is being incapacitated by his wounds, limiting the amount of actions he can take. The player will be forced to search in his initiative deck each time he receives damage, and I'm sure that this will happen far more often than the previous example.I've been thinking and, even if it's thematically justified, it's not necessary to remove cards to represent the damage taken by the player, some ordinary counters will work in this situation. The first example is far more problematic because I've build the entire resource system of the game around action cards and having objects that add new cards to the deck.What do you think? Will the players be discouraged to play if they have to search into their deck too much?
387vdi	-58585	1433253813	boardgames	Is there a game like this?	Sorry if this question sounds silly, but I'm looking for a game mechanically similar to most deck building games, that is a game where players acquire new cards for their decks from an available pool of cards, but with a twist.What I mean is if there is game where these pools are not immediately available to the player but instead arranged as a "map" that the player has to explore to gain access to them. This mechanic forces the player to move through the map to acquire different types of cards and adds a layer of territorial control to the game.Is there a game like this?
3g60eq	-58585	1438977241	tabletopgamedesign	Some help needed finding a mechanic.	Hello everybody. I need your help again. I'm required to create an historical game as a college project and I'm struggling with some concepts.To give some context, this game is centered on the territorial struggle between the Byzantine and the Ottoman Empire and the part that took Roger von Blume and his mercenaries.This game is not thought to be collaborative. Each side starts trying to join forces to defeat a bigger threat, but just one player can win. Soon enough one player will be forced to betray the other to steal the win. This divides the game in two different phases. During the first phase, each player has a secondary objective to achieve in order to win the game. For example, the mercenaries have to completely influence the Byzantine court, while the Byzantine player has to make her cities prosper. On the other hand, during the second phase, now that the major threat has been almost extinguished, each player has to fight the other in an open war.In order to differentiate both sides, each one will use a different game mechanic, making this game mostly asymmetrical.  The mercenaries will use mechanics from deck building games, while the Byzantine player has to build piles of cards in her cities. The gist of the game is that the mercenaries, foreign people in a foreign land, have limited resources and have to pillage the cities build by the Byzantine player to progress, forcing the players to find the balance between the aggression and the cooperation during the first phase.The problem comes when I try to define the mechanics of the Byzantine player because I have no reference. I know no game where your objective is to build piles of cards. Do you know of any game with this mechanic? What do you think a game like this has to contain in terms of game mechanics?Thank you in advance.

3f3y3b	-58595	1438222103	Austin	Startup Village	Hello I have been toying with the idea that a house I have for lease, to be put up as a Startup Village. There are 4 bedrooms, kitchen, dining, living, back patio, back yard, one car garage with electrical car charging station. I am willing to make the house available for techies who work on web apps and phone apps, stock the fridge, provide a car, and fully furnish it and arrange for regular cleaners, arrange for cooking food etc. In exchange, partly they would develop apps for me or help me create revenue. Does this appeal to anyone. The location is walkable distance to HEB, to coffee shops bus stop, and train stop. Any one has any idea about how the house can be put to use. It is by Spicewood Springs &amp; 183. All suggestions and comments appreciated. If anyone is wondering, this is the place. http://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/8000-Parliament-Pl_Austin_TX_78759_M75225-57939I was also thinking to convert the place to a co-op.

Tired of all this forum gossip, could someone provide a definitive link that shows Google has halted and suspended the roll out of the OTA. Or alternatively if you've received the OTA in the past 2 days, this would show that they haven't halted the update. ThanksUpdate: found  n4 and n10 users who have received their OTAs in the past few days (including today). So at least we know that there's not been a blanket halting of the update.

Also, has anyone flashed it, did it solve your 5.0 woes?Update: 5.0.1 is live, OTAs are out and it's available to those who haven't got 5.0 yet too

(2013 edition) ~~When I say "OK google", it now takes 3 or 4 seconds to respond whereas before on Kitkat it was almost instantaneous.~~Moreover, when I say "OK Google" when the screen is off, I can hear the tablet respond but the screen doesn't switch on. I've also found that when I click on the 3 dotted icons on the google now screen, this makes the text get cut off by the options that pop up, and sometimes when I try to edit the icons on that screen the ui glitches.  Anybody else experiencing these delays or glitches? Overall, I think the upgrade is worth it. update: The response time when I say "OK Google" has sped up massively since an update on the Google Search app from the play store. The other issues still remain.

3fqpwt	-58598	1438692950	Insurance	My mum's car was hit, while it was parked, in an empty car park, I have the details of the other driver, but need advice on how to proceed, please!	So in a nutshell, we are based in the UK and whilst my mum was at work, another car, drove into the side of her car very badly in an empty car park, par one other car very far away from her's. The back left passenger door was very badly damaged and the car is now  a write off. The other driver found my mum and gave her, her details. The driver said that she doesn't want this to go through her insurance so that it doesn't affect her no claims bonus. We have already contacted my mum's insurer to let them know the situation. I need to know firstly if it is a good idea to let her deal with it as opposed to her insurance company? And if my mum will be entitled to compensation to the amount required to replace her current vehicle with one of a very similar spec? She is on a fully comprehensive plan, and is not at fault at all due to the circumstances (parked, open car park, not in the car). If the insurance company or the other driver doesn't offer a sufficient amount, what are my chances of a decent negotiation?Are we entitled to any extra money due to the inconvenience of the situation ?  Is there any other advice or things I should know? Thanks in advance! Please ask me for any other details you need.

3i4z9l	-58598	1440373958	askwomenadvice	Ladies, what are the rules of male friends giving presents to my girlfriend?	So,Long story short. There is this guy who my girlfriend (22) has had as a friend since she was 15.We're 2 months into our relationship and 1 month ago, he rang her, crying, and confessed to her that he was in love with her, and has been for 4 years.She told me everything, and asked me what I wanted to do. She said she didn't want to lose him as a friend, as he is also a close family friend.I said, you can keep being friends, because he was honest about his feelings and didn't try to slyly break us up, and in 7 years nothing had ever happened between them. So I felt relatively comfortable.In this month, he has given my girlfriend flowers, a toy dog, and today for her birthday a massive teddy-bear and hair straighteners that cost £255.Oh, and yesterday she was in hospital, she was given drugs and was heavily asleep, and he decided without asking to sleep head-toe with her. Another female friend of hers was in the room too. When my girlfriend found out she told me, and told me she was angry about him doing it.He used to give her flowers and stuff long before she met me, and nothing happened between them, but obviously I do not like this situation.Any advice? What should I do? Am I entitled to be angry with him(not with her)?Thanks in advance.

It's ride-able now, and I'm back enjoying the trails. http://imgur.com/cebYaNDThe one problem is the seat clamp. I went to drop the seat down last night, and noticed the allen-key was just spinning in the 'socket' (hole? can't think of the correct term!), as the 'hexagon shape' is now round.

I haven't had any coaching which has led me into not correcting this when it started. Recently, i've started to feel slight pain within my shoulder when serving, assuming it's to do with my technique. I usually serve at just below 100mph on average.The videos below show a duece court serve, and ad court serve, in normal speed and slow-mo.Any suggestions on how I can try and change my technique to prevent the probable shoulder problems in the future are appreciated!!![duece court](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbosbER9gS0)[ad court normal speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43bjOVMlW3I)   [ad court slo-mo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gtPEuXt0cM)Thanks!

Hi,My understanding of electronics is somewhat basic, I spent three years through high-school studying electronics, then moved onto a different career path. My problem is relatively simple.I have a battery powered pump (http://www.mabuchi-motor.co.jp/cgi-bin/catalog/e_catalog.cgi?CAT_ID=rs_360sh) and i'm trying to build a circuit that triggers the pump when the temperature exceeds ~32C degrees and then turns off when the temp drops below this threshold. My current idea was using a basic op amp circuit, of which i have got working at the correct temp, replacing the pump with LED. As far as i can remember, the op amp cant be used with the pump because of current issues?Is there any easy solution to my problem? (there probably is...) Any help is appreciated!!!Thanks.
jtg96	-58617	1314230019	islam	An interfaith problem I've observed	I was living in Cairo last summer when the Terry Jones scandal erupted. While the whole issue was unfortunate, it gave me a lot of great opportunities to talk to Egyptian Muslims about ḥarq al-muṣḥaf, public disrespect toward Islam and the prophet, etc. For a few weeks, everyone wanted to talk about such issues (ya‘nī more than usual).A number of educated Egyptians and other Arab Muslims told me that they strongly supported making hate speech directed at any religion and/or its scripture illegal. They always took care to mention that they would happily submit to such a law, since they would never dream of speaking hatefully about Jesus or the Bible. I started asking them how they felt about non-Abrahamic religions. Where did they come down on hate speech against Buddhism and Hinduism? Taking it a step further, how about Aḥmadiyya, Bahā'ī etc.?I was routinely disappointed at the way these questions threw my conversation partners for a loop. Not that they would react by making hateful remarks about non-Abrahamic religions. Again, these were educated and (I think) good-hearted people. But it was almost worse than if they had reacted with hatred. They didn't even seem to have a vocabulary for addressing interfaith issues outside the Abrahamic tradition.What have your experiences been? I have many friends who are quite enthusiastic about interfaith dialogue, including several Christians and Jews. It worries me that they seem to ignore (or want badly to paper over) the real difficulties that many Muslims, in particular, experience when trying to look beyond Semitic monotheism.I look forward to hearing your thoughts. And Ramadan Kareem!

tlmrb	-58617	1336952484	exmuslim	The great Imām al-Ash‘arī – hero or lunatic?	For those not familiar with Abu'l-Ḥasan al-Ash‘arī, he was a theologian in the rich intellectual community of Baghdad in the 3rd Islamic century (late 8th to late 9th centuries CE, mostly). This was the place and era of the greatest debate in classical Islamic theology. To simplify things, it was a debate over whether theological problems should be addressed through the use of rational arguments, or through cleaving to revelation and the traditions of the prophet. On the side of human reason were the Mu‘tazilite theologians, and on the side of accepting revelation on its own terms... well, we tend to call them the Ash‘arites! It's tricky to refer to Imām al-Ash‘arī as the "founder" of a "school", but he was the most famous early theologian to turn against Mu‘tazilite positions, and so his set of positions, and later scholars who share them, end up being called Ash‘arite.As I'm sure any of you would guess, the Ash‘arite position (anti-reason) on theological matters has been decisively victorious in the Sunni Islamic tradition. Many of the questions that were being debated in the 2nd and especially 3rd centuries of Islam have not seen serious debate since then, at least among Sunnis. I could talk a lot more about this, but I just wanted to put al-Ash‘arī in some context. He was an early opponent of rational theology in Islam. During his career, there was still a lively debate over basic theological questions, but in subsequent centuries his fundamental positions achieved permanent victory.On to the text! One of al-Ash‘arī's works is entitled "kitāb al-luma‘ fi'l-radd ‘alā ahl al-zaygh wa'l-bida‘". ("Highlights of the polemic against deviators and innovators") The work is structured like a Socratic dialogue, in which an imaginary interlocutor asks questions, to which al-Ash‘arī responds. You can find the Arabic text of the book at the following link:http://ia600300.us.archive.org/32/items/rodoud_Ach3ariya2/loma3.pdfOne snippet that I particularly enjoy occurs on pages 116-17 of the Arabic. Here's a translation by Richard McCarthy, from his book "The Theology of al-Ash‘arī" (Beirut: Imprimerie Catholique, 1953). I don't have a page number handy, but it wouldn't be hard to find. It's in section 7 of the original work, on whether God can be considered just or unjust. Without further ado:"'Is God free to inflict pain on infants in the next life?' God is free to do that, and in doing it He would be just. Likewise, whenever He inflicts an infinite punishment for a finite sin, and subordinates some living beings to others, and is gracious to some and not to others, and creates men knowing well that they will disbelieve – all that is justice on His part. And it would not be evil on the part of God to create them in the painful punishment and to make it perpetual. Nor would it be evil on His part to punish the believers and to introduce the unbelievers into the Gardens [of Paradise]. Our only reason for saying that He will not do that is that He has informed us that He will punish the unbelievers, and He cannot lie when He gives information.The proof that He is free to do whatever He does is that He is the Supreme Monarch, subject to no one, with no superior over Him who can permit, or command, or chide, or forbid, or prescribe what He shall do and fix bounds for Him. This being so, nothing can be evil on the part of God. For a thing is evil on our part only because we transgress the limit and bound set for us and do what we have no right to do. But since the Creator is subject to no one and bound by no command, nothing can be evil on His part.'Then lying is evil only because God has declared it to be evil?' Certainly. And if He declared it to be good, it would be good; and if He commanded it, no one could gainsay Him."I think the quotation speaks for itself. Just keep in mind who the author is. This is not a fringe theologian, and the arguments are not heterodox. This is probably the most beloved early theologian (read: before al-Ghazālī) among Sunnis. His positions are basically still in effect today. If you don't find yourself reading about views like these, then it's because they are no longer in serious debate.

1ubqqc	-58619	1388772673	leagueoflegends	How do you not lose against Master Yi?	I recently played a game of LoL, in promo for S2, where my bot and top didn't do so well and me in the middle, got around 5 kills in lane. I was laning against Master Yi as Syndra. So I crushed him. 30 minutes into the game it's pretty close and it's not obvious which team is winning, until, the 0-8 Master Yi manages to press R, right click my tanks, kill them in 4-5 autos, and run at the squishy back line, kill them (me included) in 2 autos. Now you are asking yourself "You're Syndra just combo him and he'll blow up!" well the problem with that idea is, he is untargetable. He alpha strikes you, which does 50% of your HP, and then autos you once or twice to finish the kill. The problem with that is Yi cannot be slowed, Yi cannot be targeted because of Alpha Strike, Yi cannot be hit by skillshots because he is running around 100000 mph, and then he proceeds to melt your tanks with true damage, then he runs straight at the squishes, which  cannot defend themselves, and kills them in 2 autos. Now I would LOVE to hear what in the hell I am supposed to do as Syndra when I can't target him, I can't hit him with my skillshots, to survive against Master Yi. In this specific game I had a Leona. You are probably thinking "Well if Leona just triple stuns Yi then you can FINALLY target him right?" The problem with that idea is Leona has to hit her E in order to start her combo. Master Yi runs around so fast and is alpha striking so often that it is near impossible to lock him down. If she tries to use her ultimate to lock him down he will simply laugh and run away from the ult with his insane movement speed. I suppose the only REAL way to stop Yi from literally destroying every champion on your team is to hit him with click on CC, granted he doesn't alpha strike first and is untargetable before you can click him, like nautilus ultimate. So with all this in mind, can someone please explain to me how to stop this champion from insta winning against me?
1ynwgc	-58619	1393114436	leagueoflegends	Why I have given up on LoL	I just had a ranked game where I was captain. I glanced to chat and saw something about nasus and shyvana, two highly banned champions. I thought okay this person wants to make sure those two are banned. So I banned Shyv and the other team banned Nasus. WHen it was time for the guy that had said previously something about Nasus and Shyv to pick, he wrote "wtf you banned them both. Okay time to feed". He locked Annie top lane, put clarity and cleanse, and went 1-9 and complained at the team the entire time. "Fuck you fuck this fuck that fuck this game" ect. It was like playing with a 8 year old. This guy's summoner name was GrannyGrinder. I went to his LoLking and found out that, if this guy doesn't get Nasus or Shyv in top lane, he trolls. Two games he didn't get nasus or shyv he went support Yorick. The game with me he didn't get Shyv or Nasus he went Annie clarity cleanse. Is there a way to get this guy banned? ASAP? I can't imagine a single person in the world that could enjoy playing with this immaturity, ESPECIALLY in ranked. I do realize this post is complaining, but I feel like this guy just needs to be banned. How would you like it if this happened to you?

(The correct answer is being a right Christian) I also ask, what is the better situation? Being a wrong atheist or being a wrong Christian? (They are identical) What is the logical explanation for following Atheism, when there is no reward for being right? Why not give yourself the best to making to it to heaven (if it exists)? Follow a religion, that if right, could result with you being in heaven? Atheists LOVE to talk about logic, and scientific reasoning. But it seems to me following Atheism is just about the most un-logical thing possible. It is the most simple probability problem imaginable. Yet Atheists are picking the wrong answer.  There are two possible scenarios here, (A) God exists or (B) does not exist. Lets pretend A and B are horses in a race. Putting your money on B is un-logical. Becauses even if B wins the race, guess what? You get nothing and the people who bet on horse A get nothing. Lets say you put your money on horse A. If horse A wins, guess what? You go to heaven and those who bet on horse B go to hell. WHY WOULD YOU BET ON HORSE B? That is my question. I'm not here to attack anybody or hurt feelings, I'm really just looking for some kind of logical explanation from one of you Atheist folk to the ideas that I have presented here.

Thank you!A 230-m-wide river has a uniform flow speed of 1.4 m/s through a jungle and toward the east. An explorer wishes to leave a small clearing on the south bank and cross the river in a powerboat that moves at a constant speed of 4.6 m/s with respect to the water. There is a clearing on the north bank 63 m upstream from a point directly opposite the clearing on the south bank. (a) At what angle, measured relative to the direction of flow of the river, must the boat be pointed in order to travel in a straight line and land in the clearing on the north bank? (b) How long will the boat take to cross the river and land in the clearing?What I have been trying is, multiplying 4.6 by the costheta and sintheta (theta being the angle the boats velocity points toward from west towards north) to get the components of the velocity and then subtracting 1.4 from the x component because of the rivers current. Then I get position information by integrating the velocity equations. I set the x component of the position equal to 63 and then solve for t. Then I plug that t into the y component of the position and try to solve for theta. I end up with 230costheta+63sintheta=70.  I tried to solve it and quickly realized it is pretty much impossible to find theta from that.

In one version of the act, Emanuel Zacchini was shot over three Ferris wheels to land in a net at the same height as the open end of the cannon and at a range of 67 m. He was propelled inside the barrel for 5.4 m and launched at an angle of 50°. If his mass was 88 kg and he underwent constant acceleration inside the barrel, what was the magnitude of the force propelling him? (Hint: Treat the launch as though it were along a ramp at 50°. Neglect air drag.)After some work I was able to calculate the magnitude of the velocity as the guy leaves the cannon. When he leaves the tip of the cannon he is traveling at about 26 m/s. So I know at the bottom of the ramp he has velocity 0. The propelling force pushes him 5.4 meters. At the end of that 5.4 meter displacement the body has velocity ~ 26 m/s. I also know that the force of gravity parallel to the ramp is 9.8sin(50) (which is pointing down the ramp). So I need a force that counteracts that force parallel to the ramp (so pushes it up the ramp), and after 5.4 meters gives the body velocity ~ 26 m/s. First, how do I calculate the magnitude of the acceleration that the net force on the body is? Then once I know that, I should be able to just multiply that number by 88 (mass) and then I'll have the force's magnitude in Newtons, right?Thanks so much for helping.

So I think okay its because he has a lot of armor maybe my mid and jungle that are ap can kill him. NOPE. He proceeds to walk on every member of my team get a total of 9 kills before the game ends and solo win the game. At the end he dealt a total of 32.6k dmg with a full tank build. He dealt the most damage in the entire game. He also tanked 60k dmg. 60k. The average player on our team took 30k. Is this champion broken? Is he faker? Here is a link to the game http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1761794619/204353782?tab=overviewI would appreciate it if someone could point out what I did wrong.
302m0o	-58619	1427153833	learnmath	[Uni Calc 3] Triple integrals	This is the question:Compute the integral of f(x, y, z) = y^2 over the region within the cylinder x^2 + y^2 = 4 where 0 ≤ z ≤ y.The bounds that I got for the triple integral are:z goes from 0 - 2y goes from 0 - (4-x^2)^(1/2)x goes from -2 - 2I integrate dzdydx.The first two integrals are simple and then I get to the dx one. 2/3(integral sign)-2 to 2 (4-x^2)^(3/2)dx. I trig sub x=2sintheta and then I change the bounds to 3pi/2 to pi/2 and when I solve the integral I get -4pi, which is wrong. Can somebody please tell me why its not working?

3dcl1c	-58619	1436937981	swift	Play background music in app?	I want the user to be able to open the app and have music start playing. I want the user to be able to go any view controller and return back to the initial one without the music stopping. I want it to loop indefinitely. I have tried to put in the viewDidLoad method of the initial view controller for it to start playing. What happens is, the user leaves the initial view controller and when they come back, the music starts playing again, overlapping the original copy. To remedy this, I put an if statement checking if the sound is already to playing to not launch another copy and the viewDidLoad method completely ignores the if statement and plays it again anyways. I also tried using viewDid/WillAppear. I have tried putting the sound in the app delegate in the applicationDidLaunchWithOptions method and I got complete silence. I have been trying everything I can think of. Please help me?! Thank you
3djzyz	-58619	1437083928	swift	Are my iAds setup correctly?	In my AppDelegate I have:var bannerView: ADBannerView!...func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -&gt; Bool {        // Override point for customization after application launch.    bannerView = ADBannerView(adType: .Banner)    return true}Then in my initial ViewController I have:override func viewDidLoad() {    super.viewDidLoad()    let appDelegate = UIApplication.sharedApplication().delegate as! AppDelegate    appDelegate.bannerView.hidden = true}Then in initial ViewController I also have:override func viewDidAppear(animated: Bool) {    super.viewDidAppear(animated)    let appDelegate = UIApplication.sharedApplication().delegate as! AppDelegate    view.addSubview(appDelegate.bannerView)    appDelegate.bannerView.setTranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints(false)    appDelegate.bannerView.delegate = self    self.canDisplayBannerAds = true    let viewsDictionary = ["bannerView": appDelegate.bannerView]    view.addConstraints(NSLayoutConstraint.constraintsWithVisualFormat("H:|[bannerView]|", options: .allZeros, metrics: nil, views: viewsDictionary))    view.addConstraints(NSLayoutConstraint.constraintsWithVisualFormat("V:[bannerView]|", options: .allZeros, metrics: nil, views: viewsDictionary))}func bannerViewDidLoadAd(banner: ADBannerView!) {    let appDelegate = UIApplication.sharedApplication().delegate as! AppDelegate    appDelegate.bannerView.hidden = false}func bannerView(banner: ADBannerView!, didFailToReceiveAdWithError error: NSError!) {    let appDelegate = UIApplication.sharedApplication().delegate as! AppDelegate    appDelegate.bannerView.hidden = true}Now to the issue I'm having. When I segue from the initial ViewController to another ViewController and then back to the initial ViewController, the iAd doesn't appear. I believe this is because when I segue BACK to the initial VC the viewDidLoad method is being run again which is hiding the ad. Also, another ad is not being loaded, so the bannerViewDidLoadAd method is not being run so it's not Unhiding the ad. This results in the initial ViewController's iAd not displaying. Anybody have any suggestions as to how to remedy this?

Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**Mainly Dota 2 and Iracing. Some light programming. &gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** $800&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** Not sure. &gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** Just the tower. &gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** Toronto, Ontario, Canada  &gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** Crappy Dell keyboard and mouse. I have a bunch of old monitors that still work, 3 Dell and 2 Asus ranging in size from 19' to 23'. Still have the HD from my old computer which I could possibly use.   &gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** If it is not that hard and there is a serious befit from it I would be down to overclock right away.&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**It would be nice if I could get a dual or triple monitor setup going but its not necessary. A modular PSU would be nice if its not that expansive. I want to focus mainly on CPU and GPU performance.   &gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**It would be cool if that case had a bunch of LEDs but my budget is really to low to go after such luxury's &gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**Nope, I have a copy of windows 8Thanks for your help!

If you'd like to continue the discussion I'm on twitter [@greenbackd](https://twitter.com/Greenbackd) too.

I'm sure I'll get it trouble for spamming my shit on the internet, so I'll stick around for a while and answer questions about being in Psych grad school if people want. I'm in a General Experimental program trying to get a M.S.Here's the link to the survey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/TPGCBLNIt's pretty short and really innocuous.

a5i0d	-58689	1258517425	reddit.com	Reddit: A local animal rescue near me needs your help! 	I work at a vet clinic in illinois. The other day a rescue that works with us regularly (pets without parents) brought in one of their dogs that had been hit by a car. They had apparently made an exception to allow a family to "try out" a dog they had up for adoption named sasha. They warned this family that sasha was a known escape artist but 30min after this family brought sasha home she escaped the backyard while unattended. The next day sasha was hit by a car on a local interstate. A kind lady (not the person who hit sasha) stopped and sasha didn't die on that interstate but she still needs your help reddit!The problem is that one of sasha's rear legs was broken (into at least 7 pieces) and on the other side her hip was fractured/broken in another 2 places. Sasha needs extensive orthopedic work on at least one leg but the rescue she is with works on almost nothing and are also trying save a litter of parvo puppies (among other animals). The bills are adding up way to fast for Pets w/o Parents and they are worried they will have to put sasha down. Please help them by donating. Even a dollar is one more step towards saving a soul that never hurt anyone and only asked us for love. You can donate at http://bn.craigslist.org/pet/1466162450.htmldisclaimer:: I wouldn't normally post something like this but Sasha is special. Its a general policy at my clinic to muzzle dogs that are severely injured but, despite a crushed backend which must be EXTREMELY painful,  sasha never tried to bite or growl. She just told us she trusted us with her eyes and tried to endure. It broke my heart every time we had to move her. She was trying to wag her tail at us when we came to get her for x-rays.

bgyib	-58689	1269324536	redditcookbook	USAF Yakisoba	This recipe was given to my parents by a japanese friend when they lived on an air force base outside of tokyo in the 80's and subsequently adapted to fit their low-budget and midwest sensibilities. The joy of this recipe is its adapatability to the contents of almost any fridge so get creative! Also keep in mind that the measurements for seasonings are very estimated. I tend to cook by sight rather then measurement!    1 lb meat (sausage, beef, pork, chicken, hot dogs, bacon, etc)     3 c. chopped cabbage (napa, bok choy, etc)     vegetables (tend to use 1/2 -3/4c. ea carrots, bean sprouts &amp; water chesnuts but often substitute others)        3-4 cloves garlic (+more or less depending on your love of garlic)    1/2-3/4 c. onion     5 packets ramen noodles (2 packets oriental, the other 3 either pork or beef)     1 egg    soy sauce    ground ginger    ground red pepper    ground pepper    salt1. In large pan (preferably wok but any high-sided pan will do and it is possible using multiple pans, and making a huge mess, to make this without a high-sided pan or wok) brown meat while seasoning with light coating of ginger (about 1 Tablespoon) and 1-2 teaspoons of red pepper and a little less then one tablespoon of soysauce2. start a large pot of water boiling3.add onions and garlic to meat4. push the meat to the outer edges of pan making a "well" that reaches the bottom of the hot pan. crack your egg into this well and scramble mixing into the rest of the meat when it reaches the "firm wet" stage. 5. add cabbage, carrots and any vegetable that will take around the same amount of time to cook. continue to turn over vegetables and meat to prevent burning6. season with 1 packet oriental and 1 packet meat-flavor7. add rest of vegetables8. add all 5 packets of noodles to the boiling water cook ~2 1/2 minutes (al dente)9. drain noodles from water add to pan of vegetables/meat10. dust remaining 3 packets of seasoning on noodles while stiring them into the vegetables and meat.11. done when noodles are evenly coated and everything is stirred together. eat and enjoy!serves about 3-4 hungry college boys or around 6 normal people =] makes great leftovers! Also you can take 1/3 of the vegetable/meat mixture pre-noodles (after step 7) and use it as filling for eggrolls which you then fry while waiting for the noodles to boil (or if you are like me and forgot to put the water on at the beginning you can fry while waiting for the water to boil and the noodles to cook!)edited for formatting

For a short time reddit believed in grandpas who understood us and could connect with us. We believed in living happily ever-after fully engaged in our own lives. How many of us felt special because grandpawiggly specifically responded to you and gave you his time. How many of us called our own grandpas to reconnect? Grandpawiggly gave us a gift imo and we need to get over our anger to cherish the time that we did believe.

The problem child of the bunch is a very long thin bed (14' x 1.5') that is halfway overrun with grass.  So my great plan is to edge it (to keep the grass out) then use one end for permanent herbs and plant the other 3/4ths with asparagus. I know asparagus grows wild in the fields around here (I regularly come out and harvest it) but I'm not entirely sure what goes into establishing domesticated crowns. Any tips/ suggestions?

(when I'm not being lazy) I blister no matter what :( so its kinda a planning issue to get them trimmed. I'm still messing around with how thin and what shape. The makeup suggestions are great. I'll be buying some of the stuff you guys recommended and trying them out asap. Hair: I really don't think the hairdressers around where I live are as dependable as where you guys live :( They always want to give me the "I've-given-up" bob or go nuts with dye and perms. My hair looks the way it does because I've never dyed it or done anything beyond normal day to day damage so I'm really not comfortable risking it all for a new color. That being said I was think of getting some light highlights this summer. I'm definitely going to start more actively looking for a hairstylist that I feel I can trust the way you guys seem to trust your stylists! I didn't even realize you could trust a hairstylist that much :( Is it like bras where money actually makes a measurable difference? **thank you!**

I have access to a very hardy, very productive grove and blessing to remove seedlings to trade to anyone who wants them. My friend, the owner, just throws the seedlings out each year. For anyone interested, mulberries only sprout after the seeds have been digested by a creature and left in poop somewhere hospitable. Seedlings would be between 6"-12" and shipped quickly. Mulberries are very hardy in the Midwest and into  Canada. (I've heard they thrive really anywhere with little work). They produce blackberry-like fruit in large quantities every year. The fruit is sweeter and much less tart then blackberries. Mulberries are very popular in jams and wine around here. [Central Illinois]EDIT:: I am interested in fruiting vines (blackberries, raspberries,etc) and almost every type of veggie particularly heirlooms and specifically zone 5b hardy. I won't be able to send out seedlings until I have identified and dug them up so sometime this spring.

1irrpy	-58689	1374442309	ilstu	Gaming group that doesn't meet on Wednesday?	Hello! I was hoping someone here might have a lead on a gaming group that doesn't meet on Wednesdays. I would love to take part in the big boardgame group that I know meets Wednesdays but I usually work and my boyfriend has class. My gaming group is down to just the two of us after our other members moved for various life reasons. I haven't had any luck trying out the local game store so I'm hoping someone here has a lead for me to follow up on! We play any boardgame and would really love to get in on an pen and paper game. We both have experience both as players and as DMs and own a decent selection of boardgames and books. Thanks! EDIT:: Yay! So those of you interested in starting up a group- I'm thinking we should meetup sometime soon-ish to 1. meet each other and 2. coordinate some gaming! Where and when works for you? Jake and I live over in Bloomington and would like to suggest next Tuesday at Denny's (on Veterans) or Meatheads (on Veterans) but we are willing to drive. Any time all day Tuesday works for either of us. Other days/times we would have to coordinate a bit more.

1izwjo	-58689	1374714862	ilstu	Anyone willing to help move a monster of a desk?	So I found the deal of the year on craigslist. A beautiful ginormous desk like I've always wanted! It weighs a metric f*ton and I live in a basement apartment but, I thought to myself, with judicious use of cardboard for sliding I should be able to wriggle it into my computer room. Wrong. This sucker is now down the stairs stashed in a utility closet right outside my apartment door because it physically can't fit through the door without one of the legs coming off. The problem is that I do not own a power drill or have the muscle power to get the line of very secure screws out without mechanical powered aide. I spent 2 hours just trying different angles to get it in so I can state with all certainty that, if that leg does not come off, I have thrown money down the toilet and lost a dream. Can anyone help me?

In the wake of the tornadoes today the Home Depot where I work immediately initiated our emergency response. Both my store and one 16min from Washington had shipments of generators, lumber, water and emergency supplies on the way almost immediately. Our regional and district management have been picking up and personally transporting needed items from Chicago stores to us. Both stores opted to stay open overnight. Associates called every single employee of Home Depot on the roster of both stores to make sure everyone was alright, even those who didn't live near tornado damaged areas. We already have a group of volunteers ready to head out tomorrow to help however we can.I just think its amazing. I never thought our store would respond to a local emergency but within minutes of news of the storm hitting, my store manager already had the local county emergency management on the line offering help. Home Depot's commitment to community actually means something. Just like the stores in Joplin MO, West TX, along the path of Sandy, along the paths of the Colorado and southwest fires. Just like the stores who have responded to every emergency near a Home Depot, we are going to make a difference in our community. And I am proud of the company I work for.

I have been attempting to learn enough about tooling to feel comfortable with buying a side of veg tanned leather to actually make something. Since I kinda feel I'm at that point, I thought I would ask all you experienced people your thoughts and advice. I am also curious on how you finish/condition your leather. I have heard that I could use coconut oil or olive oil but I can't really find any advice on how to actually apply the oil to freshly tooled veg tanned leather. Everything I find is on how to apply it to boots, saddles, etc with a warning that you do NOT apply to fresh veg tanned leather the same way. My attempts to self teach have all come up blotchy :(Thanks for any help, opinions and advice!

I work for a company that informally has me do everything that a Community Outreach Specialist would do, in addition to a demanding sales job, and I've learned that I absolutely LOVE working community outreach! I've started to put together a resume but I'm having trouble with really showcasing why I am amazing at community outreach. I would really like some direction on how to organize my information.In short, I don't have a bachelors. (health took me out of school and money has kept me out) What I do have is an accomplished history of creating, implementing, and following through with community outreach. (almost entirely while working for this one company) How do I go about highlighting the projects, programs and events I've almost single-handedly coordinated?

I have a wonderful granite slab and have been happily pounding away but I've found that my wooden table has a definite bounce to it that makes a lot of noise and, more importantly, takes away the power of my tooling hits. Its bad enough that I've resorted to tooling with my leather on my floor in order to have consistent hits. I've heard that you can buy rubber mats to go under your granite that will stop power from being lost to the table underneath. Does anyone have a recommendation for a mat? I would really like to be able to purchase it via Amazon to take advantage of a giftcard and free shipping from there. Edit: Ok sounds like I need to find a bigger slab of granite! Mine is only 1/2'' thick. I called a granite supply shop nearby and they are going to give me any scrap I want from their hopper for free!

248cri	-58689	1398728884	cats	6 month old kitten peeing outside litterbox. Help!	I have a 2 year old Maine Coon mix and in November I found a kitten on the side of the road that my vet estimated was 8 weeks old at the time. This kitten (we named her Pixel) is very lovey and seemed to use the litterbox while isolated from my older cat for a couple weeks. When we started to let her explore the house we had a couple issues with pooping outside the litterbox. We watched her carefully and would run her to the litterbox when she started scratching and otherwise indicating she was going to need to pee/poop. We also vigorously clean any spot she has an accident in. She stopped pooping outside the litterbox but in the 4 months we've had her she consistently has had issues with peeing. In those 4 months we have seen the vet (no issues there), changed the litter, bought a 2nd litterbox (she didn't like to use the 1st one if the older cat was in it already and would not wait for him to finish), and we have done our best to reinforce litterbox = good. She still only uses it to pee when it's convenient for her it seem like. If she is near a litterbox and our older cat is not currently using that litterbox, she will use the litterbox. If she doesn't feel like walking across the room, it's occupied, there is a piece of attractive paper to pee on nearer to her.. It has become so frustrating!I have owned cats my whole life and have experienced a cat with urinary tract infections. Pixel doesn't give any sign of an infection or stones or anything. She has also never attempted to cover her business. I'm wondering if she just does not have the natural instinct to cover her excrement that other cats have. She has effectively destroyed the brand new carpet in my apartment and I'm tired of cleaning pee up nearly daily in an attempt to make sure she associates no one spot with "toilet". Not to mention how expensive urine destroying cleaners are. I am desperate for advice on how to train her. She is so sweet! It would break my heart to send her out to be a farm cat. 
253upn	-58689	1399612619	Leatherworking	Dyeing tooled leather: Eco-flo vs Fiebrings (or something else?)	I am fast approaching the dyeing stage of my first MtG playmat. It is a 16in by 24in, hand tooled piece with a lot of detail. [Here is my piece in progress](http://imgur.com/a/00sfu) Originally, I was going to use Eco-Flo water based stains to dye the tree white-ish, leaves red, wolf grey, and the background a washed out grey (or possibly a dark grey). As I get more and more tooling done, I'm concerned that the Eco-Flo will hide or minimize the tooling reducing the overall impact of the piece. Do any of you with experience dyeing leather have any recommendations to stop that from happening? Should I stick with one color? Would a stain with higher absorption like an oil based Fiebrings dye have better tone and emphasis on the tooling? Tl;Dr - My thoughts are if I wanted the paint to be the star, I wouldn't have spent so much time tooling! How do I make the tooling really pop with stains?

I've been fighting a steadily worsening flare-up of my IBS-D for the last 6 weeks. Last night I was barely able to get any sleep due to cramping, gas, and a sharp stabbing pain in my left side (about 3inches off from my belly button). Today that stabbing pain is still present although it relaxes to a burning ache while I'm laying down. I've had this pain before due to an ulcer in my colon but I don't have blood in my stool so I don't think its bleeding. My concern is today my feet and especially my hands keep going numb/tingling if they are used at all. Even typing this I feel like my fingers are fat and going numb. Its a Saturday so there is no way I can see a DR until Monday unless I go to the ER. I really don't want to go there and have them just tell me to suck it up cause this is what IBS does. Anyone else have experience with these symptoms? 
2c441h	-58689	1406695490	legaladvice	[Illinois] My work refused to recognize absences under FMLA and has fired me for those absences.	I filed for FMLA and was approved in December 2013. When I filed with my work, I asked for all the details on how to submit and was told to just tell them when I call in to report I will be absent. My work (Home Depot) holds absences until they meet a "violation" threshold or a 3 month expiration. I received a write up for absences in January. When I asked why they weren't covered by FMLA, I was told it didn't matter because it was only a warning. I was too good an employee to ever be fired was the line used by management. My second write-up, I asked again why they weren't being covered by FMLA and was told it was because I wasn't filling out a weekly form listing each FMLA leave day taken and signed by myself and a manager. It was presented as something management would present me with each week to sign. Again I was told the write-up was just a formal thing that didn't mean anything for my actual employment (i was getting suspicious at this point...) Last week I was given a Final Notice for attendance issues. I again insisted the large majority of dates listed (spanning over 6 weeks) I had notified them of FMLA leave. I asked why I hadn't seen the sheet to sign from them and was told it was my responsibility to find, fill out, and have management sign that sheet. When I asked them where to find that sheet, they told me to just go look. I insisted they show me and we discovered its not a form at all but an online data entry system they have to access. I was still written up. I called the State Department of Labor and was told it was likely just a communication issue and to call back if they actually fired me. Well they did. Sunday I went to the ER before my shift started and was in the ER for 6 hours. I was in a lot of pain when I returned home and failed to call them. I intended to notify them on my next day back to work but was not recovered and called in. They have shut down all my company logins and intend to fire me tomorrow. I will be calling the Labor Department back tomorrow. Could anyone give me an idea on my options, what I should prepare for, and my chances at unemployment? Work is claiming I No-Call, No-Showed the day I was in the ER. It looks like I have 2 business days from the day I return to work to report FMLA though. Should I find a lawyer?

Age -27, Sex- female, Height- 6ft, Weight- 239lbs, Race- whiteDuration of complaint - Itching started off mildly about 2 days ago. Has escalated to something that can not be ignored. Taking all my concentration to NOT rip my skin off. I have a light, red speckle type rash on my upper chest, upper back, and upper arms. The itching does not appear to concentrate at all in those areas.Location (Geographic and on body) - all over Any existing relevant medical issues (if any) - Saturday Nov. 29th I started experiencing a stiff neck, by that Monday I had a migraine and low grade fever every night, by Wednesday I was puking. Wednesday I went to a local promptcare and was sent immediately to the ER. The ER discovered my liver enzymes were high [AST: 243, ALT: 445, Alkaline Phosphate: 154]. They also tested for Meningitis using a spinal tap. Wednesday night, Thursday, and Friday I was unable to stand or sit upright for longer then 30min-1hr before passing out from pain and nausea. Friday, I was sent by my family DR to the ER for a blood patch and potentially to be admitted. Drs at the ER rested my liver enzymes and discovered they were continuing to rise [[AST: 391, ALT: 821, Alkaline Phosphate: 243] A blood patch was administered which allowed me to sit up without excessive pain. I was sent home. Monday my family Dr confirmed an Epstein-Barr blood test had shown positive for an acute Epstein-Barr infection. I was told to go to the ER if my skin or eyes turned yellow. Otherwise just call to check in once a week or so for 2 weeks before retesting bloodwork. In general, I have low-pain (a small amount in my left abdomen) but high fatigue. Every time I rest the burning and itching in my skin builds to levels I can not ignore. I'm trying to rub (not scratch) and avoid any touch where possible. Current medications (if any)- None currently, 48 hours since last hydrocodone for pain (from blood patch), 24hr + since last anti-nausea medWhat can I do to make the itching stop? I mentioned mild, ignorable itching to the nurse I talked to today. She told me it was from excess toxins not being processed by my liver but I didn't need to worry unless I turned yellow. Is that true for even the extreme skin crawling itchiness I have now?

2zs3nb	-58689	1426914493	gardening	TIL Calgary Pears are now considered an invasive species in the Midwest	Pretty much the standard decorative tree of the last 15 years, Calgary pears were sold as "sterile" and "low or non- fruiting". You see them in nearly every parking lot, along streets, etc. They are one of the first trees to bloom in the spring in an explosion of white that smells like rotting corpses. (Visit Chicago in early Spring. You'll smell what I mean) Whelp, turns out they just can't pollinate themselves. (All Calgary pears are genetically the same) We planted so many that someone decided to improve or introduce novel traits by crossing in other types of pears. One of those new cultivars was different enough it was able to pollinate Calgary pear. The offspring revert to a wild type that doesn't look like Calgary pear but can pollinate it. So now we have literally thousands of supposedly "sterile" Calgary pears suddenly producing boatloads of undesirable fruit and invading native woods and landscapes! Sources- Illinois Department of Natural Resources - First Detectors Training hosted in Bloomington, ILEdit- CALLERY pear. Sorry folks, the gentleman who taught me has a thick accent.

When I did this a large green coloured spark came from the back of the computer and every plug that was also plugged in stopped working. I tried plugging the computer into a different plug downstair but it didn't work.Please can somebody help me, I have had the computer for about two weeks and I really hope I don't have to spend another £1000 on a new computer. *EDIT*Thanks for all of the hope, I'll head up to the shop on monday and get me my repairs no matter what they say.

First of all he didn't practise it at all, he told us if it didn't work out it didn't work out and that's how he prefers it. Secondly he only came up with 24hrs before the event..

Your turn next year Santa Clara* A new version of "john Cena sucks". Wasn't that far away from his parents and the look on their faces was priceless, All I can say is it will stay with me a long ass time and it continued onto the streets* The emo sting was truly the most depressing person in the building and even asking him leaving the building if he was ok, I got no response. I swear he was going to cry.. Spending that sort of money and not even cracking a smile the whole night..* After the trophy was broke we had a crew member try clean up the mess and the whole crowd started a "sweep sweep" chant and a "thank you sweeper" he got a kick out of it for what I assume is a thankless task.* Batista really behaves like a whiny turd , two nights in a row I have witnessed him in the dark waiting for his opponents to come out and all he does is complain about the ring surface , kept wiping his shoes and screaming at crew about it where no one else before or after him had anything to comment on on both nights. Such a primadonna. * Cesaro segment , singing of his entrance music was priceless and seems to be another new thing for 2014 ,joining Paul Heyman was one of the loudest pops I have ever heard.* Hounds Of Justice chant was gold , those facemasks we're such a talking point , merchandise apocalypse waiting to happen.* DBryan post show said that his run to the title started on royal rumble night and that the crowd reaction (well done Pittsburg)really made it happen. Got pretty emotional towards the end..* Ziggler was on the pre show and lost to Ryback, hell of a pop though.* "he has the whole world in his hands" you couldn't hide Harpers smile as the whole crowd swayed side to side , they have truly arrived.* " you still got it " to RVD was priceless too* Late edit for the "3MB" chant crowd started when Batista, orton and HHH were beating down on Bryan. It's the new evolution!That's it. Exhausted after an awesome 5 days in New Orleans. Great city for such an event like this.

1373sl	-58706	1352922752	BreakUps	I dont love her anymore but for some reason she wont get out of my head. Help me out here.	I (22m) She(18f) at the time.broke up with me over a year ago. I forgot why, maybe because it was a lame reason who knows. Then she randomly shows up in front of my door step late at night to give me a birthday present. I ask her if she wanted to hang out again and she said no and that it wouldnt work or something.Started hanging out with her at the beginning of this year, things went well we acted like we were together when ever we were alone, we even had intercourse a lot.Later on our friendship was on and off due to her saying she cant hang out with me or be with me because of our past.But somehow are friendship would start again.Then she ignores me for a week after we have a very intimate evening, it was valentines day I believe. She finally calls to meet up with me somewhere and we had a huge argument leading to us never speaking to each other again.A month later she has a going away party because shes moving and all. I decide to show up to get some closure out of all this (me being confused and very self conscious at this point). She didnt seem to listen at all.We added each other on facebook not long after she moves. Not even a month later she decides to block me. But before this happened she was saying that I comment on everything even her friends stuff. Im friends with them so it gives me the right to ya know. But with her she told me to get the sign or the impression that she didn't want to talk to me and that I comment on alot of her posts, she then ended this with saying  (no hard feelings). I told her I was just being silly and that    I do that to alot of my friends. I apologized and told her I would do it so much if it bothers her so much. What lead to her blocking me was when I did one final comment on a serious post she did. I was telling the facts and stuff.This was about 3-4 months ago and I havent even bothered to text or message her at all since then.I don't know, maybe im a bad guy for trying to start a normal friendship with her. Or maybe I had it coming to me.I forgot about it moved on and now im seeing someone. But once in a while memories of her randomly come to mind whether good or bad making me feel self conscious about my self and sad. I even thought about seeing some kind of therapist or someone about fixing this problem but I decided not to. Instead I choose you guys men and women to help me out here.Is are all these feeling because I feel I didnt get the closure I want? or is there something deeper than that I dont know about? I even woke up from a dream about her and I arguing, her friends portrayed truth and reality I think. they were saying she doesnt love me anymore and others things I know already.I need some kind of advice anything to help me out here. Im so confused. I keep remembering certain things she said before and her actions.One more thing: Did I mention that not long after our break up that she started to smoke weed again? and that 3 months after the break up she decides to take shrooms while camping and had sex with a mutual friend? just thought Id share that. I can share more If you ask.Please help me. Im so confused.Edit: during the time we started hanging out again she was always smoking weed and even drove around high picking up her friend or me. I even tried smoking with her to get closer to her I guess, I even bought her a beautiful bong for her birthday. but those were the only times I smoked that stuff. I dont really do that.I remember her saying that she likes jerks and that I get like a girl when I worry too much. Is it that wrong to be a sensitive guy?  I didnt realize I could add so much more. than just a paragraph, damn memories. Edit: Thank you for taking your time to read this if you do.
13k8p6	-58706	1353497518	magicTCG	Is this deck fully legal in modern? or are there some cards I should take out.	Since I heard modern is gonna be in Fnm next year I thought I would try to make a deck.http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/artifact-beats/I have all the time in the world to find these cards since modern seems like a format I don't have keep up with.My only question is if this deck is fully modern legal.I wouldn't mind Suggestions and opinions.
14a0wp	-58706	1354651625	magicTCG	Need advice about some cards.	I have a playset of entombs (graveborn edition). Should I hold on to them forever or should I just trade them in. I am both a collector and a player. As much as I love them I sometimes feel like I could get something else out of them.What should I do :(
14w2zt	-58706	1355568935	loseit	I want to get fit and slim up and look better, that is my new years resolution. Can I get some pointers or advice? Details inside.	(soon to be 24) male here. I weigh about 250, I have never worked out or tried out any form of fitness or weight loss exercise.The closest i have done to that is doing granite work (lifting and carrying granite slabs) and chasing people down when I was a security guard. Other than that I think ive played tag football and dance dance revolution.I have what is called an average looking body, no features just average. I want to slim up, get fit, and gain some muscle(or at least make it visible).If I hadnt gone through the heartbreak, rejection, absence in confidence, loss of courage, or the self esteem. I would be completely ok and proud of the fact or what I look like, But im not. I want my confidence back and all that other stuff.Now that you know the details of my weight and body type I would like to what I should do or what things to follow. Thank you for taking your time to read this.

Shortly after a very painful headache follows.Im 24 and I feel like I slow my friends down because I dont wanna drink when we go to bars or other events.I call it the asian blush. 
15rrby	-58706	1357046518	BreakUps	For those who have gone through alot of heart break, how can you get over it so easily?	There are some who dwell on it and there are others who get over it easily.I for one do both, I can go about my life without a single care in the world but when someone mentions my ex I just get sad for some reason. Not sad as in I wanna get back with them. But sad as in that I wont be able to have a normal friendship anymore.How you folks handle yours? I would love answers from both sexes. Edit* I would also like to hear some of your stories.

I am a 24m. Im unemployed, I only have 1 semester of college education under my belt. I do the same shit everyday like hanging out with friends and playing video games and occasionally go out to a bar or go see a movie.I cant stand being alone for some reason, I just love having intimate contact with a lovely lady. I try to do the benefits thing but I always mess it up because I end up falling in love.I stay with my mom so I can help her out with bills, But being out of a job sucks and its stressing me out.My father tells me that I can go to the philippines  to live there with a relative and to go to school so I can find a job easier here in america.Or I could move to alaska and live with another relative there and instantly have a job because of that relative.I want to better myself, I want to lose weight, I wanna quit smoking, I want to be better than I am now but at the same time I like who I am currently.Im still looking for a job looking at craigslist and applying places, heck my mother said she can try to get me a job at front desk at a hotel. Also I met someone who is awesome. We are going on dates, Shes very nice,caring, and very intimate.I just don't know what to do anymore, What if I cant find a job? What things end up bad between her and I? Maybe im scared of change. Maybe ive become so used to my daily habits that I wouldn't know what life would be without it.Im scared, and I dont know what to do. Thanks for reading this.

18899a	-58706	1360466922	magicTCG	So I joined my first PTQ today! (modern)	I did a horrible decision of playing eggs. I'm completely new to it and sort of know the what and what not to do's. I pretty much made the deck the night before and wanted to try it out today.Its a tough deck, at some points I won by grape shot for 25, then I would end up killing my self by not drawing into what I need. I was even so focused on the combo that I ended up milling myself!Just thought id let this out. Thanks for reading! 
190hgv	-58706	1361524342	sex	I'm conflicted and I don't know what to do! (I couldn't find the right enough subreddit so ill give it a try here) 	24M here, I met a girl the other day 20F(I was at work volunteering) I helped her out with some stuff and sat with her and had conversations and what not (the job was very casual since it was a lan center). I thought she was very cute and attractive at the same time, I wish I could find a word combining the two. I planned to ask for her number later on but she beat me to it by asking me for mine. Let me mention now that she told me that she went to swingers clubs and wanted to break the habit by doing something else like going to gaming hence the lan center. It all sounded weird to me because I have never met anyone who has gone to swingers clubs. I'm naive to all this I guess. At the end of the night I had to ask a friend for a ride home and I heard her say "Ill take you home!" I ignored it thinking I was hearing things since we have just met that day. I sent her a text "hello!" and she replied with "I missed you" I thought she was just being silly. A few text messages later I find that she actually wanted to take me to her place to have intercourse with me.I just wanted to get to know her because I thought shes pretty rad minus the swingers club thing, But I didn't expect someone wanting to take me to their place just for sex. I told her that I wasn't a fan of one night stands and was more of a relationship kind of guy. She told me wasn't the relationship type, I ask her why and she says that her relationships where just sex, coming over to ones place and sex. Then at some point she cooked dinner for this one guy and then sex. No holding hands no kissing nor cuddling. I am the complete opposite of that! I like my relationships to be intimate with the whole package:holding hands,kissing,cuddling, sex! you know? She also told me that she doesn't kiss the people she has sex with.  We left off at there.Fast forward to today she came to my work again but only for a few hours, This time I wanted to be a gentleman so I walked her to her car. We talked for a few minutes and we kissed before she went home. I have not had sex with her.Part of me wants to give in and just have sex with her. And the other part wants to try to be in a relationship with her showing that its alot more enjoyable than just sex. Maybe I'm still too naive for this stuff. I don't know what to do. Will you folks share some light to this? Thank you for taking the time to read this.
19l95s	-58706	1362339160	Swingers	Going on our first date next week to a swingers club.	(m) I met this girl who came into my work. Shes a swinger and i'm not, but im open to trying out new things. Can anyone tell me how to not be nervous or some protocols to take or what to expect?So far I know that No means NO is rule number one. What I've learned so far from her is that some guys just go in and just masturbate there and wait till a partner grabs then. Also nice people usually get invited by couples. Its a nice social scene I've heard but I don't wanna walk in and see some dudes masturbate. I just wanna socialize but ill feel weird somehow because of the atmosphere.Is it okay for me to be honest and say that ill feel awkward if anything happens to me other than my date?I really want to know everything and I will happily listen and learn advice.

104otv	-58709	1348050751	roblox	 Apocalypse Rising guide	As you can see by my username, I know a lot about Dayz, and im hoping I can bring some of my Dayz knowledge to one of my favourite games on Roblox calledApocalypse Rising.STARTING OUT When you first spawn you start with three perks, Adrenaline, when your health is under 30% this perk allows you to run faster and regenerate your health.Ninja, this perk allows you to be silent and you will have to be closer to zombies for them seeing you and chasing after you. Cardio, this perk allows you to be faster, nothing to say about that. Survivalist, this perk allows you to survive longer without food or drinks. I myself choose cardio and ninja, because me being a bandit, i need to get out of areas quick.SPAWNINGNormally you will spawn on the coast, DO NOT GO IN THE WATER. As soon as you spawn head to the nearest town, bad towns to head to are Amend. Tons of players and zombies cross this route to get to Mil Airfield. Delve this place, does not have a lot of players, but a lot of zombies. Airfield, both Trinity Airfield and Mil airfield have a lot of players and zombies around. So basically the nearest towns, try to find food, try not to pick up more ammo for your Markarov, unless you have a bigger backpack, So what you need is . rifle 3-4 mags. makarov 4 mags. a bunch of food and drinksADVANCEDAfter you have all of the stuff above, head to the forest, I believe it is north of Trinity Airfield, head to the underground bunker and loot whatever you can, if you do not find anything good, quit the game and join another server. Once you got something good, head back to trinity airfield, normally Trinity airfield does not have a lot of guns, but may contain ammo, next head to Mil airfield, this is usually filled with a lot of guns and ammo, just use the quit game and join other server method and get ammo, after you come from the forest, make sure you have a large backpack.PVPSo in player-vs-player combat, you need to aim at your opponents head, make sure you don't have a lot of zombies in the way, before you open fire and your a bandit like me, stalk the player for a few minutes, make sure they don't have buddies, so when you open fire, keep on firing, if you run out of ammo, switch to another gun, So that it peace out guys.

Next due to Glenn being really angry and with Michonne the two head to Woodbury to likely kill the Governor and based off the comics some bad craps gonna happen.

2mi5ni	-58712	1416178094	ps2	The spinning lights on the system menu actually have meaning!	[Source](http://wikibin.org/articles/playstation-2-internal-display-clock.html)The 7 spinning lights "merge" 12 times per minute, into a number of lights determined by the lowest common denominator of the current number of seconds with 60. For instance, at :30, they merge into two lights since the lowest common denominator of 30 and 60 is 2. The lights all merge into one at :00, and at the point of the circle where an hour hand would be.Additionally, if your menu just has one stationary light instead of a spinning circle of lights, it probably means the RTC battery in your console is dead.Some coders must have had so much fun making this :D(Yes, I know that the recently-posted "did you know" video mentioned this, but it was vague about how the lights actually relate to the time.)

3ghyro	-58712	1439233716	ZeroEscape	Does anyone else here live in southern Germany? I'm interested in maybe teaming up and playing a Live Room Escape in Stuttgart.	I found these two Live Room Escape games:http://www.exitgames-stuttgart.de/en/http://liveroomescape.de/and I'm considering trying one of them out this weekend. However, it'd be both expensive and probably less fun to do it by myself. (€99 per play, which could of course be split among the team.) Anyone want to join in?
3h8e73	-58712	1439755582	ZeroEscape	Update: ExitGames Stuttgart	(Update to [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroEscape/comments/3ghyro/does_anyone_else_here_live_in_southern_germany_im/))I ended up challenging the [Biohazard Room](http://www.exitgames-stuttgart.de/en/biohazard-room/), and I escaped with 10 minutes to spare! \^_^ They said I was the first person to ever try solving it alone, which was pretty cool.Naturally I won't give away anything about the room, but I will highly recommend it to anyone in this sub. It's much harder than Zero Escape - a real time limit can make it really difficult to think straight! And the puzzles were *tough* - not hopelessly obscure, but Zero Escape rooms are kinda "guided" by comparison.Also, there's some cool design that goes into making puzzles work well for a group of people. Again, I can't explain exactly what's cool about it (no spoilers!), but let's just say it wouldn't just be Junpei doing all the work! 2-6 people seems like a good guideline, but playing alone was definitely a fun challenge. (Next I'll have to try out one of the games back in the US where they have teams of up to 10 people - I can't imagine how that would work at all.)

The possibilities that I can come up with are the Blue Fairy and August, but my objection to them is how could they possibly know every single detail about each character's lives? For example, how could someone possibly know the smallest details of how Prince Charming found Snow White and kissed her if they weren't there. Unless if somehow the book was part of the fairies last minute provisions that the Blue Fairy talked about - somehow extracting everyone's stories and putting it in written form. Or maybe Rumple created it since he knows everything.

I investigated and the Baseband version is Unknown and I can not do anything else with my phone.I have looked everywhere on what to do, but I am not 100% sure and would appreciate some guidance.

I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels the same. Though many people bring up valid points I still think she should acknowledge her sister, I need to see that. Yes, Glenn is Maggie's rock, her everything, the person that will make this whole life worth living. Beth doesn't have that. Beth only had Maggie and her father which is why the past few episodes have been painful for me to watch. Beth is very perceptive and sensitive that somehow she probably knows that Maggie would go after Glenn first, and that just breaks my heart.

I can't really afford to not work so I'm taking up a part-time job at the mall because I have no idea when I'll get offered a position. I went almost a year after graduating college w/o part-time work, I'm scared of that happening again. Another concern is if I do take a part-time job at the mall; I know I don't have to put that on my resume, but in an interview I'll be asked about the gap. Will the hiring individual look down on the fact that I got a part-time job? Also, fyi I was let go from the pt-temp gig 1 month ago.

2ayzel	-58733	1405618584	careerguidance	Accepted low paying job at a university, how do I move up?	TL;DR: Accepted a job in the industry I want to be in (HigherEd), but the pay is $28,000 before taxes. Need advice on how to move up and get more money. I graduated in 2012 from a good school and I started on path in event planning. After about a year of interning and doing part time jobs I finally got a job as a Travel Consultant for Liberty Travel - big mistake. I'm not a sales person at all and I hated working there. So I moved on and continued doing temp and part time gigs in event planning. I thought I wanted to pursue event planning full time because it was an extra curricular I did in college, but I realized I needed something that has more stable hours. By chance a small, private university in my city was hiring a temporary staff member and I was offered the job. During my time there I realized that the place I should be right now is in higher education. When my time there ended I pursued full time positions in various universities and colleges in my surrounding area. Human Resources at the university I was a temp at called me back and told me to come in for an interview for a full time secretary position that was opening up. Good news, I was offered the job and I accepted. Bad news, the pay is only $28,000 before taxes. This is almost unacceptable because of the skills I have, the jobs I've held, and the education I have. I tried negotiating, but the department doesn't have any more funds, however when I was hired HR told me the University as a whole is looking into getting more funding or moving things around so they could give staff members an increase in salary. I decided to take it because 1.) It's exactly in the industry I want to work in and 2.)There is a possibility that I will get a pay increase.  My concern is that, this is a secretary position and I highly doubt that the pay will be any more than $30,000 and I can't start a life this way (I'm 25 years old and hoping to move in with my BF soon). I guess my question is does anyone have any advice on how to move up from a secretary position and get paid what I deserve? I'd love some input from past secretaries and what they did. I don't want to be a secretary in this department forever, I heard that there isn't much student interaction - which is what I want.

The nice thing about wet shaving is the inexpensive consumable prices (compared to purchasing a new cartridge every few weeks?)-but even so I'm pretty tight when it comes to finances. My brother says you can't shove a needle up my ass with a sledgehammer. So-how long does an average DE razor blade last you? One shave? 2? I'm about to embark on finding the perfect blade and these sampler packs are going to provide 50-100 blades. At the rate I'm going now it would take a year to find the right blade!Let me know what y'all think.

Like in America we have this tea company, TAZO, and they have all these flavors like Passion Fruit, Orange Spice, etc.Obviously I have never traveled to the UK or I might have asked someone this already.Edit: Thanks for the info not only on Tea flavors but also on the composition of countries in the UK. I'm glad I can get all this sorted before I travel to the UK and get punched in the face for being ignorant.
2qtzou	-58737	1419961859	Wet_Shavers	Next Day Burn	Does anyone else get the itchy/scratchy redness the day or two after a close shave?I would imagine the solution to prevent this is to shave everyday b/c I've been told the reason this happens is the hair is regrowing and causing the irritation?I have no idea how to correct this but I am experimenting with different blades to see if there is any change in the day after results. This morning I died and went to heaven using the feather for the first time. I am hopeful this is the main issue and that with the right blade I can avoid all irritation.Update: My wife suggested my neck was dry and since it is winter the jacket I wear could be causing irritation. I put some lotion on last night and so far so good! getting ready for another shave now.

I am planning on running all media through Apple TV and Airparrot2 Mirroring technology (for wireless awesomeness).My question to you fine gents is if this system will even work the way I think it should. The setup will be as follows:Computer A/V to Airparrot2 via Cat5 connection or wireless connection for A/V signal (I have 300Mbps down and 30Mbps up wired and 100 down 30 up for wireless)Airparrot A/V to Apple TV Apple Tv Video to Projector VIA HDMIApple Tv Audio to DAC VIA Toslink Optical CableDAC Audio to Receiver VIA RCA CablesReceiver Audio to Speakers VIA Speaker wireDo you guys think this setup will allow me to play movies from my computer to the projector just fine? What issues do you foresee?I plan on installing a CAT5 port in the wall(for computer connection) and a direct cat5 connection from apple TV to the router so if I want to stream 720p (the max I can get from my projector) I shouldn't have a bandwidth issue.Edit: I will only have 2 ceiling speakers so I am not too concerned with more than 2.1 (i think that is the correct term) sound.
2toz9l	-58737	1422249328	AskDocs	Help to ID rash-possible treatments?	My wife is 29 (about to be 30) and is 39 weeks pregnant.This rash appeared on her ear a week ago and started out almost like an infection. The whole ear currently itches. We went to the local dr and got prescribed an oral antibiotic yesterday. She has been putting hydrogen peroxide before she went to the doc(3x a day). We are going to get the AB tomorrow but today tried some topical Benadryl. Essentially, she says if it is just itchy then she can deal with it until it heals naturally (with the help of Benadryl maybe). She's just worried if it might be more serious as it's been a week and seems to be spreading across the ear and other areas are starting to now break out (biceps only for now). I was hoping it had something to do with PUPPPs. If it's any relation she also got a canker sore today. http://i.imgur.com/spgwfxU.jpg

So why (or how) do these tax attornies successfully reduce tax liability. Is it all nepotism?

A bit on me: I am 6'3'' around 290 and have recently gotten into lifting as my jaunts into more cardio based activities have left me bored and looking for something else. I have been doing sl 5x5 for around two months and am really enjoying it. I have put on some muscle and the feel of a pump is almost addictive. I am really enjoying it and seeing results as far as strength goes. My goal now is to lift as much weight as possible, to keep going until I plateau, however I don't want to put on any more fat. So after doing some research and reading into things like lean gains, etc, my question is that if my goal is to end up lifting a ton of weight, am I better off to cycle eating everything in site and putting on mass and then cutting, or to try to just put on mass while cutting fat, I don't know how hard that is to do. Any advice would be appreciated, and sorry for the rambling nature of my post, I am on my phone and in a time crunch.  Edit: I should note that weight is not really a huge issue for me, I am still fairly athletic, have a big frame. If I got down to 235 I would be in great shape.

Has anyone else noticed the trend of engineers and architects pushing more and more expenses onto subcontractors? I have been working for a structural steel fabricator for about a decade now and have noticed Architects are more and more using their drawings as just a guideline. Engineering, calculations, etc. are now being required of us where it used to be done by the AE. Also, on additions, all of the existing conditions are to be "field verified" by the subcontractor prior to approval, this I can understand, but having to confirm sizes and types so that the AE can come up with a design is seemingly stuff that they should be doing. I am still fairly green as far as estimating and project managing goes in the structural steel field, so maybe this is normal, but I needed to vent. Anyone else seeing this?

It seems to me that, although manufacturing jobs are coming back to the U.S. - that it is mostly due to more efficient means of production; requiring large outlays of capital and seemingly less and less actual people needed for labor. I am just curious if we will be forced into a more socialized society as our way of life becomes more easy to attain through less and less actual labor.  It just seems that if government doesn't help out, the middle class will erode and we will just have an ultra wealthy upper class and the have nots.

I really want to enjoy the game and it looks to have the potential.  TLDR at the bottom.Anyway, I have played 26 hours of X3:TC since I bought it about 2 years ago. I always wanted to play seriously but could never bring myself to (always end up cheating and spawning things and watch them blow stuff up). I love mods so I downloaded quite a few every time I play to enhance things. However, EVERY time I just can't play it seriously. I get really bored with the campaigns so I never stick with them, instead I just jump into the sandbox mode and try different things to see if I could find something I like.After awhile I figured that the main goal I wanted to do was to build an empire, build giant fleets and fight the in-game "races" and take over their territory one by one. However without a large source of income this obviously isn't possible and from what I know comes from trading, building factories (which I like), etc. However, this is where I run into my problem:  * It takes a really long time.  Which is fine by me, because if it were super easy then i'd be just as bored. However, most of the time spent I find myself in SETA doing literally nothing while I wait for my ai ships to do their thing. I could run missions but in my opinion I don't really enjoy them because I feel it simply extends the time I have to wait vs waiting in SETA. Which also brings me to my other problem, I can't do ANYTHING other then float in space/fly in autopilot in SETA. I can't Alt-tab to watch a movie or stream, I can't bring up menus to check up on my ships, nothing or else it would cancel the SETA. If I want it to run I would have to just sit there staring into nothing.  I **really** want to enjoy this game but I guess I don't know how because in the end I just end up using the cheat package to spawn me a megafleet and stations and go destroy things before I get bored and uninstall the game (then reinstall because I want to do a legitimate play-through and then the process repeats lol).I've played space-sims before like Freelance and currently I actively play EVE Online which I really enjoy.    **TLDR;** I want to build an empire, however what should I do to make the "rise" to building an empire more enjoyable?

I'm debating which one I could buy after watching and reading up information about them and I can't really come to a conclusion. They seem to do the same thing so it might be redundant to have them both. I have tried the Quixel Suite Trial and it feels more like a Photoshop plugin which is fine but It just feels a little awkward for me to use.  I have never tried Substance Designer (going to get the trial soon), so I was wondering if that was any better.

The website/wiki doesn't seem to have an easy way for me to see the changes aside from numerous change logs so I hope its okay if I ask here.  When I played you mostly were able to build ships, some stuff on the planets, and there were pirates that were OP until you build a ship that was finally able to kill them. When I played I believed they had *just* added in multi-ship docking (ships can dock on to ships with docks I believe).  So far from the few posts I see on my frontpage I see he added shadows (yay graphics!), warping, and that's mostly all I got. Is there a crafting system? or has the ai pirates been updated at all? Anything major to the gameplay?

3bwo4o	-58744	1435865880	buildapc	[Build Help] I'm a 3D artist looking into building a computer dedicated to rendering scenes.	**Background info:**  As the title says, i'm a 3D artist in the U.S that is interested in rendering 3D scenes. I was hoping to get some advice from other people that have experience with rendering scenes/building render farms.  I already have a main computer that I mainly do all my work/play games on. I'm interested in building a separate computer on a network so I can offload all the rendering processes onto, like a render farm. From some of the research I've done I should mostly be looking into something with more CPU, and since I won't really need to do anything on it I probably won't need a graphics card.  I want to say my budget is around $600, I can stretch that up to $800 but would prefer not to.**So my main questions are:**- On my budget, is it even worth bothering with making a dedicated rendering PC (would the render time be significantly improved)?- Do I need a graphics card for this build? I *think* rendering mostly uses CPU from what I've researched.- I have little knowledge when it comes to networks and such. Would I be alright with just hooking up an Ethernet cable to my modem/router, or would I need (or would it be more efficient) to add something to the network setup?- I think the processor will probably be the most important component. Would an i5 be alright? Are the Xeon series/i7 be worth the price increase for their amount of performance in rendering?- How much Ram is recommended for this kind of thing?- Could I get away with fitting this all into a small case without worrying about temperature issues?**Additional info:**  I use 3ds-MAX and v-Ray for rendering. I don't really do animation, im more into rendering static CG scenes.  This is the main PC that I do Work/Game on:Type|Item:----|:----|:----**CPU** | [Intel Core i7-3820 3.6GHz Quad-Core Processor](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80619i73820) **Motherboard** | [EVGA X79 Dark EATX LGA2011 Motherboard](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-motherboard-150see789k2)**Video Card** | [EVGA GeForce GTX 660 2GB Video Card](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-video-card-02gp42662kr)

Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.** - I'm a 3D artist. I would use this computer for offloading the rendering processes (which is very processor intensive). I alreayd have a main work computer, this one will be a secondary computer sitting in my room hooked up as a server. I mainly use 3DS Max with V-ray for rendering. I don't do animations, just static scenes.  If its possible I could also try to use it as a server for modded minecraft (feed the beast)/ Arma 3 (both are very RAM intensive).&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** * $600 I can stretch it up to $650 if its worth it. Please try to use the amount **before** Mail-in-Rebate.&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** * More than two weeks from now, probably next month.&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** * All the things needed to run a barebones computer without a graphics card.&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** * I am located in the U.S (Ohio). I have access to Microcenter.&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** * I can reuse most of my previous peripherals. I don't really need to do anything on it as it'll just be sitting there hooked into the network. I have spare monitors and keyboards to do any management or installation on it as required.&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** * No. I need it to be as cool as possible.&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)*** HDD doesn't need to be large, 120GB is fine.&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?*** Preferably something small, I want it to take up little room. A Micro ATX would be fine with me if it also has room for extra HDD's.&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?*** Do not include an OS in the budget :)&gt;**Extra info or particulars:*** I may also use the computer as extra storage space later on down the road so any case and motherboard that gives me the option to add additional HDD/SSD's later on down the road would be great (though this isn't necessary, compactness takes priority). A graphics card is NOT required as I will only need the computer for its raw processing power. I would like it to be as compact as possible but not small enough that airflow/temperature would be an issue. If you know any quiet aftermarket coolers that can fit onto the CPU/Case don't be afraid to include it into the build (I won't be overclocking, but I do need it to be quiet if the stock fan isn't good enough).

I'm with Binary Titans and we're going on pretty strong.  So where is everyone else at? I barely see any other group aside from maybe one or two that even bother with the progress mondays anymore. Do other groups still exist, but only lurk on the subreddit?  I'm asking because I'm curious as to what happened to the drones of people that first signed up at the beginning. I'm also curious as to what happened to groups that fell apart, what was the reason?  If there are people that have signed up and lost/haven't found a group but are still interested maybe we could do something to help them out?

I mostly use it for 3D art (3DS Max, Photoshop, other software), gaming, and gamedev. Also, for the past year or so my computer occasionally crashes while I'm playing games. I've watched the temps and my GPU never goes higher than 60C and CPU stays around 55C. It doesn't blue screen or anything, one monitor goes out, whole computer freezes (can't move mouse, alt tab, etc), but I can still hear my friends talking on Teamspeak. It doesn't goto bluescreen or restart unless I manually power the PC off. Would anyone know what would cause this?

Thanks for taking the time to read my post!
3genx7	-58744	1439166720	GameDev1	Subreddit update! We have decided on some changes/additions to the rules and structure of the subreddit.	Hello everyone, I'm Ace0fspad3s and if you've browsed this subreddit the last few weeks I'm sure you've seen my name popped up every now and then. Some of the old moderators has left or stepped down from the subreddit due to other interests and real-life related matters. I really like the group of people we have here and really enjoyed the energy we had on this sub in the first few weeks. So in their absence, I've asked if I could manage the subreddit and so here we are.This is going to be a very long post, so first of all I want to say thank you to everyone that is still here. I know we've had a rough start but I'm glad you're reading this right now. Thank you for everyone that took the survey two weeks ago, it really helped me out.**TLDR;**- We'll be running a repeating game-jam on the sub- Deadline is now every 30 days (we have a small intermission period in-between each round)- Groups must have their project manager report in to us- People need to tell their PM if they cannot work in their group anymore- We'll have a public list of all groups that are participating so if they lose/need people then its easier for them to continue rather than just fall apart b/c of one missing person.Before I begin, I want to say that this post is merely explaining the thought process behind the decisions and therefore I won't be listing/discussing all individual rules and guidelines we've added. Before you continue reading, click on the link below:#[Please read the subreddit's wiki for all the detailed rules and guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameDev1/wiki/index). (it is also linked in the sidebar).It is mostly a semi-final draft of what it will look like because I want to hear thoughts and opinions from the community first and take into consideration of any feedback I get about how this subreddit is going to work. To begin, there wasn't really an official "purpose" of this subreddit other than for organizational reasons until now. This sub was kind of just a improvised, but I think we can turn it into something more. /r/gamedev (the sub that this one spawned from) is more of general game development discussion. We've decided that this subreddit will become a place aimed for helping new/inexperienced game developers or anyone that wants to work in any aspect of the video game industry. We're not excluding anyone that has a lot of experience in the video game industry, in fact its quite the opposite where it would be beneficial to have people with that kind of experience around. Its kind of like what /r/learnprogramming is to /r/programming. Though I feel like the structure is closer to /r/dailyprogrammer. If I could change the subreddit name to /r/N00bGameDev then I would :P.---#Game-JamThis brings us to our first point. We're sticking to the idea of having people learn gamedev by having them, well....make video games. And to achieve that, we're going to have the subreddit become a monthly game-jam aimed for novices (we'll call it the /r/GameDev1 N00bDev Game-Jam). Now a month is a very short time to make a video game, especially for people inexperienced with game development. Developing video games is **hard**. Some groups collapsed simply because they took on a project way out of their scope. The idea of having a month long game jam is to encourage people to not tackle full on video games, but rather small projects that can be realistically developed in such a small time frame. The month long deadline gives people a short-term goal so its easier to commit to. We want people to learn and hone their skills on a smaller scale, in an environment with like-minded people. Because of that, we decided on this rule for the subreddit:* This is no longer a place to post **project proposals** about **long term projects**.The reason being is because we want newcomers to focus on learning and understanding the foundations of game development and working in a team. We understand that some people **do** want to work on full fledged games and that is fine, however /r/gameDevClassifieds may be better place for that. With that said, if any team finds that they DO want to take their game and turn it into something long-term, that is fine by us, however it will not qualify for the next jam (but feel free to post about it). It is also fine to talk about or post about a long-term project you or your team is working on. You just simply cannot post a **project proposal** about something not intended for the game-jam.The next big change are project managers. The main causes of groups disbanding were: * Lack of communication* Talent leaving the team mid-projectWe're not pointing fingers at anyone but we're going to be a little more strict on how groups are managed. While everyone in their group is responsible for communication, the project manager is where the responsibility will lie. We need to ensure constant communication between group members and the role that handles that most is supposed to be a project manager. If the group is failing to communicate, then you need to step out and do your best to get them to do so. If there are any severe issues with members not communicating, we're always here to help and we need the project managers to reach out to us to work out a solution, most likely finding and placing another person in the group.  Sometimes people just fall off the face of the world and just stop communicating with other project members. We understand that real-life takes priority and sometimes you suddenly cannot commit to the project any longer. If this situation happens, you are to notify your project manager as early as possible so your group can arrange to have someone else in your place. If you fail to do so, you will be suspended from further N00bDev game-jams.  Lastly, which is how we're going to organize all the projects before and during every round each month's jam.  Before/during each round, we'll have a sticky on the sub with a list of all participating projects for the round. When someone makes a project proposal, they are to send the mods a message with a link to the post so we can add the project to the list. This will make it easier for people that are looking for projects to join, as well as helping projects find talent. This list will be active throughout the entire round, and updated throughout (we'll also have this info in the sidebar). If your group loses a member, the project manager should contact us so we can update the list to state that your project is looking for talent. This potentially enables anyone that didn't find a group at first or missed the group-formation stage to participate.I didn't write this in the wiki yet, but we're also going to allow anyone that doesn't want to be in a team to participate in the jam as well if they prefer to fly solo. All you have to do is make a similar post to a project proposal (tell us about the game you want to make) but state that it'll just be a solo project. Send us a message once you've posted and you'll be treated as if you were a group. Do know that this also means you are also responsible for reporting in every week as well. ---#Subreddit OrganizationWith that said, we're still working on a way to figure out a system to easily allow everyone to enter their information into a database. One idea was to have an entire website built for it. If someone wants to volunteer to help us accomplish building some kind of system for managing all the participants, please send us a PM or comment below!  We're also looking for someone who wants to develop the subreddit's CSS.We hope this will help keep groups active throughout development, and thus letting people make games. Understand that the game you want to make, may not be the one you **can** make (yet). The idea here is to help you build the skills to enable you to get comfortable with developing video games and working in a team. Thanks for reading, please comment below for any questions and concerns. We're still very open to suggestions and I can clarify anything that isn't understood about how things are going to work in the future.EDIT: added the TLDR;EDIT: some grammar

3i0i8v	-58744	1440280360	GameDev1	Information on how to participate in the /r/GameDev1 n00bDev Jam Round 1!	#/r/GameDev1 n00bDev GameJam Round 1 begins Sat. Aug 29, and ends Mon, Sept 21, 2015!Hello everyone! We are now going to get the ball rolling on our first n00bDev Game Jam! A 30-day game jam designed for novices, and people that want to meet/learn with other aspiring gamedevs! You do NOT need to be a novice in gamedev to participate. We ask those with more experience to go around and help out groups with little experience.  This is the intermission phase where we let people find groups and plan/design their games for the jam! We have an [IRC](https://client01.chat.mibbit.com/?channel=%23GameDev1&amp;server=irc.eu.mibbit.net) channel everyone can use.You can find more information about the Game Jam and the subreddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameDev1/comments/3genx7/subreddit_update_we_have_decided_on_some/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameDev1/wiki/index/rulesguidelines) ---Anyone that is interested in participating (solo and in a group), please fill out the [skill sheet form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/151laMLzBiHLdFuUZmp8JLReGsy6RXEb_bBVdtNyrqV4/viewform)-It should only take 1-2 minutes if not less to fill out the form.This lets us re-organize groups that lost/need members. And lets project managers review the skillset of their group.If you wish to participate you can either:If you have a game idea:* Create a project proposal post/thread ([here is the template](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameDev1/wiki/index/projectposttemplate))If you want to just work with others:* Look for project posts on the subreddit (or the [masterlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameDev1/comments/3i0iww/group_and_projects_masterlist_for_n00bdev_jam/)) and join an existing groupIf you want to enter solo:* You don't have to do anything special. Just submit the game **on or before the final date** (details on submissions will be available soon)If you have a closed/private group (like entering with just friends):* You'll be treated the same as a solo. You do not have to report in, or make a project post. Just submit the game on or before the final date.You can find the template for making a project proposal post here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/GameDev1/wiki/index/projectposttemplate, and in the sidebar.**Once you make a project post, please message the mods with the link or comment in the stickied master list thread!** You can also flair your post for better visibility.edit: for clarification, If you do not make a group or go solo, you must FIND a group to join. The skill sheet is for mods to re-organize groups later on down the road in the event of a loss member. It also lets us ensure that all groups at least have at least a basic skill level, rather than everyone starting from scratch. If your group has atleast 2 members that know how to program, then you should be fine.---Popular forms of communication are:  [Skype](http://www.skype.com/en/)  [Google Hangouts](https://plus.google.com/hangouts)[Slack](https://slack.com/)Group organization tools:[Slack](https://slack.com/)[Trello](https://trello.com/)---Your final submission should be a playable build, doesn't matter how long or finished. If your group could not make a playable build you can always just post screenshots or a video of what you have.We are hoping to make this process easier, and a system is currently in development to help automate a lot of the process.Also, I'm looking for someone to work on the subreddit's CSS style. Anyone that has experience with that and doesn't mind volunteering, send a mod message!Thanks for showing your interest! I'm excited to see what people will come up with! ---Please comment below for any questions or concerns regarding the format!

3i105b	-58744	1440289503	gamedev	Hello! Let me tell you about our subreddit where we run a Game Jam aimed at novices!	Hello /r/GameDev! I'm a moderator over at /r/GameDev1.  First I want to say that we are **not affiliated** with /r/gamedev or its mods here as both subreddits have different purposes (/r/gamedev1 is more about helping novice gamedevs). The subreddit wasn't intended to be permanent so the subreddit creator didn't think of an actual name. Trust me, if I could change it I would :3.With that said, we are about to begin the first round of /r/Gamedev1's n00bDev GameJam next week (Aug 29th). The n00bDev Jam encourages people to work together in groups.It is a 30-day long gamejam that is planned to repeat every month. The main reason why the gamejam is so long compared to others is so novice gamedevs have the time to learn, and the group structure leaves time for people to communicate.We have just did a large overhaul of the structure of the gamejam/subreddit, so we ended up losing a lot of users do to inactivity. The new structure is young, so rules and format may be changed in later rounds depending on the feedback we get and we're pretty open to ideas!You can read more about the jam and the [subreddit here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameDev1/wiki/index).---Thanks for taking the time to read this post and I'll be happy to answer any questions in the comments!
3i8s6e	-58744	1440447093	GameDev1	Project Proposal - 3D Galaga Remake in Unity	#Galaga CloneAs the title suggests, this project is going to make a  [Galaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga) clone in 3D with Unity.What positions do you believe are needed for this game:* 3D artist* 1-2 Programmers* Audio designer/composerDescribe the game and its design in detail:For those of you who are familiar with Galaga, no explanation would be needed. Galaga is a classic game from the 1980's where the player controls a spaceship at the bottom of the screen. Enemies enter the screen from the top and the player must eliminate the enemy spaceships before they kill him.  We're doing a 3D remake (or atleast something similar) of the game in Unity that uses 3d models but the top-down game play will be mostly the same as the original (we may expand with our own features if we have time). The project may be "watered down" depending on how smooth everything goes, but our main objective is to create a working product above all else.We chose this project because there is a handful of documentation online on how to make this game on Unity, and we are confident that we can make a working build within the time-frame with even with just the two of us alone (me and /u/pcast01).What positions are currently filled:* Project manager - Me  * Lead 3D artist - Me  * Lead Programmer - /u/pcast01  * Programmer - /u/149244179* 3d artist - /u/QuadroMan1What positions are currently needed:~~1 additional Programmer~~  * Audio Designer/Composer* Apprentice programmer for someone that is new with programming(see below) to help out on some smaller stuff.I'm very easy to get a hold of, I'm most active between:10 am - 10 pm U.S EST *(-4 GMT)*Just comment below or send a PM.---Additional information or notes:  The version control we use is Git. If you don't understand how to use Git then you'll learn how to use that as well.We feel like we can tackle this project pretty confidently so we're also going to extend our group to adding on some novices that has never worked with a game engine or made a game before.  If you're very new to programming or 3D art, or want to learn those skills we can take you on as apprentices so you can learn and help out on small tasks on this project. However, we still do ask that you have a basic understanding of these things: Apprentice Programmer: You must understand the following concepts:* Understand basic syntax and variable/data types.* Be able to write loops (for loops, while loops, etc.) * If statementsWe'll mainly be writing in C# so any previous experience with C#, java, or any other object-oriented language is preferred.  Apprentice 3D Artist:* Understand how to use a 3D program such as Blender, 3DS Max, Maya, or Modo.* Understand how to UV map objects* Have a basic understanding of Photoshop OR a texturing suite (such as Substance Designer or 3D coat) I have 2 years of dedicated experience in hardsurface modelling, so I can confidently teach an apprentice 3D Artist: * Creating optimal hard-surface game assets* Highpoly to lowpoly modelling workflow for unity* Making sure your UV's are sensible so a texture artist doesn't kick you in the nuts.* Baking Normal maps from a highpoly to lowpoly model* Working with Physically Based Rendering for Unity (importing, setting up the material, etc.)I may also go over some other things if asked but I only consider myself *decent*, so no promises. If you're a 3D artist and already understands the above (or is a character artist) then you most likely won't learn anything from me (hey, I'm learning too D: ).---Our group mainly uses Google hangouts to communicate. We also will hold a meeting at the beginning (or before) the jam so make sure you are available for one during the first or second week (usually on the weekend, like a Sunday). Thanks for reading! If you're interested or have any questions, leave a comment.

3iceex	-58744	1440516773	GameDev1	Haven't found a Team/Project yet? Post here.	We have 4 days until the jam starts. There are plenty of people out there that has still not found a group that may be looking. A majority of those people are programmers.  If you have not found a group, comment here with a brief summary of your skillset. You will not be automatically placed in a team, but this thread will allow everyone that is still looking for a team to see and talk to each other. If you want to participate in the jam with a group but have not found one, it is probably ideal that you find some people here or on IRC and form one.  ---Remember that you can still join groups even during the jam, as sometimes teams may lose members and thus there can be openings mid-jam if you could not find a team at start.

3iwg5n	-58744	1440892179	GameDev1	N00bDev1 GameJam has officially started! Information on submissions and other stuff.	#The final submission deadline is Mon. Sept. 21 2015!Hello everyone! Thanks for participating in the N00bDev Gamejam Round1. Just trying to get out some information on what will happen during and towards the end of the jam.------###During the jam:- If you still are unfortunately unable to find a group for the gamejam, this doesn't mean you still cannot enter. You are still able to join or form your own groups freely. You can always opt to enter solo.   Be sure to check the masterlist about once or twice a week as it may be updated as new projects might pop up, or some of the teams may need help if they lose/need a new member.- Every Monday, Automoderator will post on the subreddit a "Weekly Progress" thread. All project managers (or if for some reasons another representative) must comment in this thread with a short (or detailed) update on their team.Even if your team didn't make very much progress, you should be able to tell us something. Talk about what your team has accomplished, working on, any issues you're running into, what is taking longer than expected, etc. are all acceptable and encouraged.   Anyone else like soloists or private groups may post here too but it is optional.Make sure you begin the post with your group/game's name.  Screenshots, GIFs, and/or a video included in the comment is highly encouraged, but not required.---**Example:**  Hot dog 2D shooter:  We got the basic movement working, and are currently working on the ai and ui elements. We're running into a little bit of trouble like the ai running into walls and stuff. Our sound designer is going to be away for a few days but he said he'll be working on the weapon sounds and sound effects. Our group made cupcakes together over skype as well.  ---* **Important:** If for whatever reason you cannot commit to the project any longer, **you are to inform your project manager** as soon as possible.Sometimes things happen. We understand that sometimes real life gets in the way, or maybe you're just burned out or realized that this isn't for you. However, this also creates an issue for your group who may still want to continue as they now have an open position and sometimes the remaining group members cannot perform that role. You are to let your manager know so he can look for someone else to replace you, as there are still a good handful of people that haven't found a group and would probably be willing to take the spot. With that said, Project managers, it is also you duty to ensure that you let the mods know that you have a position open so we can help you find someone to fill in the open position. That is one of the reasons the skill sheet exists. * Project managers, if you no longer wish to be a project manager, let someone else in your group take the role.  For reasons, the same as above.------###Submissions:  A submissions thread will open 3 days before the deadline, for anyone that has finished their project before the deadline.Submissions for the Gamejam are games that are atleast in a basic working condition. Ensure your submission can be played in either of these formats:  * Playable in the browser* Playable via downloadWe don't have a dedicated website so you'll have find a place host your game. If someone knows of some good places that'll let people host their games in the browser for free that'll be awesome and I'll edit this post/update the wiki. If your game needs to be downloaded, your game must be pre-compiled and make sure to include all files to allow the game the run. Try to reduce the amount of dependencies for your game as much as possible. It would be very inconvenient to have the user download various other files in order to run your game. Try to keep the filesize as low as possible, &gt;200MB would be preferred.  Be sure to include screenshots/gifs of your game to get people excited about it!This gamejam is non-competitive, as it is to encourage learning. That means there will be no scoring or judging of final submissions.  If your group is interested in taking your game to a larger project or even with a commercial goal, you are free to. However, just remember that the game is not eligible as a N00bDev GameJam submission for any other round. Though you are allowed to post about your game on the subreddit.---### After the Jam: After the jam is done, we'll once again enter another week intermission phase to let people find/create groups for Round 2. I'll also have a survey at the end, because I'm always looking to improve the format. The format will most likely be the same, but might be changed depending on the feedback I get.  We're also working on a website/system to let people find/create groups easier without all the messy posting around. However, this may or may not be completed by Round 2. Lastly, I want to say that **Round 2 will be the last one of this year.** We'll be taking a break after round 2, with Round 3 opening toward the end of January 2016 or early February. However, if there is enough demand for round 3 to be sooner, we'll have round 3 in November-Dec. I'm the most active moderator on this subreddit so it gets a little tiring running around managing as much as I can, so if there is a round 3 most likely I'm going to need some help with that.---###Additional notes:  I want to address the reasoning behind having project managers, and having them report in every week. The long story is below but I'll provide the short summary here:  Working in an online group with 6 strangers for a project can be difficult to maintain. A month is a fairly long time for a jam, and would usually require you to devote a decent amount of your free time each week. Some people handle it better than others. We have these rules because it lets us know when participants realize they cannot commit to such a time. We can't force you to commit to your project but what we can do is make it easier for the group to continue if you decide to back out. Project managers lets us keep in touch with all the groups and lets us communicate and do our best to solve these problems.  This is why we don't require soloists or private groups to report in, as their group environment would be more stable, and thus wouldn't need our assistance.I want to conclude this post with a couple of closing notes from some past experiences **(the long version)**:  A majority of the people here are fairly inexperienced with actual game development. To add onto that, we're all working in a group, mostly with other strangers. When you have an online group held together by something that the group members are unsure and inexperienced about, it gets messy. Committing to a month long project using whatever free time you decide to devote, can be a difficult thing to do. Add onto that the group will most likely need all 6 people top commit for such a time also makes it more difficult, especially since there is no monetary gain. I know class is starting again this month for those of us that is attending school, and there are also plenty of people who have full-time jobs or even families they need to tend to. Before this game jam, this sub was originally intended as a meet-up for some people from /r/gamedev. Everyone (much like you guys) had the technical ability, but haven't had much experience in game development. We all broke into around 12 groups into a format similar to this gamejam. However, the main difference was that the games were all intended to be hobby projects to which each group decided the fate of their game. We had only one deadline, which was to submit a working prototype of the game after 2 months of development. Before the 2 months even was near, the sub went quiet and progress reports were nil. By the time the deadline for a prototype was reached, only 2 groups managed to post something. What those 2 groups produced is what I'm sure isn't even close to what they had in mind. I was a member of one of those 2 teams. I created a survey to find what happened to the groups and these were my results:  * Most groups failed at week 3 and 4 after development began. A good handful failed only after 2. * The main factor contributing to group failure was a member going dark, and the group could not establish communication with the member, and thus development could not continue.* Members simply stopped communicated altogether after about week 2 or it had died down considerably after development began. At some points people didn't even understand what features were in the game or what was needed to be done.  After reviewing the skill sheet (of the old groups), everyone seemed capable of developing a video game. However, not everyone was capable with **working in a group**.  You can still see all of the old posts and projects people wanted to tackle from two months ago.  With that said, my best advice is for people to constantly keep in touch with your peers in your groups. Let others know what you're working on. Even if you can't do something or was unable to make any progress, don't be afraid to talk to your group about it. One of the main reasons why I felt like my group was able to keep together was that we constantly told each other things and updated everyone on what was going on. Even if one of us had to go away for a week, or couldn't work on the game, he let us know. When you say these things, it lets people know: A.) You're aliveB.) you're still interested in working on the project.C.) What you're working on (ties into B)**Learning is the goal**, always keep that in mind. Even if you weren't able to create or develop what you wanted, what you got of attempting is what is important. I'm a 3D artist. The last project I worked on I felt like I could've done better. I could've been faster, it could've looked better, etc. But I learned so much just from working on something, even if it didn't turn out the way I wanted to. I never even touched Unity until 2 months ago. I'm now learning how to write shaders for it.Always remember that this sub, and this gamejam has the goal of letting aspiring gamedevs learn. It isn't about making your dream game, it is about learning the tools and methods in order to do so. You will fail, and you will get stuck a lot. But that is okay. When you work with like minded people, it makes it easier to fail because you're not alone and can even ask for help. Even if no one in the group knows you can always ask on the sub and I'm sure someone could help you. ------Thank you for participating in this jam! I look forward to seeing what everyone makes for the gamejam! If you have any questions or anything you feel would be useful for me to add to the post, let me know below!

As sole executor does my mother have to gain consent from her brother to sell his half interest or can she express her executor rights and make a reasonable decision without his consent?

In the "courtship phase", it seems to me like most girls my age (mid 20s) expect the guy to do 95% of the work and it's tiring.But maybe, that girl in particular isn't into me but then: why the fuck does she keep inviting me to another salsa party each time ? I don't know. And the interactions with her are really awkward (not because I'm hitting on her or anything. It just is. Probably because of me. The use of a second language for both of us and the loud environment makes it hard to communicate). Maybe it's just because I'm a decent dancer and she likes to dance with me but that is all she wants from me. Yeah, I suppose that's it. Fuck this, my brain is melting. I'm done.She left the country now anyway. Maybe i should have asked her what the fuck she wanted from me (great way to start a conversation isn't it? ahah). That girl is so fucking cute (amongst other things) and being friend with her would have been cool too (though let's not kid ourselves, I haven't felt this way about a girl since a long time) but i really have no idea on how to communicate with her. Maybe I should have left her alone and moved on sooner.God damn, social skills are hard. And I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me.Sorry the rambling and thank you for reading.

18u236	-58791	1361302107	buildapc	Considering building a desktop after using laptops almost exclusively, could use advice	Greetings, Reddit.My 5-or-so-year-old laptop's hard drive seems to have worn out after years of heavy and constant use (trying to access certain things hangs the OS and causes the drive to go silent), and this leaves me with a few options. I'm not worried about data loss since I regularly back up everything (and the HDD even still works enough to salvage quite a bit).Obviously the cheapest solution is to replace the hard drive. As far as I can tell, no other hardware in the laptop is having a problem. I'd want to do a clean install since after those years the OS became a bit of a mess. Without spending extra money, this means I'd have to reinstall the copy of Windows XP it came with. Problem is, that's a lot of work to reinstall and reconfigure everything for an OS that I've really been wanting to upgrade by now.So that means I could buy Win7 (64-bit). But that's fairly expensive (at least for my liking), and by the time I add up the HDD, the OS, and the time it would take to get everything back to where I'm comfortable, I might as well just get a new computer now and replace the aging laptop.I'm hesitant to do that, since like I said, it's only really the HDD that has a problem. The laptop's a Dell Inspiron 1520 (I know, I know), has 4 gigs of DDR2 ram (which has worked well enough), a core 2 duo, and an Nvidia card that was fairly decent for a laptop at the time (circa-2007).I already have a small tablet/laptop that can suffice for most small mobile work (I've found that I never liked lugging around my main laptop). So a desktop instead sounds like it would make a lot of sense, and be far cheaper while being more capable. It'd be less likely to fail by simple virtue of not being carried around to places. However, I've never built a PC before (and I'm reluctant to buy a pre-built one).**-------tldr-------**I suppose I'd just like some suggestions or advice if anyone has any.--Would it really make sense to only replace the laptop's dead hard drive and see how long I can keep trucking with WinXP?--Should I buy a hard drive and Win7 for the aging laptop? --Should I buy a new laptop? --Should I buy a pre-built desktop?--Should I build a desktop PC from scratch?I'm on a pretty tight budget and would rather not approach $400-500 (US) if I can help it. I do game, but not often on high settings, and to be honest, I don't find myself running modern games all that much (I like buying indie games or games from GOG). I mainly need it for things like Adobe products (especially Flash or After Effects). I've already got things like a keyboard, mouse, and monitor, so that's not a problem. I'm not very well-versed in building (or buying) PCs, so I'd appreciate any advice. Apologies on the flood of text, I'm new to Reddit as well.
191j5a	-58791	1361566530	buildapc	[Help] Question about adding to pre-built PC	Hi all,Since I'm pretty clueless when it comes to picking compatible (and worthwhile) PC parts, and I really need a new PC as soon as possible so I don't have a ton of time to spend researching, I was thinking of caving and just getting a pre-built PC (I know, I know).I just need something better than my five-year-old laptop that can run Adobe Creative Suite software pretty well (especially Flash and After Effects). I play games, but not *too* often on a PC, and usually they aren't modern, and I'm used to playing at lower resolutions and/or at lower settings. That won't bother me too much.Specifically, I was looking at this Gateway one:http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883113194The specs are as follows:AMD 64 bit Quad-Core A8-3820 2.5GHz, 4MB L2 Cache6GB DDR3 (4 slots, 16 GB total)1TB SATA HDDAMD Radeon HD 6550D Graphics (APU)AMD A75 chipsetIntegrated audio (don't care much about great audio)Tons of USB ports, VGA and HDMI out, audio ports, card readers, etc.Expansion: External Bays    (0/1) 3.5"HDD    (0/1) 5.25" ODDPCI Slots (Available/Total)    (1/1) PCI-E x16    (0/1) PCI-E x1-------My question is this: Most of that looks pretty good (not too sure about the processor, but it's better than what I had for sure). All of that would probably total up to about the same price if I had bought all the parts on my own.What I want to know is if I'm not happy with the APU's performance, would it be possible to stick a different dedicated graphics card in there? How about the processor for that matter? I'm not familiar with the motherboard or the case they use, so I'm not sure if it's very expandable.

EDIT: Thanks to comments from here and r/buildapc, I've got plenty of available options to try, the "worst" being that I'll just have a go at a Linux distribution and use WINE. Thanks a bunch everyone!--------Wasn't really sure what category of PC subreddits this fell under, so I apologize in advance if this isn't really "technical support" material. It's more for advice.I have a laptop that used to be my main PC (a Dell Inspiron 1520, a number of years old now), and its hard drive began to fail to the point where it couldn't properly boot into Windows without stalling on the desktop. I know it's the hard drive because the read/write speed has felt generally slower and slower in the months before it died, and it stalls with a very consistent and distinct clicking sound-- However, I can still access my files with a Linux boot disc, leading me to believe that it's either a worn-out part of the hard drive Windows was installed on, or some corruption therein. Either way I can still access files with a boot disc and it was all backed up to begin with, so nothing was lost.I decided to say "screw it" and bought a cheap (but decent-for-a-prebuilt) desktop to use as my main PC. I also wanted to use Windows 7 (the laptop was still on XP in 2013, and Windows 8 wasn't quite fixed up yet).My laptop still functions perfectly well, however, and it's just the hard drive that needs replacing and it'd be good as new for probably a while longer. My question is this: Since I don't have a proper install disc or key for Windows (it didn't come with either), and I'm installing a completely clean drive, should I go with a Linux distribution (Ubuntu, Mint, some variation thereof, etc.) or buy a copy of Windows?The context is that I have absolutely no experience with Linux beyond using it as a boot disc in emergencies, while I'm quite comfortable with and fond of Windows despite its own issues. I'd love to learn how to use Linux (I pick up software fairly quickly), but I would lose a great number of programs I use regularly on Windows (Adobe Flash, smaller Windows-specific programs, etc.). However, to buy Windows, it costs a hell of a lot for an operating system that came with my computers (near a hundred bucks for Win7 OEM still!), and Linux is, of course, free. That would be on top of what I have to pay for the drive.Again, this is my secondary computer, so it won't see as much use anymore as my main PC, but it'd be nice to get working again instead of it going to waste. Anyone have any advice (or alternatively, at the very least, a legal way to transfer the operating system license somehow between drives)? Thanks in advance!**tl;dr: Replacing hard drive in my secondary laptop, don't know what OS to install on it. I don't know anything about Linux, I use programs specific to Windows, but Windows is expensive to buy a license for even at the basest level.**

Hi all,I've dabbled in ActionScript for years but am not all that good at it, and most of the time it's just figuring out how to go about something.Right now I'm interested in making some code that can break apart and format text by taking cues from control codes in the text. I.e., I would have a line look something like:&gt;&lt;PLAYERNAME&gt;, it's about time we head &lt;ORANGE&gt;somewhere else&lt;BLACK&gt;.What I want is for the formatting and cues for the text output to be in the script itself (probably in an XML file or something similar), so that the code itself is really flexible and it's easy to modify the dialogue separately later. Anyone have any good ideas as to how I could go about this? I've been fooling around with regular expressions and throwing arrays together and such, and I can't quite get the hang of making it do what I want without being overly complicated. Ideally, the text would have the features applied to it as it reaches the control codes, so the displayed text could be controlled via the dialogue itself instead of baking in all the individual lines in the code.If you don't have an idea of what I'm going for, [here's a good post with examples of what such things are](http://legendsoflocalization.com/an-inside-look-at-video-game-control-codes/).**tl;dr: I'm looking for a nudge in the right direction to creating text that formats itself according to control codes in the string itself.**

I was just about to order a cradle for the [New XL](http://images.eurogamer.net/2014/usgamer/New-3DS-Screenshot-08.jpg), but quickly remembered that I also have on order the [Hori clear plastic shells](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QvX1XJ6rL.jpg), which would obviously make it too big for the cradle.Does anyone that has one of these cradles (I'm sure the standard size is the same as the XL) recommend them or have any feedback about them? I'm going to assume that the protectors are probably more worth having (for my Majora XL) than the cradle. Although I'm mildly curious if the new cradles are better than the old ones (my OG 3DS is finicky about hitting the charging contacts properly without messing with it).**tl;dr: New N3DSXL Charging cradle or protective shells?**

I've played Jak &amp; Daxter, Daxter (PSP), and Jak 2 now.The thing is, I liked Jak 1, but didn't like Jak 2 at all. Should I give Jak 3 a shot? How does it compare to 2? I know they made it less frustrating than 2; is there anything else worth knowing? Specifically, the driving in Jak 2 was tedious, and I'm curious if that improves at all in 3.
2wmvxk	-58791	1424501396	3DS	I got my MM N3DSXL, no problems so far	Being a bit facetious, but with the amount of people (myself included) that were nervous after reading all the various defects people reported, and were all met with "no one ever posts about their system working fine", I figured I'd do just that.Granted, I've only had it for a day. But so far so good, and the system transfer was mercifully successful. I did very slightly scuff the prongs on the back plate where you remove them (seriously, doing that sucks), and I only used my fingers, too. But it's negligible.People were right in saying that the MM NXL looks a lot better in person than it does in photos. And I'm not sure how the old XL's was, but the d-pad on the New XL is so much better than the original standard 3DS's (which was the only 3DS I've had-- that d-pad was the *worst*). This fact made me pretty happy, and now I won't hate myself if I play 2-d games on it.

Not my first time going to Spain but i have never stayed that long before, I'm very excited to watch the World Cup around Spaniards because i know it gets crazy there, and yeah, i got my Spain Jersey. I'm mostly going to be in La Rioja but i'm planing on traveling South and pretty much all over the place. But ill like to know what is a "must see" this summer in Spain. As of now I'm going to La Rioja, Madrid, Cordoba, Sevilla, Malaga, Barcelona, Tenerife, and probably many more, but those are certain. Also I'm taking my unlock iPhone to put a SIM Card, whats a good cellphone company i can use there? Muchas Gracias!

We did a courthouse wedding and having our big religious wedding ceremony in Spain this summer that we are very excited about. Now, yesterday we finally gather all of our papers to go to the Spain Embassy to register our marriage with Spain. They told us we will get the "Libro de Familia" within two or three weeks. But what is the main significant of that book? I read is that when you have children you add it to your book? Does it mean anything if in the future we decide to move to Spain I register for a "Spanish residence" with that book? Because is not really a marriage certificate like is done here. Any information would be appreciated. Thank you for reading!

So last week my 07 Forester started having some electrical issues while I was driving home from work - I stopped for gas, and it wouldn't turn over so had to get a jump, and then shortly after the dash lights starting going crazy and the radio turned on and off intermittently. I felt the power steering get weaker, so I tried to turn off the main road I was on. As I was waiting for the light the engine died and wouldn't turn over. I jumped out and hooked up the little jumper battery I keep in the car, and nothing. No power at all, not even enough for the hazard lights. Middle of the intersection, during rush hour, honking cars, people yelling at me.... a bit of a nightmare. Long story short, I got towed out of there and the mechanic put in a new battery. They also said the alternator belt was a bit loose and tightened it. It seems fine now, in the half dozen hours I've driven with the new battery. I'm wondering though if there's any chance the alternator could also be an issue, or if the issues I've described could all be explained by a bad battery. I'm asking because I'm going on a rather long road trip in a couple weeks and a bit paranoid about something happening on the way. Thanks in advance. 
3gwn7v	-58818	1439505527	BurningMan	The anticipation	Two weeks, give or take, until I make the journey that I have waited years for, and the anticipation is intense and distracting and unlike anything I've ever experience. Checking /r/BurningMan has become an uncontrollable habit; I'm having vivid dreams of being on the playa, even though I've never been; I'm obsessing over lists, tracking last minute amazon orders, making jewelry, figuring out outfits, packing and repacking. Two years ago I had to cancel my trip a few months before, because of a work commitment. Last year I had an accident (ruptured spleen) exactly a month before and had to give up the journey, ticket, place in a wonderful camp, etc. Suffice it to say, I've been waiting what feels like forever, and the anticipation is overwhelming. My wise campmates have told me to do my best to be patient, because it will come and go before I realize; to let go of expectations, because it is bigger and more awesome than my puny brain can imagine; to treat this waiting game as part of the journey and direct this boundless energy and enthusiasm towards preparation. There is no point to my rambling, other than to just scream at the top of my lungs I CAN'T FUCKING WAIT! See you all in the dust.

Let's say target for race duration is to average 75% FTP. It makes sense to step up to 76% FTP on climbs because each marginal watt output results in more marginal speed gained than on flats, due to the lower aero drag at low speed. Then the flats would see 74% FTP average power output. But how much of a disparity is optimal? Is it taking things too far to consider 100% FTP on climbs and 50% on flats? What would be a way of calculating the optimal disparity from my training data?EDIT to clarify TT.

322n8g	-58819	1428631744	cars	It's 2015, why do cars allow the battery to die if you leave headlights or parking lights on?	Cars today can do hands-free sexting, but they can't turn off a light or two to save battery - what gives? I can unlock my 2015 Fiesta ST without removing the key from my pocket, but I still have to turn a dedicated switch on and off to operate the lights. Why?Disclaimer: I know there's an "auto" mode, but I prefer to have headlights and taillights on every time the engine's on, not just at night when the "auto" mode kicks on. "Auto" shuts off the lights when you exit the car, why can't "on"?[Pic of headlight switch](http://i.imgur.com/wFWuJ9G.png)EDIT: In summation, I would like to have a configuration option in the vehicle computer menu to change "Auto Headlights" from "ON at night" to "ON with engine".

Banks have lots of features, but also lots of fees and sometimes shut down accounts for bitcoin activity. Credit unions don't shut down accounts, but they lack features. Brokerages offer the features of national banks (except for brick &amp; mortar location density) without the fees and without shutting down accounts. You could try Vanguard or Schwab, I recommend:[Fidelity Cash Management Account](https://www.fidelity.com/cash-management/fidelity-cash-management-account/overview)* Monthly fees = None* Minimum balance = None* ATM fees = None. All ATM fees automatically reimbursed nationwide.* FDIC insurance = Coverage up to $1,250,000—five times more than the typical bank.* Free mobile check deposit = Scan and deposit checks with your iPhone, iPad, or Android with Fidelity Mobile®.* Free checkwriting = Get free checks, deposit slips, and online images of your cleared checks.* Free Fidelity BillPay = Receive and pay your bills on the web or on your mobile device.* Overdraft protection = Set up automated alerts, link other accounts for overdraft protection, or **disable overdraft ability**.I've sent tens of thousands of dollars to and from Coinbase through this account and have not heard a peep.

38fbyw	-58819	1433365239	Bitcoin	Larger block size *improves* decentralization. Here's how.	The block size debate: as bitcoin's user base grows, the network's resources become strained - on the node side you have limited internet bandwidth, storage, and processing power; on the miner side, you have limited number of transactions to fit in each block. When resources are limited as demand increases, price goes up. Should the price increase be pushed towards more expensive block processing (bigger blocks) or more expensive transaction fees (smaller blocks)?* Technology advancements will continually drive down the cost of processing larger blocks (bandwidth, storage, processing power).* Fixed block size will never drive down the cost of transaction fees, only increase them as demand increases.

23349w	-58843	1397563047	LifeProTips	LPT: Spend just a few minutes on cleaning or de-cluttering your living space every day.	Just do *one* thing: dust a few shelves, wipe the counters, fold laundry, remove clutter from the desk - or even a portion of it. You can still do this i.e.  while litening to music or watching a familiar show.It sounds obvious, yet for many people it's not. But it will save you a LOT of time later on. And it's not a big deal if it's only a few minutes. It will be a much bigger deal later on, when the clutter piles up.Source: personal experience. When I spent only up to 5 minutes on this for two weeks, my place got clean just like that, and it was messy as hell - i felt nauseous when I thought how much time I would spend if I tried to clean it in one go.Hope it helps at least one of you out there :)[EDIT] it works very well combined with this LPT: http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/2325gz/lpt_handle_things_once/

2c4q8u	-58843	1406717837	AskReddit	[Serious] Everything we make slowly decays. Everything we experience is lost when we die. Why do we still try?	Everything man-made decays over time. Nothing is permanent - your computer decays while you are reading this, your data with it. Your chair, you house, yourself (your body is trying to regenerate, but it loses the battle over time).History passed down through generations is being re-written or lost. Your memory as well.Everything material you strive for is only temporary, just as the satisfaction from achieving it. Every feeling, good or bad, fades away.Every day you must fight to at least maintain the status quo.Love is just a feeling. Family is just a group of people struggling with the same problem, and they all eventually die, no matter what they achieved.And it repeats over and over again.Instinct of self-preservation is indeed what kept us from going extinct. But it's an instinct which keeps us from dying... until we die.Everything enjoyable fades away quite fast. Thus, to 'enjoy here and now', one must constantly put effort in finding joy. Constant effort becomes routine, which in the end kills the joy.Using the socially accepted terms I'm 28, I have a steady job as a programmer, a loving girl, a lot of experiences under my belt, I'm not concerned with the latest gadgets or money. I ask this question not as a person who is discontent because there's something I want and can't get:Why do you try?Why do I?**[edit]**: /u/nupanick suggested thinking in cosmological scale:&gt;We may be the only chance this universe gets to find out why it's here.&gt;We should at least try, just in case there's something worth finding.&gt;We get one shot to solve the mysteries of the universe.&gt;And hell, maybe we'll get to make one of our own somedayPersonally, I like this idea. Universe is the most permanent 'thing' there is. Still, down-to-earth, mundane activities never help in focusing on this kind of idea.**[edit2]**: /u/NearlySmart suggested:&gt;Take children for an example; they approach the world with wonder and excitement. Every interaction is an &gt;opportunity to learn and experience something new. They enjoy moments as they come. One may argue that, &gt;kids actually DO have much to learn about the world; but do adults know everything there is to know? We get &gt;wrapped up in monotonous routine and allow our preformed thoughts and experiences to ruin 'the moment'. To &gt;bear the thought of everything decaying and being lost eventually kills joy faster than constant effort does.

I just recently bought my first mod, and was thinking about getting RDA for it.My question is: there's quite a few atomizers labelled as RDA, and some of them have what looks like a tank (just like in clearomizer, and I suppose liquid is slowly transported from the tank to the chamber with coil and wick), the rest don't (and as I suspect you're supposed to 'refill' them more often - the coil chamber directly).My question is - how to look for RDA's with tanks (specific terms - is it the 'tank system' or am I mixing things up?) And which are worthwhile?I used VV batteries, made a few cheap mods and I replace coils/wicks in clearomizer heads, so I guess technically I won't have problems with maintenance. Just looking for an advice which one would have a tank and be reliable :) I'm form Poland, and while the supply is decent here, unfortunately shop staff is not well-informed in many places.Thank you in advance.

For starters, I'm curious about airport checks - I'll be staying for a bout a month and I wanted to take with me:- a mod- Goblin atomizer- wire and muji cotton- an eGo battery as plus a clearomizer for backup- about 200 ml of juice (I vape DIY juice at 18mg/ml)- coiling tool (looks like a screwdriver)Should I expect any problems now, or should it be relatively painless? Is anything explicitly prohibited, or would it just raise an eyebrow here and there? Is it better to use non-labelled bottles for juice? I can't seem to find any reliable online source so far, so any tips would be greatly appreciated.Thank you in advance :)

3bnwhf	-58843	1435690514	LyricInterpretations	Europe - The Final Countdown	This came to my mind after reading a completely different interpretation [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/3b6k86/the_truth_about_the_final_countdown/) - I'd like to know if you guys think I'm stretching this too far - first the general idea, verse by verse next.Basically, because of the 'Venus' as the planet of choice, and the whole 'we're leaving together', this may lead to one of the most abused themes in rock - love. And forbidden love at that. Let's see it line by line:**We're leaving together**: two or more people, that's for sure. We don't know - and we won't, but, for the sake of argument, let's assume this is a couple.**but still it's farewell** : Okay, they're leaving - either physically as in going somewhere, maybe running away,  or metaphorically - that would mean, for example, death. Let's see what's next:**And maybe we'll come back | To earth, who can tell?**: either this journey will set them apart from the world they currently occupy - but it can all go sour, and they'll be back to their old life. If the suicide is the option, there's a possibility that they will be helped in time, thus the 'return'**I guess there is no one to blame We're leaving ground**: this can't be helped - this is something they have to do - think Romeo and Juliet or just about any of the legendary / lyrical lovers who can't live without each other.**Will things ever be the same again?**: the *journey* probably will change them forever/ nothing will stay the same (again, it can go sour, or it's permanent)**It's the final countdown**: well, it's the final countdown, time to go, no point in staying here, this is unavoidable**We're heading for Venus and still we stand tall**: venus as 'love'? This is crucial to the interpretation. If this is metaphore for love, they're standing tall - so they're proud, but it's not love that's accepted. Again, think Romeo and Juliet, or any other kind of love - homosexual, for example - mind the times when this song was written.**'Cause maybe they've seen us and welcome us all, yea** - 'they'? Or just the people surrounding them? The fact that they're not sure if 'they' would welcome them suggests that this might not be tolerated by other people. They still have hope that they will be accepted, though. Forbidden fruit yet again.**With so many light years to go and things to be found - I'm sure that we all miss her so** - leaving their old lifes behind, but still excited for the things to come; embittered, that the path they're choosing sets them apart from what they know**It's the final countdown** - time to go, stressed by many, many repetitionsSo... forbidden love theme, anyone? :)  Any kind of forbidden love associated with social stigma would do here.Lovers either or the run, or saying farewell to the world and heading to Venus, not so alive anymore. Hoping, that maybe they'll be accepted (and won't have to leave?).This is a bit refined post I made in the thread I linked to at the beginning - just to be clear.

I'm halfway there, but inconsistencies pop up like crazy even with my best effort.Is there any way I could achieve this?

mdyb9	-58872	1321414821	AskReddit	Crazy shit going on outside my house, any explanations?	So. About two weeks ago, my roommate and I were going to sleep, then the noises began. The sound of a shovel being dragged across the ground came through our window. We took a look and sure enough, there was a guy dragging a shovel outside our house. For HALF AN HOUR. We, stupidly, did not call the cops. He left eventually. A couple of days later, the sound of a pot banging wakes us up. We are too terrified to look out the window after the last occurrence.  A couple of days after that, my boyfriend and I walk to my house from about 4 blocks away, and when we get back, all my housemates were freaking out. They had all heard a man screaming bloody murder for a solid 2 minutes. This is when we called the cops. They drove by and didn't find anything. Thought I'd share this, I feel pretty crazy and scared with all this going on by my house.Anyone have any explanations besides ghosts?

nwlfq	-58872	1325274794	AskReddit	Alright! What's your stupidest and almost useless super power?	My friend and I were making up really stupid useless superpowers at work one day and we came up with some really funny ones. Mine is the ability to rip off my face in one clean piece an throw it with 100% accuracy, but just once and I still feel pain and don't heal extra fast. This power could be useful in the event I'm being attacked. I could just rip off my face and freak out my attacker by chucking a slab of face t them. What's your "superpower" (it has to be pretty lame, when it comes down to it) and what would your name be?

I was walking around downtown San Francisco one day and as I'm walking by the subway station, I hear the awful screech of someone who has no idea what to do with a violin. I stopped in front of a homeless man who was "playing" a violin for change. He just smashed the bow into the strings and let the noise wash over the little crowd that had formed around him. The man was enjoying himself, he knew he was hilarious. Every person who walked by gave him at least a dollar. Anyone else have some hilarious stories?

2mfa2n	-58890	1416097242	DestinyTheGame	Today, we rose above the darkness.	My friend (I'll call him Xur) who is level 27 wanted help with the Vault of Glass so he could do it for the first time on that character. We spent around 30 minutes attempting to find a team and no one wanted help. In defeat, we attempted it on our own, with us 2. (I'm a level 29 Warlock, by the way) I got center and right and Xur got left sync plate. Without a single death, we entered the Vault of Glass. We continued into the Templar's Well expecting to give up here. Xur covered right and I covered center and left when it came to that point. Again, no deaths. Oracles came along. I pulled out Atheon's Epilogue and Pocket Infinity, Xur pulled out his Vision of Confluence and Plan C. We had no problem with the Oracles. Then came time for Templar, which, yes, we cheesed and knocked him off. We then snuck by the Gorgons and both Glided our way to the end of the Jumping Puzzle. We were now very confident that we would defeat the Gatekeepers. I, however, was arrogant and palmed the Gatekeeper, which was the worst decision in my life. Xur stayed back and took his time to wait for me to have revive available. So, he went into Past (Left, Mars, Sand, Red) alone. I kept the Praetorians out. After that, Xur defended both the Conflux and the Sync plate, ungodly well. I went in blind, and came out ready to smash some Minotaurs. We were in awe. We just beat the Gatekeepers with 2 people. We discussed how YouTubers can do that, but us, a couple of shmucks joking around could do it. We got to Atheon and gave up after around 30 wipes of Relic Swapping and Self-Reviving. I have never fealt more accomplished than what I did this day.
2nond7	-58890	1417198085	DestinyTheGame	Fatebringer vs. The Devil You Know	I have been using my TDYK for awhile now, until I picked up the Vision of Confluence. I have not touched this gun in a very long time. I would keep it, but my Vault Space is running very low. I need to know if I should dismantle or keep. I had Fatebringer in there too, because I only use it in Arc Burn.
2ovmiz	-58890	1418230680	DestinyTheGame	Suprised there aren't any complaints about Omnigul.	Pre-TDB, I saw countless fear/hate posts about Wizards being a Raid boss or a strike boss. Then we have Omnigul: A Wizard boss, with a shield, that spawns hordes of adds, and not one complaint (from what I've seen). I died at least 5 times doing the Nightfall just from Omnigul.
2p8izk	-58890	1418533039	DestinyTheGame	Why do we get 2-3 Crucible Marks per Crucible Game?	With Vangaurd, you get 6 per Roc strike, which takes around three-fourths of the time. I have spent an hour and a half trying to get 60 marks for a Primary weapon. I have gotten 45 so far. This is a waste of time. I wouldn't mind as much if Crucible wasn't terrible.
2pgpf1	-58890	1418733591	DestinyTheGame	They should add a Level 32 Vault of Glass level when they release Crota's End Hard Raid.	This way, we can rerun Vault of Glass for its guns at 331 Attack. Its would still be considered Hard Mode, so three runs would not be possible. Armor would reach 33 Light.**EDIT:** There are complaints about Exotics not being 331 coming from Vault of Glass. Praise Oryx that if a patch fixes that, it gives us 331 VoG weapons.

2rqnj0	-58890	1420722828	DestinyTheGame	What is the whole hype about these 'Shoot to Loot' guns?	Everytime the gunsmith is selling one, I see at least 3 or 4 posts about it. When someone gets it they start freaking out saying: "This is gonna be my Sniper/Scout Rifle for the Nightfall" even though it's Uncommon rarity. There are almost no times in which I can't just walk out and grab the ammo myself, and if I can't, I always have Primary ammo. Wasting a spot for your Primary or Special is pointless, as potent weapons can be put there. I don't even see any videos of anyone using these guns. People freak out, but no one uses them. I would say the only people who should use them are people without Invective/Ice Breaker and have not gotten an elemental Primary.
2ta5yg	-58890	1421929109	DestinyTheGame	Bungie, for the next possible upcoming raid, can you please add two sets of Raid gear, one focusing on each Subclass?	I used to be a mild MMO player. Never played huge ones, but I did play them nonetheless. But what each of them had, was at least one set of Purple (Legendary, in Destiny tems) rarity gear focusing on a single tree. They would drop for both, regardless of the eqipped Subclass, but would still allow you to get max level with mixed gear. Here's some ideas for some Hunter gear revolving around Hive names:#Gunslinger**Visor of the Gun:** Missing with Golden Gun has a chance for the shot to be returned directly into the magazine.**Acolyte's Hands:** Increases Throwing Knife throw speed.**Entranced Cuirass:** Boosts Agility by 2 while Gunslingers Trance or Chain of Woe is active.**Acolyte Ligaments:** Get better Height on Double/Triple Jump when at low health.#Bladedancer**Visor of the Blade:** Killing an enemy with Arc Blade increases Agility for a short time.**Thrallskin Gloves:** Melee speed is increased after using Blink Strike**Hungering Cuirass:** While Hungering Blade is active, your Armor is increased.**Thrallskin Boots:** Reduced time to activate Stalker.#Striker**Helm of His Fist:** Increases Fist of Havoc's Damage.**Gauntlets of the Storm:** Increases Storm Fist damage against Majors/Ultras. **Plate of the Divine:** Transfusion also affects nearby teammates.**Legs of Destruction:** Increases range of Shoulder Charge.#Defender**Knight Skull:** Shots that hit your Ward of Dawn have a chance to Ricochet in any direction.**Knight Armgaurd:** Melee attacks while Force Barrier is active will cause enemies to stagger regardless of damage taken.**Knight Carapace:** Bullets have a chance to ricochet off of you in any direction while Force Barrier is active.**Knight Leggings:** Increase Lift speed while Ward of Dawn is active#Voidwalker **Eye of the Ogre:** Nova Bomb will create a Singularity where it impacted. **Mutated Hand:** Energy Drain causes damage over time to the enemy you hit.**Heart of the Ogre:** Agility is increased when Energy Drain is active.**Ogre Toe:** Blink can be used twice before hitting the ground.#Sunsinger**Wizard Crown:** Increase Recovery when Radiance is Active.**Wizard Claws:** Increase Grenade Blast radius.**Wizard Robes:** When you take damage, your super cools down faster. Solar damage taken will enhance this ability.**Wizard Energy:** Increase Glide Speed and Height.**Edit:** Meant to change the title. This isn't a complaint, I am just getting my ideas across. **Edit 2:** Did the Titan. Warlock coming soon.**Edit 3:** Doing Sunsinger very soon.**Edit 4:** Sunsinger**Edit 5:** Eye of the Ogre would make one quick pull and do no damage. It is nothing like Vortex, however, it would be very powerful while combined with it.**Edit 6:** Front Page. A cliche "Hi mom!" Required.**Edit 7:** Too many edits. I made the upgrades more PvE oriented. 
2tik0x	-58890	1422110997	DestinyTheGame	I actually really enjoy hearing the music when we pick up the Sword when fighting Crota.	
2tjxrv	-58890	1422137078	DestinyTheGame	I just got Fang of Ir Yut and noticed how useless Target Mark is. I had a few ideas as to how it can be fixed.	•Make it cause 0 damage over time, which would prevent shields from regenerating for its duration. •Cause you and your teammates to be able to see the enemy through walls.•Increase all damage that enemy takes from any source (10% more) except Fang of Ir Yut.•Enemies shot by this weapon will turn their attention to you.I really hope they do one of these to Target Mark.
2tot26	-58890	1422245617	DestinyTheGame	Why can't we take selfies with our Ghost?	It'd be a nice way to screenshot.
2u480u	-58890	1422562267	DestinyTheGame	I had an idea about how to balance out Armor drops from the Raids.	I have 3 Level 32s. Each one is missing a piece of Armor. It is very annoying having to use Lucky Shitberry on my Hunter and Mk. 44 Stand Ashits on my Titan. I get to use Apotheosis Veil on my Warlock, which isn't bad. But anyway, onto the point. Since I have gotten more gloves than a clown can juggle, I dismantle them for materials to upgrade the Chestpiece I don't have. How about when you dismantle a piece of Raid gear, it gives you an essence. Each essence can raise the Light level by 1 on ANY piece of gear (Blue included). For Vault of Glass essence (Essence of Glass) it could raise gear to have 30 Light, and for Crota essence (Essence of Crota) it could raise to 36 Light. This would also allow for some favorable gear to be upgraded.**EDIT** (As of May 21): I basically just guessed what Etheric Light was 3 months before it existed.
2vwg96	-58890	1423943464	DestinyTheGame	Pulse Rifles are insecure.	Bad Juju and Red Death are so embarrased about being Pulse Rifles that they took the bodies of other guns.Hard Light is hip and thinks Pulse Rifles are sexy, so he entered a Pulse Rifle body.

2whm6f	-58890	1424389676	DestinyTheGame	[Misc] Expect No Land Beyond tommorow.	Since TDB came out, the pattern was 2 Non-DLC exotics, No Land Beyond, then Dragon's Breath.**EDIT**: I was right.
31h17a	-58890	1428193490	DestinyTheGame	[Discussion] What do you hope the new Fatebringer/Black Hammer will be for the new Raid in House of Wolves?	I personally am hoping for the Onslaught Solution System (Machine Gun) to have Suppressing Abilities.**Edit:** A few months into House of Wolves and here we are: stuck with pointless Raid weapons. 
32eaqz	-58890	1428891014	DestinyTheGame	[SGA] You can shoot through the Hobgoblin's Stasis while using Radiance or Golden Gun.	Getting near their corpse shortly after they die still causes damage, however.

3i9hel	-58890	1440457686	DestinyTheGame	You and another person can be signed onto the same character at the same time.	On Wednesday, a friend of mine asked me to sign into his account to get Skolas done for him. We got it done, I got the Elder Cipher. To get the first step finished, I went ahead and also did 32 on his account. While I was doing 32, I noticed really weird things happening. I was getting Glimmer, Cryptarch Rep, and Engrams, along with my Shader randomly changing (he kept putting Queen's Web on, as he was really excited for it.) I was really freaked out, but I realized what was happening. He was on the XBOX One, and I was on the 360. You can both be on at the same time, in real time. You can both run PoE, or both run Strikes at the same time. We tried equipping 2 Exotics (Ice Breaker &amp; Gjallarhorn) only for one to be almost immediately swapped for a Legendary in your inventory. I will edit in proof shortly.**EDIT**: [Proof](http://imgur.com/a/X4eBD)As you can see, the times of the games are very close, and it is extrememly unlikely that someone can get the amount of kills in an activity, then start a new one in just a few minutes. **EDIT 2:** A few activities that can be boosted by having double players:•Glimmer Farming•Strike Running•Patrols for Rep Grinding•Bounty Progress (Especially Exotic Bounties, such as Elder Cipher)

3630u8	-58892	1431712377	physicaltherapy	[Question] What's actually going on in my session?	Hi guys. So my wife started working the front desk at her friends Physical Therapy practice and suggested I start treatment for my soccer related issues, mainly front of knee (patella?) and IT band causing problems an hour in to games. I've been to the therapist 3 times now and I seem to feel at least looser after she applies light to medium pressure with these little twitchy movements as well on selective areas ranging from the back of my skull along my spine down to my sacrum at different times. I've seen pamphlets for visceral/neuro manipulation in the office and figured that's the basis but I have seriously no idea what either of these things really are. Sorry for the terrible description but if anyone has any insight I'd love to hear it.

Fair enough, rail transportation stuff in the US doesn't impress her in the least but since we're such a car town the M-1 rail is intriguing.Not up on things at all, anyone care to give a rundown on the M-1 and it's status? Edit: A tad disappointed it's not something to check out yet, but thanks for running with this. Learned a bunch about what it is/could be and got a good sense of my former peoples feelings on it which all made lots of sense. Shout out to you all and can't to get in town this afternoon!

One of the adventure mode in act 5 clearing a warrior cave or something. When we enter killing stuff seem easy. An elite pack pop up with vortex i got pull into a clickable object like a pile of armor on the ground. I was stuck cannot move, cannot cast any spell or use potion. My friend was busy with the pack there are 2 little minions hitting me. I dread every second of it slowly drain my health. When i have no health left the moment i thought that screen of death popping up my heart sank. But then the health still remain at 0 and no death screen. I immediately log out. My character still there. Log back in telling my friend i was okay he was glad as much as i did.My advice is going in act 5 with extreme caution. So many little bugs yet to be discovered. Good luck. I love this hardcore community.

Can you check the portal to see what CDCs you can complete or do you need to speak with your training manager?I am interested in completing as many CBTs, PMEs, and CDCs as possible so that I can advance my career and opportunites quickly if possible.

Already noted allergy to Sulfa medications (MEPS classified as Anaphylaxis [slight skin rash]) and had to get a waiver for a P3. My PCM prescribed my Azithromycin (Zithromax) for a sinus infection and got the same reaction I got when I had taken Sulfa as a kid. I know I need to report this so they can make sure to get me other medications if need be, but will this disqualify me? There are plenty of alternatives according to the ER doctor so I would hope not.Thanks

1x8mtn	-58910	1391741415	airnationalguard	Housing for 3-year Title 10 stint?	In previous email exchanges and at RUTAs, I met my CC, my Chief, and my First Shirt. I won't go into the details, but they all said that I could very easily be put on orders for 3 years. If that is the case, would I be able to live at the dorms without moving my family from our current home? My wife and stepdaughter are legally confined to a specified location due to custody; I ask so I can figure out if I can live on base without my family and get BAH or do I need to start looking for an apartment close to my unit and access BAH and have 2 homes.EDIT: I am 3 hours from my unit, so well outside of the commuting distance. Hence my curiosity of where I would live if I get out on orders.
1xa97n	-58910	1391793223	Military	Title 10 Activation and Housing	If you live outside the local commuting distance for a guard unit and are activated on Title 10 orders, is housing provided for the member or does the member need to locate nearby housing? I have a wife and kids, one of which is a stepchild who is fixed to my current location in accordance with the custody agreement. If activated I would still need to maintain my current residence, so could I reside in dorms and get BAH for my family due to legal matters? Or could I pay to stay in the dorms and receive BAH for my duty location and not residence? The BAH at my duty location covers my rent while the BAH at my current location is about $800 more; we planned it this way in case I was ever activated, the BAH for my duty location would cover our rent. Worst case is I would have to get an apartment at my duty location to access BAH and just maintain two homes.Edit: What I have found is that if there is room in the barracks/dorms, your COC can approve stay there if your situation justifies it but they have the right to remove you if they need the space. 
1xw3th	-58910	1392380271	Military	Barrack/Dorms while on orders with dependents? Reservist.	Asked in /r/airforce and didn't generate anything, but does any member have experience with being put on orders and being allowed to live in the UH facility while receiving BAH? All I found for the AF was the AFI 32-6005 which states I'm eligible and describes the priority system for use of UH. I commute a considerable distance to my MUTAs and my wife is legally bound to our local region due to an agreement with her ex in custody for my step daughter; meaning she is legally unable to relocate without appearing before a judge for permission which puts a hardship on our family.

They wear the GWOT ribbon and had to go through basic even though they "did it at USAFA". In short they talk all hype and act way better than everybody even after failing and they struggle with the most basic of things in our school.Is there any way I can check the validity of their attendance? Its seriously pissing of the rest of us and our NCOs.

I understand there are vendors in Townlong Steepes but the JP vendor offers no gear for me, and the VP vendor offers like 522 gear but its bought with JP and Shado-Pan rep.Are there no vendors that sell gear equivalent to the latest iLvL of gear like back in other Xpacs (i.e. the vendors in Org above Garrosh)?Thanks
293jqw	-58910	1403734763	legaladvice	Relocation of Wife without violating custody order	Im currently being stationed about 3 hours away from my family for service and I have run into a snag. Her custody order states that she cannot "relocate outside of a 15 mile radius of the courthouse" without going back to court. My question is that if I got a house down at my station, could she live with me on the days she does not have custody of her daughter and then return to my in laws (where her current home of record is) for the days she does have custody? Or is this technically relocating and a violation of the order? We are in the state of Virginia and she would only end up spending M-W each week of the month with me, the remainder is at our current location. So a majority of her living is within the 15 miles even if she did come live with me 3 days a week.

The last time I played (pretty much up until when The Forgotten DLC was released) the game was pretty much unplayable when playing with certain friends.With some friends the game ran smoothly. However when playing with others the game would just freeze and then unfreeze for like a microsecond. It would sometimes take 1 minute to unfreeze to then just play for a couple more seconds to then freeze again.It definitely wasn't a severe connection issue as I could Skype them with absolutely no problem.So, has anyone else here encountered this problem before? If so has it been fixed?Thanks:)

Ever since the latest stable build they've added (not sure if on purpose or a bug) a slight weapon sway to all guns when standing still (yes, not after you've been running).This makes it extremely difficult to snipe past 200m now as it sways all over the place and it's just down to luck if you hit them, taking skill out of it.It may not be noticeable from a far, but look closely in your iron sights - it's swaying all over the place which makes being precisely accurate from a distance impossible.Yes, I've tried this on multiple characters so it wasn't me having a fracture or a glitch just on one character.I've seen one person complain about it here to then get down voted and only one person in my Teamspeak clan mentioned it. Sadly this post will probably follow the same trend and be down voted and non of the devs will notice it. I even submitted it to the feedback tracker but it was closed for being a duplicate of a completely other aiming issue (when the aim was going horizontally in the past builds).It's sad that many people don't pay attention to minor issues like this that really affect my (and most likely a few others) enjoyment of the game. And even if the new weapon sway was implemented on purpose it still jumps around erratically and isn't even smooth.

3593oi	-58928	1431055132	ottawa	Anyone else living in an Apartment ever have a stranger knocking at your door but hiding themselves from the peephole?	This has happened twice already and I have only been living here less than a week. The first time the guy was knocking very loudly, multiple times, and even stopped to listen to what I had to say, which was "who are you?" multiple times, and then eventually "Please leave", multiple times, but he didn't respond, only continued to knock loudly in between me talking.The whole time he was leaning out of view of the peephole. I understand if someone is lost and thinks they are at their friends house, but they weren't answering to "Who are you?" and wouldn't show their face. This was at 1 o'clock at night, Sunday of all days. The second time, it was at 4 in the afternoon, the person knocked rather quietly, and they tried the door. They were, like the previous time, leaning out of view of the peephole. I am just wondering if anyone else has experienced similar things, and how they have dealt with it. Thanks!

36xc9s	-58930	1432332438	leagueoflegends	I'm sick and tired of being taken hostage of in champ select.	I've had it up to here with the number of times I've had to dodge because last pick, having not gotten to play mid, has instalocked AP Gnar jungle with Clairvoyance/Barrier and forced me to either lose 5 LP to dodge or 20 LP to lose, while they get no punishment.*Surely* there has to come a point where we introduce a kick system into champion select?
39549o	-58930	1433841400	leagueoflegends	Ekko doesn't need nerfs; he needs power shifts.	Right now, Ekko has a huge problem.He isn't an entirely broken champion; his skills have counterplay for the most part and his burst is just slightly more than most other AP mids, at the cost of it being much harder to land.His outplay potential, however, will always lead to people believing he is overpowered when he manages to use his kit to win otherwise unwinnable trades.For a simple example, I'll compare Ekko's full burst cycle at level 18 to a few other 'standard' mids, assuming every skill is landed.**Ekko:** 1181 + 300% AP - ignoring the W passive damage.**Fizz:** 900 + 275% AP (+20%)**Ziggs:** 1325 + 267% AP**Xerath:** 1520 + 310% AP**Ahri:** 1154 + 274%While these mid laners are very different in their playstyles, they all stack up quite evenly in terms of damage, with champions that have harder to hit damage, Xerath for example, having far higher burst than a champion such as Ahri, who can regularly trade with relative ease.Ekko is a fringe case. He is an AP assassin that is best used for tidying up fights and dancing around the edges of skirmishes. Where as an assassin like Zed may immediately ult the enemy carry and eliminate them from the fight, Ekko needs to plan his fights in advance; where he wants to be in 3 seconds time, and assassinate accordingly.It is worth noting also that almost half of Ekko's damage comes from his ultimate, which is difficult to land without a lapse in concentration from the enemy, and while other ultimates; take Fizz for example, are relatively easy to hit and follow up on, Ekko requires a positional advantage to use his damage effectively.As they are quite similar in damage and mobility, I will continue to use the Fizz/Ekko comparison throughout.Look again at burst cycles, this time without ultimate usage.**Ekko:** 681 + 170% AP, 7s CD (w/o Parallel Convergence)**Fizz:** 450 + 175%, 10s CDThis shows, in some small part, where the problems in Ekko's kit are. For the safety Ekko has innately, through huge movespeed buffs and his instant escape, his damage and cooldowns are too low. Right now, Ekko has the ability to build no cooldown reduction items at all and still be able to perform his combos more often than most other AP assassins.This produces two options; either Ekko's cooldowns need tweaking, or his escape mechanisms do.Without comparing him to any other mid laner or looking as how his kit works, Ekko sounds like a very overloaded champion, and in some ways he is; he has a stun/slow/shield/execute all on one ability. Many of the people asking for Ekko nerfs want this ability and his ultimate gutting, but this removes his identity as a champion - his W and R reward Ekko for thinking ahead about how he wants to fight, and his ratios are high to reflect this need for strategy.The best way in my opinion, however, is to remove the slow from his passive entirely. It does not reflect on his identity at all - Ekko is shown to be fast and nimble, and allowing him to keep his movespeed boost on 3rd hit while removing the slow would help him fulfill this without being oppressive.His W is already receiving nerfs in the form of mana cost increases, and while this isn't a bad thing it will discourage players from using his W to set up fights.By taking away this slow, Ekko will have a tougher time landing his W, and will not be able to chain slows stronger than Wither with his Q and passive. This resolves a lot of the complaints about his overloaded W without having to directly touch Ekko's numbers or identity as a champion.The movespeed boost could be the same as it currently stands, and in order to compensate for removing his slow on minions/monsters, Ekko could receive 1/3 or 1/4 of his passive bonus on champions for getting a 3rd hit on a minion.The 'power shift' then would be attained by giving his W a *slightly* shorter travel time, from 3 to 2.5 seconds. This way Ekko keeps his CC potential, but it ties in better to his theme as a strategic fighter, and is harder to land due to the removal of his passive slow.Of course, I could be entirely wrong and I'd appreciate any alternative ideas.------------------------------**tl;dr** Ekko doesn't need numbers changes - his damage is similar to other midlaners with the same skill requirements. Ekko's problems with oppressive slows could all be resolved by removing the slow from his passive and reducing his W travel time; his W would be harder to hit due to removal of the passive slow, but he maintains his CC potential, and his identity as a fast moving skirmish assassin that requires thinking ahead would be retained.--------------------------------**EDIT:**So I had a look at the Champion.GG page for Ekko, and some interesting things came up.Firstly; there are only 7 mid laners with a lower winrate than Ekko - Cassiopeia, Yasuo, Jayce, Kassadin, Syndra, Azir and Ezreal. Out of these champions, I'd only consider Cassiopeia a real threat - the only only reason her winrate is mediocre is due to the nerfs she just recieved.He also has one of the highest deaths per game count, and damage dealt per game in the lower 50% of all mid laners.This is similar to LeBlanc, in that even when she had a 70-80% ban rate, her win rate was still in the low 40s. This only reinforces the fact that most of the complaining about Ekko is due to his outplay potential, not his actual upfront damage.http://champion.gg/champion/Ekko/Middle

2kp6kq	-58935	1414607207	winemaking	Critique my blueberry banana wine recipe.	I came across this recipe and will be making it with a few additions but I had a few questions about it first as this is my first time making wine. I got the recipe from here: http://www.winepress.us/forums/index.php?/topic/18199-recipe-request-blueberry-banana/Questions:1. I will be using a 6 gallon carboy so I multiply everything except the yeast pkg by 6?2. Is the acid blend high? I think 12 tsp. may be too much.3. Should I use potassium meta bisulphite instead of campden tablets?4. Should I use yeast energizer instead of nutrient as most blueberry recipes call for that including Jack Keller's.5. Is a yeast starter necessary? I was also confused by his instructions there. Do I add pectic enzyme, wait 12 hrs and add yeast starter, wait 12 hrs and add yeast pkg?6. What should I stir with? Can I pour some boiling water on a long wooden spoon and use that? And when I push in the berries, should I sanitize my hands with alcohol?7. Bolded sentences are my additions. Is it okay to use cocoa/chocolate powder instead of sugar because I want to give it a slight chocolate taste. 8. Is is it recommended to add fining agents after back sweetening or before? And should this be done at the later stage of aging or should I do this right after stabilizing the wine?9. How would this wine be classified? Is it dry or sweet? Heavy or medium bodied.10. What should the temperatures be like during these times? Is it supposed to be warm during primary and secondary fermentation and cold during aging?Blueberry/Banana Wine (makes 1 gallons)2.5 - 3 lbs of Blueberries2 lbs Including skins of Ripe but not black Bananas (no green if possible) 2.5 lbs Sugar Use Hydrometer SG should be between 1.080 - 1.0907 pints of Water1- Campden tablet2 tsps Acid Blend (Or if you have an acid test kit adjust to .60TA)1 tsps Yeast Nutrient 1/2 tsps Pectic Enzyme1 pks Yeast - Premier Cuvee or K1-V1116 Things added later after all fermentation is complete add:1 - crushed campden tablet1/2 tsp Potassium SorbateMethod1. Wash and sort berries discarding any mashed or moldy fruit. Put fruit in the freezer for approx 5 days. Freezing them will help release the juice in the berries.2. Thaw berries and put into a large bowl or pot. Use clean or rubber gloved hands or large potato masher to crush berries being very careful and make sure to mash as many berries as possible, they are very slippery. If you are using a straining bag, place bag into your Primary and pour the crushed berries into the bag and tie LOOSELY for now. If you are not using a straining bag, just put the berries into the primary and crush there. Cover for now.3. Thoroughly wash the bananas with water. Remove the top stem and bottom tip of the bananas and discard. Slice the bananas and skins into 1/4" slices. Meanwhile, in a large pot bring the 5-6 pints of water to boil and in it dissolve the sugar completely. Add bananas with skins to the boiling water and simmer for 30 minutes. If you are using the straining bag, then untie the bag and pour bananas and water into the bag with the berries. Tie straining bag and leave in primary. If you are not using the bag, just pour the banana sugar mixture into the primary with the berries. 4. Cover primary and wait 2-3 hours to set the color, then add the rest of the water (Cold).5. When cooled to room temp stir in the acid blend, nutrient and the one crushed campden tablet. If you have a hydrometer strain some juice (remove all banana mush or you will get a false reading) check SG and adjust if necessary with sugar or water to a starting SG of 1.080 - 1.095. Cover and allow to sit for 12 hours.6. After the 12 hours add the pectic enzyme, recover and let sit again for another 12 hours. If you are going to use a yeast starter, (see below) then start it now.7. At the end of the second 12 hours open the primary and sprinkle the yeast pack on top of the must, (or add the yeast starter) and recover. In 8 hours lightly stir the yeast in to the must and recover. Fermentation should start with in 24 - 48 hours.8. Push the fruit cap or bag down under the liquid 2 times a day, morning and evening to keep the fruit or bag wet and to extract juice.9. When SG drops to 1.010 (5-10 days) remove the bag or the fruit pulp and LIGHTLY squeeze to extract juice and discard fruit. Siphon the wine into a secondary carboy, fit airlock and allow to sit for 2-6 weeks to completely finish fermentation.10. When all fermentation is fully complete, rack off sediment in to a clean sanitized carboy. Stir in 1 crushed campden tablet per gallon, (or 1/4 tsp potassium metabisulphite per 6 gallons) and 1/2 tsp potassium sorbate per gallon to stabilize. (Do not skip the sorbate if you intend to sweeten this wine later) 11. Rack again in 2 months and then rack every 2-3 months until perfectly clear about 6-12 months. If desired, one crushed campden tablet can be added every other racking to protect the wine.**When wine is clear, add about a cup of chocolate powder to sweeten and give a chocolate flavor.****When wine has settled after sweetening, rack and add fining agents (eg- SuperKleer)**12. When wine is perfectly clear and near bottling stage, you may fliter and or sweeten to taste. Some may enjoy this wine dry, but most will enjoy it sweetened back up just a tad more. Sugar can be stirred in a little at at time tasting frequently. When you reach the desired level of sweetness reinstall the airlock and let it sit for at least 30 days racking one more time before bottling to remove any sugar sediment. It will usually take approx 1/4 lb of sugar per gallon give or take.13. Bottle and allow to sit for at least 8-10 months before tasting. It will be even better after a year.Also Blueberry can sometimes be tough to get started, here is a Yeast Starter that you can use to make sure it starts with healthy yeast.Yeast starter for 5-6 gallonIn a mason jar, measuring cup or container add-1 cups warm water 80-90 F2 pinch citric acid1/2 tsp nutrient2 Tbls sugar dissolved in the waterWine YeastYeast starter for 1-3 gallonsIn a mason jar, measuring cup, or container add-2/3 cup warm water 80-90 Fpinch citric acid1/4 tsp nutrient1 Tbls sugar dissolved in the waterWine YeastLet the starter sit and work for 24 hours in a sanitized mason type jar (I use a 2 or 4 cup measuring cup) cover loosely with a paper towel. in 12-24 hours it will really be rolling (if it isn't you might have a problem with that pack of yeast) When you are ready to add the starter, stir up your must a bit to introduce oxygen, then pour the starter on top of the must. Do not stir in at this point. Wait about 8 hours then gently stir the must

Hi guys, I'll be buying all starting supplies including polishers, pads, waxes, etc. I plan on buying from detailedimage and I see they have 20% off coupon currently but I was wondering if anyone knows if they have a better deal later on.

2qv23f	-58935	1419981169	winemaking	Help! Wine fermentation hasn't started after pitching yeast.	Hi so I need some advice on my wine. I'm making 3 gallons of blueberry wine. So I crushed the berries and topped off with a little water and added 2 campden tabs 2 days ago. Yesterday at about 8 or 9 at nightI threw in the rest of my ingredients including sugar and the yeast (kv 1116) which I rehydrated. I rehydrated the yeast in 50 mL 104F water and left it for about 15 minutes but I did this in a cup so there were some yeast that didn't get water on them but I mixed them after 15 min, added a bit of my must and then dumped that in. My OG was 1.090. So last I checked today at 3:30 there was no visible activity. So I mixed it around and some bubbles come up but I don't know if those are from CO2. And my SG right now is 1.090.So I can't go to the LHBS until tomorrow but I have some campden tabs. Should I throw one in if there is no visible sign of fermentation within 6-8 hrs to protect it from bacteria until I could get some yeast tomorrow?

34nquj	-58935	1430601212	ChronicPain	Intro post? Any help?	Hey guys I'd like to introduce myself and see if anyone's in a similar situation or could help me out. I'm 20m. About a year ago I was deadlifting and likely bulged a disk resulting in mild to moderate muscle spasms from then to now. They've been intermittent and high and low but they haven't gone away at all. I've done a month of physio and still do the exercises every day. I'll be seeing my doctor soon for the results of my ct scan to gain any info whether it's inflammatory or structural. A few days ago I just tried squatting the bar for a few sets but the next day my tightness/spasms were very spread out and intense. Should I keep doing these or is it detrimental? So far not much as helped. I used an ems machine though and that made my muscles sore for a week and was hopeful that was part of recovery but it went back to how it was after and I'm not getting those same results from it. Anyone in a similar position? Any tips on how to get out of it?

3brycz	-58935	1435772662	AskDocs	Costochondritis and surgery.	Background: 20M, 6', 175 lb. 2 years ago I was bench pressing and felt a pop in my chest that slowly increased in pain over a few weeks. I went to the doc and was prescribed rest. Over these two years the condition has gotten better but has constant flare ups, especially when I try to work out which is making me depressed that I can't. I haven't had a CT for the chest yet but might sometime in the future. I suspect the cartilage that was damaged is probably healed quite a bit but there is probably some chronic damage. My question is whether it is possible to perform some type of surgery for this condition? I know knee cartilages get repaired and replaced everyday, but my doc says no surgery for this is possible. Is that true? Isn't there some kind of experimental surgery I could undergo. I would hate to live my life with this nagging pain. I appreciate any help. 
3bxwlc	-58935	1435888011	winemaking	Using fruit juice instead of water.	I've read some posts about people using fruit juice instead of water completely when making their wine (using 100% blueberry juice for blueberry wine). Has anyone tried this and how did it turn out? Is this a common practice?

3dkzby	-58935	1437101943	costochondritis	Who else is on here with costo? And question about surgery.	Basically, I'll copy over what I posted at the BB forum thread. Hey all I thought I'd add in my experience with costo. I got it in the late summer of 2013 and I know the exact instant it happened but I found out it was costo a few months later. I was doing a flat bench and average weight for me but I struggled on the last rep and that's when I felt a pop. I rested after that for as long as I could and then saw a doc about it when it wouldn't change. It's about 90% healed but I will not be doing any weightlifting right now because I'm hoping to get a CT scan done and actually see what's going on and then proceed from there. During this time, I had constant pain for the first 6-8 months then it really settled down after not working out at all. I'd say I've been at this level for about a year now. I'm 20 right now so I think I can wait a bit. I don't have any pain but I will occasionally feel a quick minor stabbing sensation that tells me it's there. So my plan is to get a CT and if there's inflammation there I'm hoping to get a cortisone shot to get rid of it and then give myself even more time to get healed up (assuming inflammation has been blocking my healing). Also does anyone know of any surgery for this? My doc told me none is possible but I'm sure there are doctors willing to try new methods. How can entire knee cartilages get replaced but our chest cartilage can't. I think I read somewhere about taking out a part of our cartilage, growing it out in the lab into healthy cartilage and replacing it. What do you guys think or know about this? Anyone with costo here who's really rich and can get this treatment?

3idyjf	-58935	1440539257	Entrepreneur	Business idea discussion- High end car leasing.	Hey guys, just throwing out an idea that would be fun to discuss. I was thinking of how a high end car leasing company would work. I think target consumers would be professionals who want a new ride every few months. This way, a premium can be put for a short term lease (3 months). Premium could be 50-100% more than a regular lease. I'm just thinking how feasible this is. Eg- A nice porsche would be about $80000 used. How much would a monthly lease price be if someone would lease this for 3 months. It would take a while to get your money back if $1000 a month. Might have to be $2500-$3000. These are probably ballpark ranges. Seems like it would work out doing it long term. I wonder how depreciation would factor in. And then insurance, and potential accidents. Definitely something to think about.What do you guys think? Anything to add?

ysppd	-58949	1345877047	selfharm	I need to get help	So here's my story I've been self harming for about 6 years for various reasons but I do it now because I think I'm forming PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) of being molested by a boyfriend at the time and my birth mother being mentally abusive. Some days I feel super fantastic and other days I don't. I'm also transgender (female to male) and carry a lot of baggage with past experiences of bullying by family and from school. Kids at school would tell me to go deeper and just kill myself. Whether kidding or not those words really sunk in. I tried to kill myself so many times with pills, cutting deep, hell I even had a knife ready to go straight into my heart.No one really knows any of this. My best friend doesn't even know half of this. But I want to stop hurting myself I just don't know how. If someone could help me get into the right state of mind that would be wonderful
ysvtw	-58949	1345892853	confession	What really happened (possible trigger)	2 and a half years ago when I was a freshman I was molested by a boyfriend at the time. We seemed like a really good couple for a bit, but after a good week of dating him he always wanted to do some kind of sexual activity and I wasn't up for that all the time. One time we went behind a Dick's Sporting Goods and that's when I went down on him, I didn't want to and I told him that, but he really wanted me to do it so I did. A few days after that he invited me to his house and his parents weren't home so he thought what better way to spend it than to do something sexual. I didn't feel the same I just wanted to hang out but he would take every chance he got to finger me. I asked him to stop every time he was trying to go for it but that wasn't enough so I blocked his hand and again that wasn't enough. Eventually I stopped saying anything so he proceeded. I hated every minute of everything he did to me for those 2 some months. Inside I was confused of what was going on because I wasn't educated about sexual abuse but I knew it wasn't feeling right. Every time this would happen I would feel really guilty afterwards. I've tried killing myself and I've been cutting because of the guilt I still feel. I truly believe it was my fault because I didn't try hard enough to stop him. I haven't been to the doctor about it but from research I've done I think I'm developing PTSD because so many things trigger me breaking into a flashback. Just looking at my bed sometimes triggers me. I just wonder if it's going to ever end or am I going to have to end my life for it to stop.
yttmu	-58949	1345936923	UnsentLetters	What I wish I could tell my best friend	I've been friends with my best friend of 8 years and I feel like a bother telling her things I should probably tell her.I may seem super happy most of the time but I'm really not. I still hurt myself even though you thought I stopped 4 years ago. A lot of nights I want to call you and tell you how I feel but I'm just afraid I'm a burden to you. I don't want to bring you down with me because you're such a free spirit I don't want to make you feel for me. When I'm stoned with you I'm usually fine but a lot of the time I'm concerned of what you think of me. You, Zoe and my sister are the only people that I really care and love for. And with my eating disorder that you knew about is still going on. When you and Zoe comment on how my body looks nice I really don't think it. I still think my body looks disgusting even after losing 20 pounds. I know you're my best friend for life because of what we've already been through but I'm just scared to tell you how I really feel deep inside. I want to tell you about all the nights that I wanted to kill myself and let you know that I'm not doing okay though my laughter shows otherwise. One of these days I'll be able to tell you but for now this stays between me and anyone who reads this
yu685	-58949	1345951632	offmychest	It isn't healthy 	Back in the 6th grade (6 years ago) I started becoming aware of my body weight and decided to stop eating for a few days on and off too see if I could shed a few pound. Sure enough I did but then I started being obsessive and wanting to lose more and more weight though I was under 110 pounds at the time. Eventually my parents and friends started noticing so I started eating a little bit more but behind everyones back I still didn't eat. I'd take dinner into my room and throw it outside. Still to this day I don't eat much and no one knows about this, I do self medicate with marijuana because it helps me eat/helps with my depression and in hopes to get my medical card in the near future. But either way that anorexic person is still inside of me. I see a chunky person in the mirror and absolutely hate what I look like. I wish food wasn't mandatory I would never eat again to lose this weight if I could. I'm currently around 120 and 5'3 and hoping to lose more by this next year. I'm worried when enough is enough to make me feel comfortable again. I know this isn't a healthy way but it's the only way I know, if I don't eat it I won't gain it. I want to be in a healthier state of mind and not see my body the way my mind sees it.

yum32	-58949	1345983096	offmychest	I'm out but with no major support	So I officially came out to my parents that I'm transgender (FTM) over a year ago and they still don't call me by the right pronoun. Even though I've asked them a million times to please call me Seth and he, they said I'm too demanding and I don't deserve it until I can prove I'm being respectful or some bull shit. Honestly growing up in a homophobic lifestyle fucking sucks. You don't have to be fully okay with it but at least not totally against it. My birth mom wants nothing to do with me now that I'm a male and it's the worst possible feeling. My dad and his wife say they're fine with it all but really why can't you simply just try to call me by my requested name instead of being selfish. I also finally came out to my sister, I thought she'd be a little more supportive than she was. I asked her if she could call me Seth or at least try and she goes "Ehh." I really wanted her to be the first one to love me for who I am in my family. It looks like when I eventually raise up 6 grand+ for surgery I'm ditching everybody and starting a new life. I don't want to live in this situation anymore. I have my best friend and her family for support which is a good positive. This coming April will be my 2 year post coming out celebration and I'm excited to get re-corrective surgery when the time comes, I'll be top notch at peace with myself. Anyways I should probably stop ranting, I just wanted to let my feelings out, not a whole lot of people know this all effects me so much.

So here's the situation; my sister kicked me out the other day so I've been staying at a friends house but they got a small place and a kid. I need a more permanent place where I can keep my stuff, I have until the 29th of May to get my stuff out of my sisters place. I have a little less than a grand saved up and payday is Friday. I work min. wage in Gresham, in hopes to stay in Gresham but Portland or Sandy is the furthest I'll go, gotta be in bus distance. Craigslist for roommates hasn't been too much help, given that I'm transgender and all that. All I really want is a roommate that'll be accepting. I can pay 400 tops, maybe more but it's definitely pushing to live comfortably. Maybe this subreddit would help me outThank you

1ugmfw	-58951	1388933840	pokemon	I think I'm playing Pokemon wrong.	So I've been playing Pokemon the same way from the beginning. I'm a "use one pokemon" kind of guy. The inclusion of this particular exp. share in X/Y was amazing for me, suddenly I felt like I could use any pokemon in my party, and I didn't have to grind them all to make them battle-ready! However, as I read stuff on /r/pokemon I see two kinds of people- the crazy ev/iv breeders that find the main game easy, and those that found the main game challenging and difficult.I didn't find the game challenging at all, but I'm not an IV/EV master breeder either, I use a fire-type as my main (shooting for Ninetales if it's available), and I can solo anything at my level unless it's a direct counter. Is my Ninetales in X/Y just that good? I feel like I want a more challenging Pokemon game that I can't solo-pokemon through battle after battle, am I missing some dynamic? Am I just getting lucky with IVs that I know nothing about? Should I feel like I'm "playing the game wrong", or is this why things like Nuzlocke exist? I know there's no "right or wrong way to play a game", and I'm not saying I didn't/don't enjoy X/Y, it's my favorite since Silver, but I feel like there's a facet I'm missing to my overall enjoyment of the game.

25es2z	-58951	1399943332	DaystromInstitute	Does the Enterprise D have artificial gravity built in to each deck?	So I was watching "The Next Phase" in TNG, where Ro and La Forge are phased and it always bothered me that they were able to pass through walls but never fell through the floor. It was during the scene where La Forge kicks the Romulan captain out into space that it hit me. I always thought of artificial gravity as coming from a singular point, most likely right below the ship, but now it makes sense that each deck would have it's own gravity drawing the crew toward the floor. However, wouldn't subsequent levels all with their own gravitational pull of the same force cause the crew to simply float in mid-air between decks? If it's from a singular point wouldn't those on decks closer to the gravitational pull feel more weight pressing down on them?TL;DR- ELI5 How does artifical gravity work on starships? Edit- I read a few threads about a giant spinning disk underneath the deck, but that still wouldn't solve the issue of crew floating between levels as the force on one deck is the same as the next, and if there was one singular disk, then crew would feel a stronger gravitational force the closer they got to that deck. The only other explanation would be that they are able to generate the consistency by projecting the disk's gravitational center further away, thus giving the entire crew the same experience we have on Earth where we are relatively unaffected by elevation changes, as we are further away from the gravitational center.

I'm just wondering if anyone else sees things on television shows or movies that is inaccurate or portrays trees and smoking incorrectly. I'd really like to hear what you guys have to say!For example, what has always bothered me ever since I started smoking trees, is how whenever a character on a TV show or movie takes a hit from a bong. They fill the entire bong up with smoke, take a small hit, and then just let the bong sit there with smoke pouring out instead of clearing the hit that they took letting it go to waste. I call this a "Hollywood Hit" whenever one of my friends decides to torch the bowl and milk the bong but then just bails out mid-hit.

36fkel	-58959	1431994607	BabyBumps	My ass cheek hurts!	Hi bumpers! I need some sort of validation here. I'm currently 9 weeks. I know I'm already suffering from RL pain. When I get up suddenly or fart or sneeze, the area around my hip bones ache. But what's really weird is my left ass cheek kills. It happens when I'm on my feet for long periods of time or when I'm getting up from a seat. I work retail so I'm on my feet for 7+ hours but I wanna know what gives! It's seriously like someone punched me in the ass. Are there any ass pain sufferers that could commiserate with me?

38q0rd	-58959	1433539557	BabyBumps	Need some advice/input!	Hey bumpers! So here is my dilemma. I currently work a retail job with hours that fluctuate a lot and in an environment which I am becoming increasingly resentful towards and burnt out in. That being said, I have an interview for a "desk job", for lack of a better term on Tuesday. The hiring lady knows I'm pregnant as a close friend of mine also works there and asked her if I should apply. She said it didn't matter that I was and to apply and much to my surprise, I was called in for an interview. Now here's the rub. At my current job, I have been here for 4 years and work enough weekly to qualify for FMLA. No worries there. If I do get offered this job, I would be about 6 weeks short of FMLA. It's at this point I'm not sure how things would work. I'm not worried about pay as I would be receiving my retirement payout from my previous job, but it's actually having the security of having a job at all to come back to I'm worried about. I want this new job so bad as it would be a better schedule, better commute and just less stress. I'm willing to sacrifice some things but I'm most concerned about how keeping that job would go. Obviously I'm going to be asking these questions in the interview but wanted a little input or advice on the matter. Tldr? Interview for a new job but would be short for FMLA. Thoughts and experiences needed.

3a1n4f	-58959	1434467153	BabyBumps	I don't even know what to call this...	So I have been suffering from sciatic pain and I had my first trip to PT last week. However with the exercises I've noticed I'm even more sore than before and the pain is traveling up into the base of my spine. But something weird happened last night. I was lying in bed and suddenly woke up to a charlie horse on my left side of my back. It's the same side I've had sciatic pain in and it took me 15 or so minutes to get it to relax. I had to prop myself up with a pillow and breathe audibly. It felt like someone was sitting on my back or compressing it, plus the obvious muscle spasm. Not sure what it was or what could've caused it. I drink constantly so I don't think I was dehydrated. I have another PT appointment Friday but wanted to see if anyone else has had this happen. I'm wondering if maybe it's related. Also 13+2 for reference. 
3aq3d7	-58959	1434989884	BabyBumps	Needing some input/advice...	So, at about 8-9ish weeks I was told I have pregnancy induced sciatica. I know a lot of you ladies know the struggle so I won't get into how much it blows. Anyways, about a week ago, I was finally given a note to allow me to sit (when necessary) at work on a stool. I'm a retail assistant manager at a major cell phone carrier, so I'm on my feet anywhere from 5-8 hours a day. It was exacerbating my condition and I was often times going home feeling horrendous. I'm still having issues, the sitting only helps so much. Most days I feel like I've been hit by a bus. But that's not what my issue is, issue is what my manager off handedly said to me as she was leaving work Friday. I was sitting on my stool and conversing with a pair of my reps when she walks up, points at me and goes "Yeah, so you know, you'll need to keep that at a minimum." I stared at her and didn't say anything. She had already been driving everyone, including me, crazy that day and I knew it was probably best to hold my tongue. I've told my husband, mother and best friend about it and they all think it's bullshit that she even made that comment. I have a medical reason and documentation stating I need to sit when I feel it necessary. I'm not sure how SHE can put restrictions on when I can sit or can't, seeing how she isn't my doctor. It makes me so mad and I feel like this could turn into a HR nightmare if she tries to enforce it. At our company, they are required to provide reasonable accommodations for anyone needing it, which includes pregnant women. Hi, I'm pregnant WITH a doctors note. How is what she's doing legal?? This isn't the first comment she's made a comment to me either, about my pregnancy. When I told her I needed a bottle of water on the floor-she refused to let me do so until I got a note. She's also made side handed remarks about my eating habits and enjoys making jokes about my pregnancy. I ignore that stuff because it's trivial, but the comment about me being able to sit when I'm in pain(which lets be real is all the time) just set me off. Am I being unreasonable? Or am I overreacting? I feel like she's picking on me because I'm pregnant and that isn't ok. I want to avoid calling HR because I feel like it'll cause more problems than not. But at the end of the day, I'm not in the wrong here. I have a medical reason to sit. I go home a lot of nights in tears because I hurt so bad. Tl;dr? Rude boss made a comment about my sitting due to sciatica even though I have a note for it. What do?

3fyir4	-58959	1438830141	BabyBumps	I feel like punching all the things. /rant	So, I'm on the verge of a complete meltdown with ugly tears. My husband starts his teaching job this August. I am due at the end of December (20th to be exact). His finals schedule for his students starts the week of the 15th. I mentioned to him that if I go into labor, I'll obviously want him there. And he goes off saying he wouldn't be able to just leave. That, by law, a substitute has to be in the room before he leaves. He said he could request the day off now-which seems utterly stupid to me because although I am a FTM, baby doesn't give us an exact day when he will arrive. I am aware that most FTMs go late, which is fine. However, I can't plan for when his baby will come and I want the peace of mind knowing I won't be alone in the delivery room. I want the peace of mind to know that if I call, he can leave immediately and head to the hospital. He has 2 weeks off for winter break, but after that nothing because he hasn't worked at the district long enough for FMLA and his school offers no sort of paternity leave. I've already come to terms with doing this other stuff pretty much on my own because again, we can't predict when baby will arrive. I could deliver early and I get my husbands help for 2 weeks, or I could I late and have no one. So I've come to terms with that. What I am ABSOLUTELY AND UTTERLY not ok with is my husband not being there when I deliver or during the entire process. I tore into him and told him he needs clarification from his principal. I'm not asking for him to request time ahead of time. That's silly. All I am asking for is the comfort of knowing that if I call my husband because I AM IN LABOR, he will be allowed to leave to come be with me. I find it utterly ridiculous that someone would tell him no you have to stay and wait for a sub and may miss the BIRTH OF YOUR FIRST CHILD. Like I am beyond enraged. I already know I probably won't have any help after baby boy arrives, but having NO support in the delivery room?! I can't even cope. I just need someone to tell me it'll be ok. :(

1oodf8	-58974	1382049760	fatpeoplestories	Battle for the spot with Mega Beetus Bitch 2000!	Hi and Good Morning all my McBeetus loathing minihams.Long time Lurker, Enjoy.Be me 5' 6" Mexican descent male, 180 lbs (I'm chubby in the gut area due to being a crippled U.S. Navy Fleet Marine Force Hospital Corpsman and thus because of being crippled and in chronic debilitating pain can't workout too much but I try as hard as I can not to become a fullblown Hamplanet), but I regress this isn't exactly about me its about the monsterous hulk of blubbering adipose tissue which decided it was more entitled to a handicapped parking space than all the individuals in my car. The events from this story took place about a week ago at BeetusMart due to being broke and also not having anytime to go to range with my brother-in-law we practice with pellet guns to keep our fundamentals fresh so we went to purchase more pellets. In the vehicle this fine day was my wife (driver, as my legs decide to die on me intermittedly), mother-in-law a.k.a. Veijita (disabled and oldish, well, she acts like shes 150 yrs old. but I love her none the less) and my previously mentioned brother-in-law (disabled with fucked up back due to having 1/2 ton crate of walnuts knocked over by dumbass co-worker at the storage/shipping place he worked at land on top of him and almost killed him). Yeah yeah it was a car full of cripples have your chuckles now and lets get on with the story and the green text.&gt;Be me bored and tired of homework from O-Chem. and Pre-Calc. (Also studying for Midterms, thus stressed) want to shoot something, so did my brother-in-law.&gt;Wifey agrees to take a break from her nursing HW and give us ride to BeetusMart for pellets, Veijita decides she wants to go too, thus she came.&gt;Arrive at BeetusMart looking out windows ready to run like a miniham staring at a twinkie attached to a string on a stick.&gt;Park car in unoccupied handicapped spot, (closest one to the door) Ham Planets must of felt a disturbance in the force and thus must of sent a emissary.&gt;We get out of car and loh and behold was a vehicle which oddly was lowered on one side than the other until we heard the ungodly rumblings of the beast which dwelt within it.Now I have 4 different kinds of days due to my fucked up Poly-Neuropathy which has token over my entire peripheral nervous system and pain from said nerve damage, each as follows:Great days: Fucking feeling awesome, love these days, relatively little to negligable pain. Good days: Pain is present but managable, at least I don't need my cane...I fucking hate that thing.Bad days: No amount of morphine is able to quell this fucking pain and thus need my cane to ambulate around as to limit the amount of pressure sustained by my lower extremities.Worse days: In so much fucking pain, I'm actually bedridden and if need to ambulate have use a wheel chair... it's actually kind of fun to be in when not in horrible pain.*Also as an additional note, both my wife and I grew up and lived in very poor and ghetto areas during our upbringings. Ironically enough I mainly hungout with black guys for a very good portion of my service, so I got used to using the word Nigga in open dialog. And still do. They didn't mind and even said it was cool only because I was a "spick". (Robinson, a guy I hungout with and knew from Corps School all the way til our second commands).&gt;This day was a good day, so I hop out of the car with no real trouble and wait patiently for everyone to get ready to enter the Land of Da Beetus, when I hear this monstrosity belch, "Hey! Git out mah spot you don't need it like I do!"&gt;Now as it was still residing within its shell of a beat to shit minivan, also it being night time, I was unable to see exactly what was in that metallic faded shit green hull.&gt;Then it emerged, slowly the minivan door opened to reveal the horrible mass of gelatenous nigga skin which probably stood about 5' and weighed in at about 350-400 lbs, which I thus have name Mega Beetus Bitch 2000, she once again regaled me with her statement of "That's mah spot get out of it!", "I need it more than you cus' o' mah Condishun."I didn't actually think people said that shit before that moment. I thought it was some shit that was said on FPS to make it good for the fucking luls. But no she stood there with her deep dark nigga mega ham planet self mad dogging me and my family who had all exited the car as if we had stolen the last bucket of KFC from her greasy grasp.&gt;I say, "Sorry Ma'am, we're already here and we aren't moving, please don't disturb us." (Ma'am, because of military background and also my wifey keeps me in line as to be a good boy instead of the horrible angry person I truly am).&gt;Killanig the Orca whale becomes enraged by my statement and possibly fearful of actually losing "her spot", even though I was trying to be polite and blocks our path to Beetusmart with her massive girth. As she did this she spit out, "You fuckin' little shit! You don't have a right to be in that spot! I need it mah doctor said I haves a Condishun and need to park in the closest spot to where eva I goes."&gt;Now I'm getting irritated by Beetusaurus Rex and told her to get out of my way and also take a step closer to her orbit to intimidate her.&gt;She must have sensed some of my Alphaness (yeah I know and I don't care) and shuffled to the side of her vehicle, but just as I thought everything had been taken care of she looks at my wife who can honestly be kind ghetto herself due to having also grown up poor as fuck, but restrained herself because she saw I had handled it. She looks my wife up and down as if trying to see how many chomps it would take to devour her and barks "Da fuck ya' lookin' at you stupid skinny lil' bitch?!?"Now I don't care if someone disrespects me, I got used to it due to having spent more than  half of my Naval Career with the Corps, My Marines had learned me in the ways of shit talking and how to verbally destroy someone. But if you disrespect my wife you're done. &gt; I swing around quick and hard and fucking let loose all my pent up stress on this monstrosity of nature. "What the fuck did you just say? Are you seriously fucking kidding me right now? You come up to us, spouting off about we being in "your spot" and being a unholy heinous bitch!". "You know what?, No you don't deserve this fucking spot, do you know why? Its cus you're a discustingly fat fucking waste of fucking space you lard filled fucking cow pie!"&gt;"Oh and about your fucking condition, let me guess you've got weak knees or ankles, I bet its even diabetes? Am I fucking right?! Well guess what you did it to yourself, Yes YOU! You lazy fat nasty shit." You became like this because you're too fucking lazy to get your fat ass up and walk more than a couple of fucking feet before finally realizing it requires some fucking exertion of energy and work!"&gt;"Do you happen to know why I'm in that spot? Do you happen to know why I have Handicapped Plates? It because of THIS (I point at my cover which says, Corpsman and has the USMC Emblem on it along with "They call me Doc" and "Corpsman up!") I'm a fucking COMBAT VET BITCH! I was fucking blown up for this fucking country and for its fucking freedoms and apparently for your fucking right to be a fucking horribly fucking fat idiotic sloppy mess of a shit stain in my path! I fucking hope you die here and now and guess what I won't do a fucking thing for you because you deserve nothing less than death! Now get the fuck back into your piece of shit car and disappear from my fucking sight before I personally end you here and now!"&gt;Jabba da Gut must of got the message and waddled her fucking ass back to her van and drove off into the horizon as she did so my wife and her family just stood there dumb founded because I'm usually a pretty chill guy (well my wife already knows about my PTSD and anger issues but she keeps me in line and makes me happy).&gt;Brother-in-law was the one who broke the momentary silence what was only backgrouded by my angered breathing, "Well, are we still going to get those fucking pellets?", "Maybe we can draw a picture of that fat bitch as our target?" which immidiately makes me laugh a little and wifey comes to me, kisses me and asks if I'm ok. Note: Veijita has never seen me pissed before that moment, yesterday she told me I need to get a weed card to chill out a little bit.Well, that was the story kids hope you enjoyed it.TL;DR:Go to BeetusMart to buy pellets for shooting practice, land whale tries to fight us for spot and I verbally destroy it.*slight editing for grammar and for more info on my behalf.
1pc9oz	-58974	1382911682	fatpeoplestories	Fat logic at the Irvine park railroads pumpkin patch	Just saw this at the Irvine park pumpkin patch, female Ham Planet about 5'3" &amp; easily pushing 350+ buying "snackies" from  the food stand and asked her slightly plump kid what he wanted. He answered back that he wanted an apple and jabba da gut snapped back at him that the $1 apple was a waste if money, as she and four other hammies in their solar system each possessed a plate which held a self decorated cookie with about 1 1/2 to 2" of cheese whiz type canned "frosting" which cost 1 ticket. Each ticket is $5... 5 cookies, including the 5 they each demolished in while waiting in line for snackies equals $50... A $1 apple her kid was asking for was a waste of money. God Damn It... He wanted to make the right choice but was shutdown by his monstrousity of a mother...WTF.  Editing for the missing info for the math and I'm typing this quick on my phone.

22h4a0	-58974	1396917825	CorpsmanUp	Sea stories and shit I did to my Marines.	So here's mine. Ready? Set? Get your ass out if the fucking way and listen here. Stationed in Camp Pendleton during 06' right before my deployment to Al Asad. Doing sick call like a good Lil Doc does and in comes shuffling a boot so wet behind the ears he's practically drowning himself. Told me he's never been to sick call before and I'm the first Doc he's ever actually talked to... here's where the evil within awakens due to this new found knowledge... apparently baby boots here had been doing pre-deployment training and had jumped out the back of a armadillo and stupidity kicked into high gear and he rolled his right ankle upon landing... classic Marine sprain. So I wrapped it and told him to R.I.C.E. it and gave him motrin. Now this is where I did the bad... I asked him if he's ever taken an 800 motrin before, he says no... light bulb!  I convinced boots they were suppositories and that it was the only way they'd work. After several minutes of instruction on how to put in a suppository he starts to leave and slowly and sadly walks out of the B.A.S. With a bottle of motrin and an ace bandage... Some of my junior Corpsmen were overhearing me as I treated him and gave me an "oh god you didn't? " look so I ran back to the boot and told him I was messing with him and to take them with water also not up the butt... I also took the lube I gave him to sell him a better story. He perked up really quick as I told him this and ran off, I'm guessing before I'd do something even more terrible to him. Well that's one story, yeah I've got more enjoy and have fun.
2446xw	-58974	1398619491	atheism	If you went to church today...	Soooooo.... apparently today is a day in Catholic belief that after the resurrection of jebas on the Sunday after easter if you came to church and partook of the communion you will be forgiven of all sins thus essentially reverting you back to the state of post baptism where if you died you'd automatically go straight to heaven. Seriously?  The priest also joked that he was very tempted to walk across the street several times with his eyes closed as to attain such a gift... oh no that wouldn't be misunderstood as suicide but as simply giving ones self to god. Seriously what the fuck? They expect people to truly believe this shit? But looking around, there are people just fucking eating it up and going back for more. I can't understand how this makes sense to some people.
24cdqb	-58974	1398833137	atheism	My life as of now.	I go to church practically every Sunday. My wife is Catholic along with her mom and grandmother aka Nana. Nana is super Catholic although I suspect she is simply one of those old school indoctrinated Catholics who were taught that the church is infallible thus she already a lost cause. Her and my mother in law. My wife well she's an intelligent and critically thinking individual,  but loves her mom and Nana beyond anything else and try to be the good little girl she can for them, specifically for Nana. This is due to Nana being a bit of an old bitch, but only under the rug. She doesn't realize she is because she just knows she's a god fearing woman and thus is right in everything she does. Hell, this most recent Sunday,  we all got to church semi-late and it was packed so we sat in the rear and she saw us, greeted us, and but willingly chose to find a seat with people who appeared to be strangers or at least people who only went to church around the major holidays in the front pews instead of sitting with us her family. All because it was the fucking front.I suspect wife knows I'm atheist but has not said anything about it or brought it up because well I haven't said anything either. That plus we're the godparents for our niece, so we're supposed to teach her to be a good Catholic even though I've never been Catholic. I do cause a few ripples every once in a while in Nana's opinion which always pisses off my wife because, oh I can't hurt Nana's feelings or even state my mind because apparently I'm a dick... which I admit I am, but that's besides the point. My nick name at the hospital I worked at prior to going back to school was Dr. House, House, or Dr. Casa (I'm of Mexican descent),  so that'll tell you an idea of how I am especially to completely stupid people who hurt themselves and/or others in a very idiotic way, try their hardest to self diagnose, and/or treat themselves in horribly wrong ways.The only reason I still go is to keep harmony within the family and to see our niece.  That's pretty much why I still go. Happy wife, happy life... but there are times I just want to let loose and debate religion with my wife and her family members previously mentioned. But because I feel that if I did, Nana would essentially disown my wife and that would crush my wife beyond words. So I choose not to. It sort of makes me sad that I can't express my beliefs without the risk of destroying the family my wife has, which I envy because my family treats me like I'm dead because I married a Catholic woman in the Catholic Church. I was raised Mormon,  and apparently my having been deployed to Iraq then meeting my wife while deployed,  and then our moving in together shortly after I returned was not in my mom's plans for after I came back. The adverse reactions and effects it had on my relationship at the time and on the day of our wedding my entire family simply decided to unanimously decide to not come and essentially leave me alone at the alter all because she was Catholic was honestly the last straw which broke the camel's back and made me hate and reject god and religion,  and truly become an atheist. So yeah,  that's how it goes for me every Sunday.  Wake up, go to church, eat breakfast,  then I get to go back to Nana's house and do homework for however long I need to or help around her house because my wife and or mother-in-law will get pissed if I don't help out even though my wife's siblings and their now extended family get a free ride and are just left to be because "it's what they've always done and you can't expect them to change now do you?". So yeah that's life until Nana dies I guess.
24zhxt	-58974	1399497520	atheism	Memory from my NCO training course days.	Hello all and everybody. Just wanted to share a story from my young days while stationed in Okinawa, Japan during 04' - 06'.At this time in my life I was very curious about god, religion,  and different sects of Christianity.  This was due to being raised LDS and finally being away from home and able to explore my own beliefs. But I was still very indoctrinated in the LDS Christian belief system. I had researched Catholics, Judaism,  Buddhism,  Islam, other sects of Christians such as an obscure version of Christianity which observed and practiced faith healings. Which even at the time I felt were completely bullshit.Now onto the story. I had been sent by my Senior Chief to do the Junior NCO training especially since I had just picked up 3rd class, HM3.During one of the trainings talking about leadership and weapons handling, we were going over the flack jackets at the time. The Staff Sergeant teaching asked "What was and still is a resourceful and probably still one of the most dangerous weapons created by ancient man?"Knowing Marines and how bright some can be answers ranged from fire arms, knives,  cannons, bullets, one shouted "A Well Armed and Trained Marine,  Staff Sergeant! ". You know the usual shit.Then I answered, "Religion and God...", it was then the room sort of slowly fell silent. In which I elaborated shortly by saying,  "since the Crusades and maybe even further back I haven't researched that far yet, people have been fighting over and for the name of God because each group interprets the words of God differently,  even within themselves they fight. I feel it's one of the most prominent and dangerous weapons made by ancient man since it has been the driving force behind many of the conflicts,  even what's going on in Iraq right now."Staff Sergeant pretty much said, "Umm, well that's a good response I guess, but I was actually asking for bows and arrows as the answer. " this was because at this time arrows were still very easily able to go through body armour due to the hardened point which doesn't mushroom when it hits the vest. So they are still dangerous to us.After my comment,  I was sort of left alone and not really talked to any more by the Marines in the course so I simply took it as a sign to clam up and not mention religion, my findings,  and or opinions again.  So yeah that was my first time encountering what would somewhat be considered shunned for expressing my beliefs.
25c6es	-58974	1399872538	infertility	My damned life with infertility.	Hi all. This is actually the first time I've posted to this thread.  In fact I just found it about 20 minutes ago. Just wanted to get some shit off my chest. Be me: Doc Pyro. 28 y.o. male, combat veteran,  happily married to my wife for nearly 8 years now. Diagnosed with infertility since 2010. Over 2 dozen sperms analysis done since 2010 with all but the most recent results come back with a analysis of having shit, nada, and fucking nothing in it. Oh and for the most recent one,  guess what?  One..., yes count it 1!!! Fucking sperm noted. But not notes as to whether it was fucking motile, damaged,  deformed,  or anything so I count it as a bullshit Zero. Be my wife: Mamis,  27 y.o. female,  nursing student, and all around definition of awesome and loving. She is honestly my anchor,  she keeps me from drifting off into the horrible shit hole that is my mind that has been chronically fucked over since childhood. Don't be: Lil Bitch. Now 20 y.o. male. A useless, self entitled, lazy, thankless piece of shit who was a financial and psychological drain on Mamis, her mother Viejita,  and myself because he was kicked out of his own parents home for literally dropping out of high school with informing his parents,  pretending he was still going but instead spent his time getting high at another fucktards house. When his mom found out she booted him and was living on the streets under a bridge.  His mom asked us to take him in and hopefully straighten him out due to my military experience. That didn't happen,  as he continued his asshatery with us until we got feed up with him and booted him out.All the same fucking hateful,  hurtful,  and truly self loathing feelings have sprung up once again thanks to Mamis's cousin Lil Bitch having called us for the first time since we booted him over a year ago. He calls to say, no directly to us but to my wife's brother,  that, "Yeah, so are the Pyro's there?" "If not they'll hear it from you, don't really feel like talking to them anyways, so fuck it." "So yeah you know that girl I met a few months back to I moved in with?" "She's now pregos." "Fuck man, I fucked up." "Shit, oh well" tell them what's up bye."He out of all the most fucking idiotic morons on this fucking planet,  has conceived a child with a girl he barely met, whom has actually been supporting his truthfully dead beat and useless ass. It's honestly fucking killing me inside. While Mamis and I have been trying to get pregnant since 2009, he goes and stupidly knocks up some girl. He's not the only one, damn near everyone has had kids yet Mamis and I are stuck with no avail for the shit which I truly blame myself for. But it just infuriates me that morons like him in our families are popping out kids and are truly unable to provide for them. While Mamis and I can and want to do just that. Fuck it's the one thing I have wanted to do since I married Mamis. To be the one thing I know I would be great at because I had the shining example of what a fucking piece of shit father could be as my own.It truly hurts that I,  me, my fucking self can't get my own wife pregnant! I'm sorry for cursing and ranting and going off on some bullshit tangents.  Please don't leave messages about sending prayers my way because they're fucking useless.  I just rather have some help to what, if, any males who suffer from infertility and got a worthwhile treatment for this bullshit. Or at least a good general direction for a 100% disabled veteran and dependant wife could find some help to conceive a child of our own. Because I'm tired of this shit. I'm tired of being a old useless man to my wife and want to find a way to remedy this shut now.
25ltqh	-58974	1400133939	CorpsmanUp	More Sea Stories and shit I did. Accidentally posted it to a wrong sub, I'm retarded at some times.	Uuh Rah Devil Docs!Sorry I've been gone and quiet on this sub for a while.  You know the usual suspects after being discharged,  school,  wifey, family,  video games,  being a lazy civilian. You know shit like that.Welp since last we've met I've been accepted to the University of California Irvine (UCI). Woop woop! Gonna be me a doctor and poke people with things, mostly my cane I guess,  but woop woop!These be the Corps School Chronicles. Cast to include but not limited to:&gt; be me: Doc Pyro,  young, dumb, and stung by the tastes of good old alcohol after graduating Boot Camp, yes I was still in the old school ships, shows my age don't it.&gt; be best buddy: Mikey,  he fucking hated and still hates it when I call him like so. I still do it for shits and giggles.&gt; maybe not be: Heineken, had a name close to this, cool guys too.&gt; also maybe not be: Heine's girl, kinda remember her being a nice skinny blonde with bug boobs. (But who can really remember shit well after IEDs?)Random people who'll I'll mention in this story. &gt; random hotel girls and cab driver.Let's get this shot started! &gt; me in late 03' just got classed up at Corps School with class 04030 (this'll lead to other stories) and have already bought myself some new clothes,  yeah son stage 3 liberty, for those of you who came after my class I'm sorry, but that's another story for another time. Got invited by Heineken to hotel party at the "Jail House" so Mikey and I decide to get a cab with his ass and his newly acquired squeeze. &gt; Me: Sooooo where are we going again? &gt; Heine: Da mother fucking Jail House!  First of all we need booze!We grab a cab outside of the gate in good old Great Mistakes and are greeted by the cabby who was actually a bearded white guy, kinda looked like Santa. &gt; Santa Cabby: So where are you guys headed?&gt; Heine: To the Jail House but first stop over at the liquor shop.&gt; S.C.: No problem,  so who's 21?Fucking silence from us all...&gt; S.C.: Hmmm... fuck it you guys I'll buy it for ya!Excited hell yeahs all around from us so we then pool our monies together and tell him tequila, vodka,  and da Capt'n. He goes in and triumphantly comes out with all three and we head out to da Jail House.Once there we say our good byes to Santa Cabby and get a room, once inside we commence the drinking. As a bit of history for myself this was actually my first time in my life that I went out to a party to drink, yeah I was a dork and a lower in high school. Heineken pours me a tall fucking glass of a mixture of the 3 liquors we had acquired and a fucking bullshit single cube of ice.He then tells me to chug that shit. As I didn't want to look like a bitch and also being pretty beta so I then chugged it as fast and hard as I could. He then handed me a second,  I did the same, as you can see I got pretty fucked up very quickly. As the night went on I drank more and began to make some pretty fucking retarded decisions. I first hit on Heineken's girl continuously, actually to the point where he punched me in the chest. Caused me to gag and rush to throw up in the sink. &gt; Inebriated me: Fuck you man! She knows she want this badass beaner dick,  as I grab my junk and walk out of the room. (I discovered,  I became pretty dickish when very drunk from hard liquor).After this I don't remember what happened Mikey filled me in.I come back after some time missing my shirt, hit on Heineken's girl again... fucking dumbass me. Get punched again this time in the right side of my face, he said he took it easy on me because he hit me with his left. I then left again after another insult and saying I was gonna look for my shirt.Came back about an hour or two later looking fucking happy and stupid as a potato with a pinwheel. Had my shirt on buuuuuut, I was missing my fucking pants.As I entered the room guess what I did? Huh huh? Yep you guessed it I hit on Heineken's girl again, pantless and from what Mikey told me brandishing a hard on. He also told me I made this stupid ass flex and spin to show off which only made me nauseous which made me rush to the toilet and puke. After doing such I went back to Heineken's girl, well he had just had enough of my shit and punched me hard in the left side of my face and subsequently knocked my ass out.I slept on the floor that night... I remember waking up the next morning,  as Mikey stood over me laughing. &gt; Me: What the shit happened last night? Mikey told me the events which transpired,  I wondered where my fucking pants were,  he didn't know. After that I apologized to Heineken and his girl, he said it's good he hit me so it evens out.I then went door to door asking if my pants were in there. Got through about 5 doors before I got to a door which was answered by an ok cute girl in a white Tee and pinkish colored panties.&gt; Random girl:  Hey you're back!&gt; me: Ummmm... yeah I think, are my pants in here?She then smiles turns around and walks into the room. She and two other girls come to the door, first one is skinny and flat all around and the other kinda chubby but cute face they're all holding different pairs of pants.&gt; Random girl: which one was yours again?&gt; Me grabbing the pair out of the chubby girl's hand: these ones thanks. Ummm... I have a question? What exactly happened last night?&gt; Random girl smiles: oh you know the usual.She then closes the door and I'm left in the hallway dazed and confused as to what exactly happened the night before. I put my pants back on and go straight back to the room with the Mikey and Heineken, told them what just happened and we left to go eat at IHOP. Yeah that's the end of this story so i hoped you enjoyed it and have fun.
25lvsg	-58974	1400136264	fatpeoplestories	Did you know there is a sub that's called:	
25zvxl	-58974	1400552652	atheism	One of the reasons I don't believe in any religion is because I'm immortal.	Yes you read it immortal,  but I only say this jokingly because since I've died when I was 13 years old I've lived through every single life threatening event of my life. Well let's start with when I died, I was a 13 year young little shit, raised Mormon, very religious step mom and a somewhat religious father. My dad was a military school raised Mexican was trained as his platoons medic,  who ran away from a Mexico City military school the age of 14 and made it to the us at age 16. He was honestly one of the most horrible people who has ever lived.  He was a drug dealer, a pimp, gang member, great manipulator,  lier,  theif, and fathered an unknown number of bastards. Apparently the only reason he stuck around for me after he refused I was his child for the first 2 years of my life was because he one wanted to hurt my bio mother, and learned from his cop buddies he could be paid to  have possession of me by the state.He had his cop buddies find my mom after she got off work while disguised,  they beat her to a pulp and sent her the the hospital.  The most horrible thing was they even visited her in uniform at the hospital to "get a description of the perpetrators" as they began to fuck with her IV,  which caused it to blow her vein. When she showed up to the hearing for custody for me she still had bruises and a visibly blown vein and said that was evidence that it was unsafe for be to be cared for by her and that she was still a drug user.Long story short she lost custody of me because of that. But as I grew up, I never knew her because my father kept her away by threatening her with simply picking me up and disappearing and making it so she would never know where I was and never see me again.  Which with this threat actually drove her into a deep depression, which caused her to turn to and rely on heavy duty drugs and narcotics to alleviate the pain she was in.He then began his long use of psychological warfare, which included physical, emotional, and psychological abuse on me simply cause I looked like my mom more than I looked like him. But he did teach me some things. Such as how to lie, cheat, and steal. He taught me how to steal from a store and hot wire a car by the time I was 11.I remember working with him as he was a self trained "electrician". He taught me how to strip wire, reconnect,  rewire, etc. I was working on some wires outside of his friend's house. His buddy needed to turn the circuit breaker back on to test and work on something.  Didn't call out and simply flipped it on.My dad said he heard my toolbox hit the ground, called out to me heard nothing so he went to check out what had happened. He said he saw me standing on a step ladder and holding on to two wires. He realized what happened picked up a 2x4 and hit me across the chest/stomach. He then began to search for a pulse and see if I was breathing, I had neither of the two. He then began doing caveman CPR by beating on my chest,  shaking me, slapping me, and yelling at me to wake up.After about 4 to 5 minutes of being dead, I somehow woke up, I know as a medical professional the astronomically low chances an individual has of revival from just CPR, especially when done wrong. I remember only darkness,  nothing more nothing less, then pain in my hands to my chest and abdomen. I remember a fucking splitting headache,  and him laying on me as he was shaking me and yelling at me. That was it. No light,  no tunnel,  no heaven,  no hell, simply silence and darkness.  Since then, I've been hit by a bus once.Jumped by 10 guys with chains, bats,  steel toe boots,  and a knife because one of them thought I was trying to steal his girl.Stabbed twice.Hit by 4, yes physically hit by 4 cars. Two of them more recently. Not including those previously mentioned,  been in 3 civilian car accidents,  two of which where the car were smashed to shit.Shot at by gang members because they didn't know how to aim their fucking weapons at the dude 10 feet in front of my friend and I.Thrown out of a two story window at a bar in Japan,  as a fight between some Army personnel and my Marines had happened which pulled me in. I was kicked out of the window by an Ooh Ah (Army) and landed on the ground below, I don't remember if on my head. Was carried to my room by my Marines afterwards.Lived through a stupidly self induced alcoholic coma which lasted 3 days. I woke up in my room with an IV in each arm, a Foley in my dick and a buddy sleeping next to me on my couch as it was his shift to watch him me.Blown up 3 times while in Iraq.Shot at by a sniper 4 times.And to top it off, didn't die with what I consider my most successful suicide attempt since the age of 7. Yes 7, I was suicidal since the tender age of 7. That's what psychological warfare does to a kid. I had been in Iraq for 4 months now, had just came back from emergency leave for my eldest brothers funeral. I had my step grandmother, eldest brother,  and two of my Marines die, blown up 3 times, found the remains of 11 individuals who had been executed,  and shot at by a sniper 4 times in a 4 month period,  not to include the sudden death if my father about a month after this event. I felt because of my religious and horrible upbringing from my father that all this death,  pain, and suffering which I had experienced in such a short period of time was because"God" hated me and was punishing me for the fun of it. I felt that he couldn't kill me so he started going after my friends and family in order to get me to kill myself. I felt as if he succeeded,  I had just returned from yet another convoy late in the evening, I simply walked out of my barracks,  no one questioned because hell after all this shit, they mostly left me alone as they taught I needed some time to grieve. I walked out with my M9, which wasn't usual because we had to have on us at all times anyways. I walked into a nearby dried up riverbed full of tall and dried up grass,  got on my knees, made sure my M9 was loaded,  racked back the slide, ensured the safety was off and placed the end of the barrel on my right temple. I pulled the trigger.I still remember that fucking click so fucking vividly even to today. I remember after that damned click, being there thinking, "is this the part where time slows down and my life flashes before my eyes?" I remember after an unknown amount of time,  finally realizing that my weapon had misfired. I remember bringing it down from my temple, and stated at the weapon for a long time simply stunned from what had just happened. I remember dropping my M9 and curling myself into a ball then crying to myself and yelling at "god" asking, "why didn't he just let me do it?", "why can't he kill me himself?,  "why am I alive?", "was it for his entertainment?", "did he enjoy seeing me in pain?".After some time,  I got back up and walked back to the barracks without anyone there knowing of what had happened. They never found out.  Hell it took 3 years to actually tell this story to my wife and her family,  and this was after my nervous break down which had followed another suicide attempt as I had sat on the edge of a cliff leading to the ocean and rocks below, which was close to her sister's apartment. I nearly jumped but didn't. Since then, after becoming a skeptic,  then agnostic,  then an atheist,  now ultimately an anti-theist. I've been hit by two cars, I ride my bike 8 miles to and from school almost everyday.  Those two cars which both damaged my bikes beyond repair. So yeah, as of right now, I jokingly say I'm immortal to my wife and her family. I also tell them that "Death" and I have an arrangement,  he doesn't mess with me and I don't make fun of him for all his failures when it comes to me.Also as of now most of the people I consider family doesn't know I'm an anti-theist,  except for my step mom and my brother in law. I think my wife has figured out that I no longer believe in any religion, any god, and or any religious beliefs/scriptures. Edit:So yeah... you have just read the short description of my relatively short life which has been horribly experienced in pain, misery, death. Also since my nervous breakdown and several other experiences which have lead to my anti-theism,  I'm no longer suicidal so that's a plus. TLDR: I'm immortal since I died at the age of 13.

26xz7z	-58974	1401523227	atheism	My niece told me this today...	So my 5 y.o. niece told me and my wifw today after my wife and I had picked her up from her very Catholic School in San Pedro,  CA. While we were waiting in line for sandwiches from a local establishment around there, that her elementary school teacher had told her and her class that dinosaurs were not real... I asked what she thought her teacher meant or at least if her teacher explained her view more as if they never existed at all. My niece said, "Yeah she said dinosaurs weren't real and never existed. " where both my wife and I looked at each other and I blatantly and straight forward told her her teacher was wrong,  in fact very wrong. That dinosaurs were in fact real, had actually existed, we know because of all the fossils that remained of them. She asked what were fossils so I had to explain those to her. Also I told her that all dinosaurs were dead but their descendants still exist. Had to explain what a descendant was. She then asked, "Really? You sure? You mean like lizards and snakes?" I told her no actually,  Birds, birds evolved from dinosaurs. She got all bright eyes and excited and said "You mean like in pokemon!?! With pikachu!?!" I laughed for a second seeing her excitement, "No mamas, no, not exactly like in pokemon,  where a single creature changes into another animal,  it takes a long time and many many many families to come and go and for babies to be born a then those babies to grow up and have babies and so on for evolution to happen. She became sort of awestruck by what I had told her and became silent over the issue for a while.  She later asked after we had eaten,  which was odd because I had observed a new behavior from her due to her teacher, who said anything the your saliva touches is now very dirty and you shouldn't touch it again because saliva is extremely dirty. So my wife and I as logical and studious individuals and going into the medical field as a nurse and D.O. told her her teacher was wrong again and that saliva wasn't very dirty, it could lead to the spread of certain diseases like the flu but overall it was good for you especially when you eat.But after that we had stopped at a park behind where her mom works to hang out and play while waiting for her mom to come off her shift. She asked, "Nani?" (My nickname she calls me, it's what she used to say when she originally tried to call me Nino, and it just stuck,  I actually like it more than Nino (godfather).) Me, "Yes Mamas?". She, "why do you and Nina say that Ms. Cooper is wrong? She's a teacher." I told her, "well its because she is, there is a lot of evidence and proof to support that dinosaurs existed and were real and your Nina and I know that saliva can be good because of what we've learned in college and from when Nani was in the Navy and he and Nina used to work in the hospital. "She, "But she's my teacher,  I'm supposed to listen to her." I, "I understand mamas, but I'll tell you something, whenever you hear something,  anything that is taught to you always question it okay. Always try to find the proof or at least some evidence to support it so that you aren't left with wrong information okay." She's all like, "Okays Nani! But why was she wrong?" I told her that, "It's probably because she's an elementary teacher so she doesn't need to have a very strong background in advanced science." She, "oh, okay... let's go on the playground now." "OK mamas let's go." We played for about a half hour and she went with her mom shortly after. It sort of irritated me that b.s. like that is being taught in some schools although she is in a Catholic School at least teach real shit. My niece is already indoctrinated into the Catholic faith thanks to all powerful and never wrong Nana (her great grandmother). But I as hard as I can not to reveal my atheism to my niece or to Nana as it may cause Nana to make me distance myself from my niece out of fear of the horrible and evil devil worshipping atheist. If that happened I'd probably lose it because of how much I love mah mamas. But I have been sort of teaching some critical thinking skills to her in hopes she uses them to become smarter in her school studies and hopefully help her realize the church is nothing but fairytales.Well rant over. TLDR,Nieces' Catholic elementary school teacher tells her dinosaurs never existed and my wife and I had to correct that knowledge.

27tjny	-58974	1402434422	atheism	"So, is heaven for real?"	Hello and what's up everyone. This is an A.M.A. which is being done by request of U/Matrix9. Sorry for the wait, got a little sidetracked. Some back story, I'm a 28 y.o. male combat veteran, nearly a decade as a U.S. Navy Fleet Marine Force Hospital Corpsman and I've been an atheist since last September.Now on to why the A.M.A., I've died, yes I have been dead, when I was 13 y.o. I was electrocuted while working with my dad who was an "electrician", he taught me how to strip, rewire, etc.So, I was helping my dad while he was working on one of his friends' house, who incidentally was working with us at the time. He needed to use something powered up to work on something, so he flipped the circuit breaker back on without asking or alerting anyone. Unbeknownst to him, I was outside rewiring something outside, I think it was a new lightning set or some shit along those lines,  so yeah.He simply went to work on whatever it was he needed to do. My dad had heard my toolbox fall and called out to me but no response. He went out to check on me and then saw that I was holding on to the wires motionless. He instantly knew what happened and slammed me in the chest with a 2x4. Afterwards he checked for a pulse and if I was breathing, after seeing I had none he began doing caveman CPR, simply by slamming on my chest, slapping me, and shaking me while yelling at me to wake up. Yeah that sounded like it was fun. After about 5 minutes of doing this I was revived, yeah I know as a medical professional that the chances of some being revived without the assistance of an A.E.D. is slim to none especially with improperly done CPR, but yeah it happened.Now what I remember from this experience from while I was dead, was darkness, nothing, and sheer unconsciousness. Nothingness, that was it. No images of a long tunnel or white light, no images of the gates of heaven or flames of hell. This was a lasting impression on my since the age of 13.Due to having been raised LDS, I was very deeply Christian and indoctrinated. But my beliefs had been constantly wavered and the curiosity of what had happened that day kept eating at me. Oddly enough, since dying, I have essentially been immortal or at least very difficult to kill. Shocked twice more, shot at by gang members, jumped twice by gang members, stabbed twice, been in 3 car accidents which pretty much totaled the vehicles, hit by 3 cars (2 of them very recently), hit by a bus (my fault), blown up 3 times by I.E.D.s, had shrapnel fly past me as I was knocked down from a blast which engulfed two of my Marines in a ball of flame and shrapnel, shot at by a sniper 4 times, and lasting had my weapon misfire when I tried to end my own life by putting a bullet through my right temple.So please ask me anything, I'll be as honest as possible.

As the title states I'm looking for info.Pretty much am looking for everything I can learn/know about the majority if not all of the origins/purpose of the major beliefs, rituals, prayers, history, "history", etc.I'm open to reading long sources of text if provided.The reason is that I would like to know far more about the church as my wife is Catholic.I've tried to learn as much as I can from her and her family to understand their faith but none of them really know why any of is done, they just do it without question. I would like to know this as source info so I may know and understand their beliefs more, this is since I was raised Mormon I know the basic tenants of Christianity as well as the Mormon church.Examples to helpful and credible links to several of the questions I hold would include: When was the Pentecost, why was that day chosen, who started the church?Why exactly do you do palm Sunday and when did it start?What is ash Wednesday, why was it started, who started it, and why do you do it?Why do you fast, what is good Friday, why is it good?Why in the living fuck do you not consider fish as "meat",  when you Damn well know the definition for meat is the muscular fibers of a living Fucking animal?Sorry about the last one, I swear that one annoys the shit out of me.Thank you.Edit: Palabras.

Question guys.When it comes to the very well known name of YHWH, Yahweh, God, Allah, Elihom, etc. and/or whatever else he's called.Wouldn't the original have had a V in place of the W in his name, since most ancient languages didn't have if I remember correctly no real letter for W sounds existed yet, thus the V.So his name would of been spelled YHVH, probably pronounced Yah-Veh, like key in Spanish.What you guys think, or is this something that's been discussed before?

2pmg88	-58996	1418856546	Paranormal	One of the stranger experiences I've had.	When I was about 7 or 8 we had a fire place with one of those stone ledges in front that you could stack wood or sit on. One afternoon I was kneeled in front of that playing with my action figures, as a fire my dad started burned out. After awhile the fire was no more than smoldering pieces if wood and ash. It was at this point that something caught my eye in the far left corner.What I saw was a pile of ash raise straight up into the form of a spider. Not just any spider either, this thing was almost half the height of the the fire place and just as wide. I spent a lot of time in front of that fire place and have seen the ashes do a lot funny things, so at first I thought I was just looking at some cool pattern the ashes happened to make. That's when it walked to the other side of the fire place, and collapsed back down into nothing. When I say It walked, I mean each leg moved independently. I had learned all about spiders a year or so before, and made sure all the parts were there. I ran to my dad and of course he dismissed it. I have no doubt that if he witnessed what I did, it wouldn't have been so easy.

Turns out that it wasn't but my mom was then hit by our train coming in. The train slowly came to a stop and had 1940's style American soldiers hanging out of the windows and off of the sides waving. They stopped at a group of women of the same style, but they all had there faces painted with glossy white paint, and exaggerated make up over top. One that stood out was a woman with her face painted only below her nose, and a giant lipstick smile. The soldiers eventually got off and we got on. We got to New York but I woke up before we ever left the station.

The cravings were pretty bad at first, and then they have tapered off.  I still get them occasionally but not as bad as they were day 1 or 2.  I was always a pretty healthy guy even when I was smoking.  I work out like 5-6 times a week so, I'm not too worried about the gaining weight part but I have been keeping a closer eye on it.  Other than that, I've noticed I don't tire as easily as I used to.  My overall energy level is up and I can take much deeper breaths which feels awesome.

jsa4q	-59012	1314143149	offmychest	Just need to write it down right now	That old adage again: when it rains, it pours. I'm so stressed right now that I'm shaking as I type this. Work is piling up; I'm probably going to have to work 15 hours again tonight but instead, I'm typing this. What the fuck am I doing? Grandpa is dying. Probably another 24 hours until he's gone. I was never really that close with him but when I was a teen, I treated him like shit. I remember he would come in for a hug or a kiss or some sign of affection and I would push him away. I was young at the time, but I always regret that. Problem was I felt like I could never tell him because of a language barrier (my chinese is fucking awful). I need to fly out to San Francisco for his services later this week but I really don't have the financial means to do this and I'm too proud to ask my family for assistance since I just moved. My chest feels impacted, like a hollowed grapefruit. My heart is breaking for all the family I have over on the west coast that have to see him whittle away into non-existence. I hurt right now. I know I have to get this deadline done for work but I feel so distracted. I can't focus. My mom is flying in from Taiwan later today. I feel lost.

People were advocating for the teacher to be fired based on the story provided by the OP.  It sounded to me like people were looking for blood instead of actually thinking about the situation.  I don't think the ad in question could or should be considered "disgusting," but it isn't an "insidious form of homophobia" to be disgusted by two men kissing (especially since they aren't the greatest looking guys).  I think it that this reaction is simply the nature of heterosexuality. I think materialdesigner might be more correct by calling it ignorance (as I did myself), but ignorance is fought through education, not firing teachers because for their knee-jerk reactions.  Educating people is what I was advocating for elsewhere in the comments.I really don't see what it is that I did wrong as I was respectful the whole time, and was NEVER homophobic.

And then when something improtant happens he starts talking even faster then normal and changes his voice tone into this really weird annoying sounding thing that I cant stand.

Can we have an option to turn off the jungle/lane directional signs, for someone who knows the map they are completely unnecessary. Edit : answer found

2z6usp	-59034	1426472387	ColoradoAvalanche	Upcoming Avalanche Free Agents	Obviously the seasons not over yet and I am pulling for us to sneak into the playoffs but I have been looking at our upcoming free agents and am interested in what you guys think we will do.Free agents after this Season that have played at least 1 NHL Game:Daniel Briere $4M (UFA)Jan Hejda $3.25M (UFA)Ryan Wilson $2.375 (UFA)Joey Hishon $0.85M (RFA)Stefan Elliott $0.85M (RFA)Calvin Pickard $0.81M (RFA)Freddie Hamilton $0.625M (RFA)Jordan Carron $0.6M (RFA)Tomas Vincour $0.6M (RFA)Andrew Agozzino $0.6M (RFA)Not Likely to sign:Daniel Briere ($4M), even if he doesn't retire I just don't see any reason the Avs resign him, and certainly not for $4M.Ryan Wilson ($2.375M), Wilson has been extremely injury prone for a few seasons now and his roll of 7th D man has been filled in nicely be Zach Redmond for 1/3 the price.Likely Resign:Calvin Pickard($0.810M) I think pretty much everyone wants Pickard resigned, I'm curious to see what kind of a contract he will get as it's obvious the NHL potential is there but he is not fully proven yet.Freddie Hamilton ($0.625M), Jordan Carron ($0.600), Safe to assume we will want to resign them since we traded for them, I expect hamilton to get a similar contract to what he has now to be used as a depth forward. Carron is a bit more interesting, depending on what the Avs future plans are for it's hard to gauge exactly what that contract will look like, based on his past results I can't expect he will get a big raise but if the avs expect him to fill talbot's shoes and be an every night player we may see a 1 year contract giving him a chance to prove himself.Andrew Agozzino ($0.6M), The avs gave him a chance earlier in the year to play his first NHL game so I imagine they want to hold on to him as he continues to develop.Question Marks:Jan Hejda ($3.25M), I think the Avs want to resign hejda and I think they may be able to get him cheaper then his current contract but there is a huge Demand for solid D men in the league right now and as an UFA you never know what someone might offer him.Joey Hishon ($0.850M) I think the Avs want to resign him but I'm not completely convinced they should. His development has been side tracked by injuries and just as he seemed to be recovering and getting his chance to play in the NHL he gets injured again.Stefan Elliott ($0.850): I just don't see a place for him on the Avs, Barrie took his spot years ago and we have Seimens and Bigras in the pipe for next year, We even brought him up near the Trade deadline perhaps to try and trade him but he didn't impress anyone. I suspect he's ready to try to crack a line up elsewhere.Tomas Vincour ($0.600M), He quietly played 7 games for us early this year when we got struck by injury but his contract just seems strange, a 1 year $600,000 contract not sure what to make of it.Losing Briere and Wilson Frees up a bit over $6 million if we get Hejda a bit cheaper we can end up around $6.5 million, some of that is going to go to pickard and possibly Carron even still we should have the space left over to go out and pick up a real top 4 dman if they are available.

If you entered any redemption codes at that time, please make sure they are showing on your account and reenter them if need be as they may not have registered. The new server allows us to have a more robust system that will have increased alerts and warnings to eliminate issues like this in the future. And we chose to make this upgrade at a time when we have the fewest pending redemptions in recent years with less than 9,000 waiting on fulfilment. Most of that number is waiting on athletes to return their cards to us which our Athlete Relations team is actively pursuing. We apologize for the inconvenience.this has spanned a lot more redemptions then just the time frame they stated as well, many people are missing redemptions from much earlier in the year.

2aseqi	-59036	1405451957	Accounting	What's your experience with "Sports Talk" with your peers?	**Disclaimer:** Sorry this is not about accounting but rather the day to day that many of those on this subreddit (public accounting) must experience. It's a big part of my job.**Background:** Male. Big 4 Assurance. Mid-sized city. Played basketball in high school. **Issue:** I cannot stand how there is an *widespread expectation* of people to know about and participate in conversations about every single piece of *sports news, scores, trades, and general facts etc.* I like sports but it drives me nuts how all the guys (and even women) are expected to keep up with all of these things and if you don't, you are almost exiled from conversation and seen as inferior in a way. It feels like they prefer to not even try to relate to others on a personal level for the hobbies that they like. Instead, there's this sports *fixation* where most of those talking only like sports because they were once in my position and decided to just "fit in". Most of it is just regurgitation of articles from espn. I like the people I work with but assuming it truly is their main interest why is not just occasional, but instead almost every free moment we have?**Feedback?** What do you do at the office/client? Embrace it? Find it easy since you enjoy it? Ignore it? Steer the conversation away (in what way?)? Hate it?Thanks!

I quickly looked down my spreadsheet and she was by far the best price!I don't know if that's the case nationally but I was impressed and the price is great for me. Couldn't hurt to call but U Haul seems to be the low cost provider.PS My home improvement stores did not offer anything.
2e692p	-59036	1408623106	Accounting	CPA Exam Scores - Becker vs. Actual	**TLDR: If you got a 63 or higher on Becker, you probably passed the Actual.**In lue of the score releases today, I figured this was a good time to post this. Using data from Another71 + a few friends of mine + some of you guys, I have compiled a spreadsheet of how well people do on the actual CPA exam versus on the final exams Becker provides. This is at the following link:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18h1_IfOBv04SjkKDqUkzcjoj2OdXGMc_hxqot7N2u9w/edit?usp=sharing If you scroll down, you can see a summary section I compiled at the bottom, highlighted in yellow. Note that most of those polled had passed the exam so it may be skewed a little. Interestingly enough, as it stands, each exam has roughly the same increase of about 12-13 points.The main conclusion is that if you get around a 63 on the Becker exams, you are most likely going to pass the actual exam (75 or higher). I would not recommend aiming for this as your goal however - just listen to Becker!Let me know if you have any thoughts. For many of you this might be a relief as you wait for your score today.Enjoy!

ecruv	-59044	1290927030	politics	A criticism of the DREAM Act that I don't think has been raised by media or the politicians.	While I support what the DREAM Act is trying to accomplish, I do have one big criticism of the proposed act that I have haven't yet seen.If you haven't heard, the DREAM Act proposes to allow illegal immigrants who have gotten a high school diploma or equivalent, with a few other criteria, to get on a path towards citizenship after getting a 2-4 year degree from an accredited university or by joining the military. The bill is coming up for a vote this Monday.My criticism has to do with people getting post-secondary degrees in exchange for citizenship. If the DREAM Act passes, these individuals will be eligible to receive Federal Student Loans from the government. While the media and politicians aren't really paying attention to it, far too many of us here on reddit know that the post-secondary education system is fucked up right now. It is totally dependent on dollars from the government in the form of those same student loans. And there are more and more predatory for-profit colleges opening every year, who are willing to soak up those loans in exchange for a worthless degree.My worry is that there will be a large amount of people who, in the pursuit of citizenship, will sign up at one of the hundreds of "diploma-mill" universities to get a degree that isn't worth the paper it is printed on, further watering down the market for college graduates. And they will have 2-4 years worth of Federal loans to go along with it. And make no mistake, if this bill passes there will be plenty of for-profit schools that will recruit these kind of students because they know they will be eligible for loans and looking for a path to citizenship.I want to reiterate that I am not against these people receiving citizenship. I'm not even against them going to college. If all of the potential candidates had the grades to go to a state school or community college where the tuition is cheaper and the education still worth something, I would be in favor of this Act. But I think we all know that this isn't the case.  I don't want to force these to take on massive amounts of debt to get a worthless degree just to get citizenship, and still be stuck with a low-paying job. There has to be a better way for these people to get citizenship.

ed2hz	-59044	1290992332	writing	Hey writeit, could you help a new writer to get started on a novel?	Hey there guys, I have lurked this subreddit for a little while and this is my first post here. Since I've had more free time on my hands recently, I have decided that I want to start working on a novel. I am not necessarily looking to make the big bucks or anything (although I wouldn't mind), but I do want to try and complete one just so I can say I have done it.My problem is that I am not very good at organizing my thoughts for such a long piece. I was always a pretty good writer in college, but I rarely if ever used the outline formulas and organizing techniques that they drill into your head in high school. I just didn't seem to need to, even on 10-20 page papers. But now that I am trying to get my ideas together for a much longer piece, I am finding that a lot of those organizing techniques fall short anyways.So I was wondering what you guys would suggest to get started. I have heard that a lot of folks like to put their ideas on a notecards and pin them to a wall. I have also heard of writing detailed character biographies as to flesh out all of the characters before they are even introduced in the story.If any of you guys can give me any advice or suggestions from your experience on starting new projects, I would greatly appreciate it.

Not to mention the fact that your taxes at least in part are used to facilitate the lifestyles of the Queen and the rest of the Royal Family.With that being said, what is your take on the issue? Are you guys scared of creating another Cromwell? Is there a difference in opinion on the monarchy if you are Scottish, Welsh, or Irish (Northern of course) instead of English?Thanks for your responses.

1bgzmf	-59044	1364858805	self	Who else thinks that Reddit's April Fools prank is really fucking stupid?	Do the Reddit admins realize that they have made the [123rd ranked website globally](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com) basically unusable for a day? I was not too ticked by the changes until I tried to read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1bfwjo/china_mobilizing_troops_jets_near_korea/) thread about the Chinese army moving to the North Korean border. Too bad I couldn't read it because of all the dumb fucking hats and edited comments. WWIII, no big deal. It's April Fools Day everybody!I think it is time for the admins to wise up and stop pulling shit like this every year. The servers have a hard time working during peak times usually, and they have clearly been struggling with dealing with this bullshit all day. Things that happen on reddit end up being published in [major](http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/03/31/olive-garden-gives-family-a-free-meal-after-grandpas-house-burns-down/) [news](http://news.yahoo.com/how-reddit-s-ask-me-anything-became-part-of-the-mainstream-media-circuit--130755591.html) [sources](http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-03-05/lifestyle/37467776_1_anonymity-commenters-internet). Not to mention the fact that reddit has been used as a news aggregator in times of emergency (like Hurricane Sandy) and tragedy (Sandy Hook). What if something terrible happened today? There are a lot of people that use reddit as their primary or only news source, and they wouldn't be able to use it for that purpose on a day like today.How many websites do you see that basically shut down the entire functionality of their website for a day? It is one thing to have a joke, but this is a step-too-far. I have a great idea for an April Fools joke for 2014. **Make reddit work without issue.** No one will see it coming.

2070tf	-59044	1394590590	TrueDetective	[SPOILERS] My theories on the wider conspiracy	So I have been thinking about the larger conspiracy aspect of the show with the Tuttle clan and I think that I have come up with a good idea of how this all played out.First off, I have to say that I am kinda glad the wide conspiracy didn't get resolved in the finale, because it allows us to imagine what happened later. Maybe another detective will follow up on Rust and Marty's work and finally try to take down the whole family. Who knows.Anyway, I think that the Tuttle cult stems at least from the time of the patriarch Sam Tuttle if not longer. This guy was clearly a pedophile who had no compunctions with having sex with his own progeny. This is the environment that Errol, Reggie, Dewall, and even Gov./Sen. Tuttle and Rev. Tuttle grew up in. The cult of the Yellow King either already existed or continued to exist during this time. Maybe the Yellow King is a title that is passed down through the generations, or just a focus of worship for the cult.Throughout the middle of the century, the cult is still going strong. Eventually Rev. Tuttle sets up the Wellsprings program as a "farm system" to target and gather victims for the cult. During this time, many members of the family are involved including the Reverend, the Governor, with Errol and his crew acting as the muscle.Somewhere between the murder of Marie Fontenot and the murder of Dora Lange, things change for the cult. Maybe some of the older members die off, or the more powerful members like Gov. Tuttle and the Reverend become too afraid of the possible consequences as they are getting even more powerful in the state. The Wellsprings program is shut down and the files are dealt with. At this point the high profile members of the cult lay low and don't participate in the cult any longer. Carcosa and the Tuttle estate begin to fall into shambles.However, Errol and his acolytes/cousins Reggie and Dewall continue to abduct and murder kids on their own. Errol either inherits the title of the Yellow King or becomes its lead priest if you will. He kills Dora Lange and leaves her to be found because, unlike the other members of the cult, he is proud of his "work" and wants people to bear witness to it.Rust and Marty pick up the case and almost immediately the task force is set up. The remaining high-profile members of the cult know exactly who did this and try to get the murder pushed under the rug like the other abductions over the years. They get lucky when Reggie and Dewall go down for the crime and think this has blown over. For some reason, they do not tie off the loose end that is Errol, either out of respect, fear, or some perverse sense of loyalty.Fast forward to 2010. Errol is still killing but is keeping it secret for now. Rust starts to find clear evidence of the spread of the conspiracy with the discovery of the old tape in Rev. Tuttle house. Rev. Tuttle falls into despair due to the fact that someone has his dirty laundry, and informs the other high-profile former members of the cult of the robbery. Unlike Errol, the cult members don't find the Rev. a physical threat or fear more the idea of him turning himself in or otherwise being blackmailed and exposed so they have him killed.They hope this is the end of the story, but Errol decides to show his face again with more murders that he intends to be found. Luckily for the former cult members, Errol is killed and is then able to be used as a fall guy for all of the cults actions for decades, even though he has been acting on his own for only 20 or so years of that.Anyway, that's what I'm thinking. Let me know what you guys think.

1f3r8w	-59049	1369607558	books	Help me remember a book series I read a long time ago based on a description of the cover and general details	On the cover of every book in the series was a series of square crystals (I think there were seven of them but I don't remember for sure) down the right side of the cover. The first/top crystal was red I believe. The first book I believe had a boy on the cover. I think the crystals took the characters to a magic land, I think one per character. The third crystal (which I think might have been blue? I'm not sure) was given to a girl on accident, or somehow she was evil or mischievous or something, or maybe that was some kind of prophecy or something.Does this sound familiar to anyone? Thanks for your help.

I've got time to kill today and some of the rest of this week and am in a keen Rainmeter-ing mood. The first idea that someone suggests that sounds cool, feasible, not absurdly complicated but unique enough to be novel and interesting, I'll try to whip it up today or in the next week. I'll also thoroughly comment the code and provide a brief synopsis of how I made it once it's done for others to learn from. Or, if an idea sounds cool but pretty complex, and if someone else wants to tag-team, we can try to community brainstorm/collaborate on a new skin that people want to use.Mods: If this is somehow against the rules, let me know. This is meant to be solicited requests, to sharpen my skills and help out/give feedback to the community. I'm not trying to support "freeloading."

(Please do)**Yup!**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**Primarily weekend gaming. Web browsing and movie watching, too. I want to be able to move this around, and potentially even fly with it in my carry-on (hence the SFF).**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**I'm wanting to maintain stable 60 FPS @ 1440p on very high settings. To play at 2160p would be cool, but I think that's more of a hype train than it's worth to me.**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**Goal is &lt;$1500 for the PC, plus planning for ~$300+ for peripherals (monitor, speakers, keyboard [I have a mouse already]). Total for everything &lt;$2000.**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**US.**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp)**Drafted build:http://pcpartpicker.com/p/8VTWLk  Alternative configuration for an ATX rig that I also considered. Leaning toward the SFF for portability and smaller footprint, but your input is welcomed:http://pcpartpicker.com/p/kDLk3C**Provide any additional details you wish below.**I already have a OCZ Arc 100 240GB, so the one in the build is to then RAID 0 the pair. Am I better off just getting a single, better SSD, or go with this RAID 0 pair of inexpensive but mediocre SSDs?**NOTE: You do not have to follow this format, but please be sure to answer these questions. Please do not ask to simply be given a build. You are welcome to delete this section.**

1iual7	-59069	1374529294	eagles	Will Tajh Boyd be the next Donovan McNabb?	Hey guys, I made this it's own post because there isn't a ton of activity in the comment sections of /r/Eagles to begin with, so I'd get even fewer replies.Anyway, McNabb is my all time favorite NFL player and I watched him nearly his whole career. I've watched Boyd since his sophomore season. Aside from the inflated states that Boyd has because of his heavy pass oriented offense, I find the way that the two play to be very comparable. Boyd is built similarly, though shorter, to McNabb. Boyd goes through his progressions like McNabb. He is one of the few pass oriented, very intelligent black QBs that I have seen in awhile. He seems to be miles ahead of Cam Newton in the ability to read defenses and I don't find him very comparable to RG3 due to his lack of explosiveness.Maybe I'm grasping at air, but I'd love to see another black pocket QB like McNabb be successful. I'm pretty tired of seeing so many of them flob out because of their inability to pass. I think Boyd will be different.Thoughts?

Just wanted to say thanks for the feedback, comments, and overall interaction. This is the first thing I've contributed to /r/CFB, and I did scour every schedule from the top 25 to create it and took into consideration rivalries, NC implications, and tradition, as well as which matchups I just found most intriguing. Thank you for the 9 up votes, that's more than I ever expected. And here's to a great season! Go Ducks!
1lfzi4	-59069	1377920653	CFB	Should James Franklin be held accountable for the actions of the four former Vanderbilt players involved in the rape case and the other player that has been suspended by the team?	Vanderbilt is often touted as an institution of high morals and prestige, like Northwestern and Stanford, but do the recent actions of these players sully the name of Vanderbilt and head coach James Franklin to the point that we should no longer consider it a 'clean' program?

In the eyes of the evaluators and scouts at the camp, many saw Mangum as the most talented prospect.However, Mangum is a Mormon and ended up attending BYU, choosing to delay his football career to perform missionary work. This past July, he left for Chile on a two year mission. He plans, as of now, to return to football.Will he be successful?Here's a link to an interview from late 2011, notice that he does note it will be three years before he plays:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBnV-OfEdtA

Most of the time I question why I ever got the game, oh right because Bungie has never let us down before, they always had the community first and wanted what was best for players.Every weekly update I have read since the game came out has essentially told us, the people who buy the game, are playing it wrong. Most of our opinions not related to PVP are ignored and the things that should get fixed, never do."Welcome to Destiny" says the developer "You WILL play how WE want."

2xrz4m	-59072	1425381436	AgainstGamerGate	Something Said by Yahtzee of The Escapist That Makes a Lot of Sense.	From his article in Extra Punctuation: If You Are Going to Hate a Game Company, Do It For the Right Reasons."I personally take the view that the over-representation of male game protagonists stems from an over-representation of male creators in the triple-A industry. And while one could certainly find individual cases of misogyny in action, I think the broader explanation is that less women are game designers for the same reason that less men are fashion editors: they are less likely to consider it an option because of societal gender roles. Which are ingrained into us from birth because of instincts we have retained from our evolutionary history that we may no longer require."Thoughts?(edit:) Additional though. Girls get mad that females are unrealistic sex objects. What does that make every male protagonist of basically every game? Most of them are poorly developed idiots who look like Arnold Schwarzenegger (that sad moment when his name is in spell-check) and Chuck Norris had a child with George Clooney's face. So we have Video Game Devs essentially making the people that bullied them in high school, dumb jocks and dumb cheerleaders.(2nd edit:) Wow this has got a lot of conversation for this subreddit only having 1118 subscribers. Love hearing peoples inputs on the matter.

38efx6	-59083	1433354086	Rochester	Living in the 19th Ward	I'm starting grad school at U of r in the fall and as such, I'm looking for apts. in the area. As a result of this, and a small budget, I started looking in the 19th Ward. I found a relatively nice apt on Millbank St.  I scheduled with the landlord to take a look at it. But my parents and sister (who have all grown up in the Rochester area, and my dad lived in Corn Hill years ago) are trying to convince me to not even consider it and stick solely to the Park Ave, South Wedge, White Coat Ghetto areas. Does anyone have any input on this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I would suggest Riot to make something like, when we ping "retreat" on enemy, he gets bigger or his outer red circle gets bigger. Something like that.

2qxuzy	-59116	1420051090	MechanicalKeyboards	Questions about HHKB vs. Realforce	I am preparing to buy my first Topre board and I would love any input from anyone who can compare the HHKB Pro 2 with the Realforce 87u 55g. Right now these are the two boards that I cannot decide between, I’m sure that I can get used to the unconventional layout of the HHKB but what I’m more worried about is the weighting of the keys.I would be using the board for frequent typing but also daily gaming and I’m worried that the 55g switches on the Realforce would be fatiguing, there are just so many conflicting views online. Right now I use MX browns and have never thought that they seemed too heavy at all. I would prefer the Realforce because of the layout and I actually think it looks better but if 55g switches are too heavy for gaming I will go for the HHKBI would really like to hear from someone who uses 55g topre switches for gaming. Thanks!ps I know that the Realforce comes in an all 45g version but elitekeyboards only has it in black and I just don’t like the way that it looks.

2ubcxy	-59116	1422721874	buildapc	[Troubleshooting] Please help I can't even play Youtube videos at a good fps with an R9 290!	OK, so this has been a problem that been going on pretty much since I built my pc. When I start my pc for the first time every day, it takes an extremely long time to boot (5 minutes with an M500 SSD), when I do finally get to desktop, my performance in games is terrible (I have an R9 290 and get around 10-20 fps in any game no matter how demanding it is). What I’ve also noticed is that the low fps isn’t limited to games, when I play Youtube videos after a slow boot I get super low fps with them too. I can see that the mouse curser doesn’t experience fps problems if that means anything. So I’ve got all this going on but when I restart my computer it boots up at a normal speed and plays games just like it should. So far what I’ve done is reinstall drivers and I reinstalled Windows to no avail. It’s been hard for me to test stuff out because it means that I have to leave my pc off for a couple hours to replicate the cold, slow boot. I did try removing the GPU to see if it would help but I continued to get slow boots. Right now I’m pretty sure that it is the motherboard and I’m close to getting a new one, which I could return if it turned out not to solve my problems. I’m wondering if you guys have any other suggestions about troubleshooting that I could do before spending money on hardware.**TLDR;** When I’m turning on my pc for the first time every day, it boots very slowly and gives me terrible fps in not just video games but youtube videos and the like. When I restart everything works fine. I think it’s the motherboard but if there’s anything I can do to figure this out without spending money then I’m all for it.Relevant specs:I5 4690k (not overclocked)Sapphire Tri-X R9 290 (only with factory overclock)Crucial M100 SSDGigabyte GA-Z97X-Gaming 5

I did my best but if you can see anyway to lower the price further or get more power with the same amount of money then that would be awesome. The main thing I was unsure of was the CPU. I told my friend that he has 3 options: i3 4160, i5 4660, or g3258 if he wants to overclock (which I don't think he does) are these good choices, or is one obviously the best?The build will be for gaming (everything from BF4 to emulators) at 1080p, it must be under $750 with OS, and peripherals are already taken care of.

Both are in great condition as they have received almost no use since I got my Realforce 87u. The Filco is perfect and the caps have maybe the slightest bit of shine on WASD and the spacebar (like really unnoticeable). NOTICE: The GMK caps are the ones listed [here](http://zealpc.net/collections/keycap-sets/products/dolch) on ZealPC's website and include the base set (including numpad) and the add-on kit. HOWEVER, it will NOT come with the blank 1x R1 keys (for people with standard ANSI layout, this will not effect comapatiblity).I will sell them together for $200 or separately  $100 for the Filco and $120 for the caps. I will only ship in the US and shipping prices will be added to the total.[TIMESTAMPS](http://imgur.com/HyQCtTF,ff53EST,2ETwtTZ,qKzATFa#0)If you have any questions let me know. Thanks!EDIT: EVERYTHING HAS SOLD
xlauv	-59119	1343950397	mylittlepony	Weekly gaming meetups/Tournaments	So by now the brony community has obviously grown fairly large so it seems like a good time for something like this. Why not have weekly gaming meetups for everyone? Every week or possibly every other week we could have large meetups in different video games such as league of legends and various steam games.Different members of the community could come out and have a chance to play with theirs fan as well. I'm sure bronies would like to talk to/play a round with their favorite artist and/or singer. While we've had stuff like this in the past having a fixed time for it every week or so would allow more people to take a part of it due to increased awareness as well as having a regular time to do it. Furthermore, we could have tournies within the community just for us. I'm sure there are plenty of bronies who have a competitive streak and play starcraft or league of legends. Those interested could form their own teams and compete for prizes. We could have commissions offered for some prizes as well as donations for Riot Point cards etc (in game league of legends currency). In the past, Riot has been very supportive of upstart tournaments like this, so we could possibly get in touch with them and Valve as well.Thoughts, etc?

So let's hear everyone's favorite thing about the fandom, whether it be the people you've met or just the show itself. I'll start, I absolutely love reading so I obviously have fallen in love with fanfiction, hence my name. (Cookie to the person who gets the reference).

2pcb79	-59119	1418629946	halo	[Suggestion] Rant thread	So having seen literally the same thing happen with Destiny, the complaining gets really really old really fast. We get it, the game still doesn't work for a lot off people. We get it, the game still doesn't work a lot. Do we really need 150 different variations of the same thread every day? Can we just make a rant thread for people to complain about their MCC not working, and a stickied thread when a new patch drops so people can talk about results? This would keep everything nice and together and hopefully we'd see less spam of the same shit over and over again. I really just want the sub back...

2qvzl0	-59119	1419999818	personalfinance	Advice on receiving money from life insurance	Posting on my phone, so I'm sorry if there are any typos.Basically, my grandfather passed away last March and we are wondering how to receive the payment. We have three options the company provides, five year deferall which we probably won't do, lump sum, and income payments. My mother is 51 and possibly looking to move soon to a bigger city to be closer to family. The insurance company is Hartford insurance. Is there anything we should know about these? What exactly do each of these mean? I don't honestly know what else is important, so if there's any other information needed just ask and I'll see if I can get it. 
2zjp6d	-59119	1426734651	mylittlepony	Does anyone else get discouraged?	I don't really know how to say this, I haven't ever really been good about writing, but does anyone else kinda just get discouraged? I mean, there's a lot of hate for bronies. A lot. That's pretty obvious and is fairly easy to overlook. What bothers me is when there's a bunch of formerly big name musicians (won't name names, just in case, but it's pretty easy to find among twitter etc) etc talking now about how they've had what this community has become and the like. Now, I've been here since near the beginning, and honestly it really saddens me to see this. But, at the same time, I don't see why they think that. Can anyone help explain where this comes from? I understand theres been some drama with Steven Universe lately, but I don't really know much about that. Does anyone else get discouraged like me?

I cannot remember my exact specs since I'm not currently at my house, but basically what I have at the moment is: GPU: GTS 450 2GBCPU: AMD Phenom II16GB RAM650 Watt power supply (I believe, can't recall on the exact name)Basically, I need some advice on what GPU, motherboard, and CPU to get. I'd really enjoy a great PC for gaming and playing modded Skyrim maxed out @ 1080p. Some other uses for this PC will be for occasionally rendering in Cinema 4D and After Effrcts.My budget for the GPU is 700 dollars. For the CPU and motherboard, my budget is 500 dollars.I'm thinking about getting an i5 4930, with a GTX 670 or 760. No idea on what motherboard to purchase though. Is an i7 really worth the extra money for editing/rendering purposes? Anyway, any suggestions are fully appreciated.

Other cool bug stories welcome as they're always fun.TL;DR: Stuck on GG engineering in brawlpub, went away to wait out queue, came back to find I had already won.

3840ff	-59183	1433182622	Drugs	need advice for dealing with ex-heroin junkie dad.	hey /r/drugs, I post this because I've recently gotten in contact with my dad after a very long time. (10 years)he is a former heroin user and because contact is done over Facebook and phone, I cant outright verify that he still does use or not.despite his absence in my life I do still love him, although it does verge on pity in some aspects.after only a short 2 days of contact where I've said this is his last chance that i will consider him as a father.i think there's genuine effort on his behalf to stay in contact, although from what i can see i truly don't know if he is clean or is at danger of relapsing.and even if he is still clean he still hasn't really integrated himself back out of the bubble he put himself in.so all I ask is there anything I can do as one of the few people left who is willing to give him a chance to help him? I do think that my interaction with him may be a catalyst with him, I fear could either push him to using again by just saying the wrong thing.so basically my question is how do I deal with him? or if you have any stories of similar from your personal experience that may help.thank you.TL;DR: Dad is a former heroin addict, i need some advice on how to help even if all i can do is minor

I hardly hear anyone complain, in the media or otherwise, about his tendency to jack up three's while he shoots below average.

xtik1	-59184	1344341368	unt	Donate Some Books to Africa Plz	Dear Mean Green Eagles, The site Course Hero has started a knowledge Drive here at UNT. What that basically means is that the student resource site, Course Hero, has a site where you basically upload documents to the site (Study Guides, Note Sets, Practice Quizzes, Practice Exams, Problem Sets, Labs, Reports, Research Papers, Essays) in order to create a giant database of info for classes to help out your fellow students. You get free access to the site for uploading, and every ten documents they donate a book to Africa (my favorite part). I'm an intern for the site so my job is the spread the word about it, help people get on the site, and basically get as many books to Africa as I possibly can. I ask you, fellow Eagles, to help me do this. I promise this is not a scam, some sort of ruse, or anything other than a regular UNT student and fellow redditor asking for some help. If you have any questions, comments, need help, or just want to tell me I suck and should shut up, feel free to email me at captainfalconlink@hotmail.com. And yes that is an email I made in 6th grade after playing Super Smash Bros.

Just my opinion, but I think the organization that most resembles the Spurs would be the Dallas Mavericks in terms of Coach, team system, and ability to get the most out of role players that otherwise would flounder on other teams. I think this is most evidenced by Dallas' championship run using people like Peja, Stevenson, and Barea. Now they're getting an all-star season from OJ Mayo who's never done this well before. Thoughts?

I had him last year and went to many of his office hours. We discussed his research, graduate school, etc. He was one of the first people to suggest graduate school to me. My dad even came to his class as a guest speaker (my dad served on a UN mission and the class was international conflict). I emailed him a month ago asking if he'd feel comfortable writing me an LOR and he still hasn't sent me anything back. The deadline isn't extremely soon but I'd like to be one of the first applicants. I was wondering if anybody had any similar experiences or any advice on what the next course of action should be; should I email him again, go to his office hours this spring, etc.TL;DR: Need my last LOR and professor didn't respond to my request.
1u8gpr	-59184	1388677925	gradadmissions	Can anyone take a look at my SoP for a political theory masters program?	Ok so this is the rought draft:When I was seven years old I lived on an island with my family. It was sunny, it was beautiful, and the weather was warm. I liked living there. One day, without much warning, my father told me that we had to leave and he had to stay. I was upset. He told me it was because of "the dirty fucking communists and that piece of shit Castro." That was essentially my introduction to political theory. I switched to international studies when I was twenty and had just enrolled in Army ROTC, attempting to follow in the footsteps my father, grandfather, his father, and so on. Later I was offered a contract guaranteeing that my studies would be paid for and I would be employed for the next eight years. I declined because, on accident almost, my studies had become my obsession. I found myself wanting to understand the nature of political institutions and their theoretical base at an obsessional level. I want to study political theory because I truly believe, despite centuries of research on the topic, there is still so much to be learned from the past and more to be created in the future. I want to study political theory at BLANK because of the faculty. There is an amazing array of political science faculty and as a particular and small example, my reading of Dr. PERSON'S writings on Hegel have absolutely solidified my desire to study at BLANK. The area of study on which I would like to focus is the political theory and critical analysis of the current and potential future security apperatus, military structure, and automated weapons technology. I won't deny that this mostly comes from my upbringing. My entire immediate family has served and I am the first son in several generations to not enlist in the armed forces. My father served as a private military contractor for Dyncore in Iraq. I am interested in the critical analysis of the structure of PMC's concerning their current and potential future roles. A possible thesis might be a critical analysis of government's information gathering systems through the lense of Michel Foucault's theory of power relations.

My dad is a police officer and he mentioned the other day how he is part of a policemen's association, which to my understanding basically functioned as a union. I was wondering how, historically, these have survived while most unions have been dismantled over time for private sector workers.edit: to be specific, in the United States, why have public sector unions not faced the same sort of elimination that private sector one's have? Have they grown, stayed the same? What is the history like comparing the two?

Penny Arcade explains MOBAs	http://www.penny-arcade.com/ - Today's blog"People sometimes wonder what makes (ahem) “MOBA” games such pheromonal attractants for beast-men, writhers, tarantulons, and other varieties of online super-fiend, but I don’t.  League of Legends is often considered some variant of “easy mode” compared to DOTA or HoN, but any one of those games “matters” more second by second than a game of Call of Duty.  This isn’t about fun, I’m not talking about amusement or craft or anything really aside from the stakes.  You don’t just die and lose a “point.”  Death is an “event” in a constantly shifting constellation of data, and its effects are profound.  Lone Wolves can be disruptive, but at ground level this is a team game.  You can lose quickly, very early on, and then you’ve wasted everyone’s time.  So, yes.  They’re angry and they don’t mind telling you; you stole their time.  You literally made their life shorter."EDIT: P.S.   Gabe from Penny Arcade doing an AMA tomorrow! (Jan 30th) 1:30pm PST

I'll list a few rough ideas I have and maybe someone can help me refine them.**Sponsor-a-noob Gladiator Fights***  Each wealthy player who wishes to participate "sponsors" a noob, which is to say that they will be competing on their behalf to win whatever the prize is.*  The new players can compete also (unless maybe we fight using GG geared chars or something, may be fun), but this just makes it so that the old "rich get richer" cliche doesn't come to fruition.*  Start new characters and fight to the death at level 9? level 18? No twinked gear only what you find while walking.*  Maybe even have each participant decide which class one of the ENEMY participants is going to use? My thoughts on this are to avoid any possible LLD "trump spec" that I don't know about, I'm very naive to dueling honestly.IDK BOYS WHAT DO YOU THINK? I also kinda had an idea of some kind of raffle system but I rather like the thought of dueling on fresh-walked chars :D

34n4b0	-59186	1430589151	Surface	Onedrive screwed?	My SP3 (i5/256Gb) booted with near blank window and message "...\systemprofile\Desktop is unavailable...". I booted a few times and got the same thing. Searched online and found the hard reset trick (VolumeUp/Power for 15 secs, wait 15 secs) which got me back to 'normal'. Only my Onedrive folder had been renamed to Onedrive.old; I also had Onedrive(2).old and (3) and (4); and computer busily downloading another Onedrive folder from the cloud.Weird thing is the .old folder still seems linked to Onedrive as checking properties has the file size clicking up beyond actual size on disk, counting all the offline stored files.I had these .old folders once before and waited to download everything again then deleted them (after doing a backup). Nothing bad happened but still p*ssed about it.Can anyone suggest why the glitch in the first place, shortcuts that will avoid the long download or any way of stopping it happening again?TIA.

3fj19y	-59186	1438538271	Surface	Anything like Day One?	Only a couple of things I miss from the iPad and one of them is the diary/journal app, [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/). Has anyone found anything equivalent? Tried [My Own Diary HD](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/apps/my-own-diary-hd/9wzdncrdfnrk) but it was just too weak on the actual diary entry side. Any other suggestions?

uah7n	-59192	1338307275	AskReddit	What are the basics I need to know about the history of the world till the end of the 20th century?	The only history we needed to learn was back in middle school and it was limited to the regional history around here.In high school, we needed to choose between Geography,History or Advanced Mathematics and I opted for the third. So I ended up fairly ignorant about history of the rest of the world.So I have about a month ahead of me when I'll be at home and think it might be best to teach myself some history.Got any pointers where it might be good to start? What are the important historical events I need to know about? Events that changed the course of the world perhaps? Looking forward to know how the story of humanity unfolded basically to have us end up at the present.

vbjab	-59192	1340179612	AndroidQuestions	Can anyone suggest one Android app for browsing Reddit that offers a good alternative to the desktop browsing experience?	I've never been on Reddit on my phone (Nexus S - stock ICS 4.0.4). But in 10 days, I am moving to a different state so won't be having an internet connection accessible from my laptop for a while. Until things get sorted out, I am looking for an app that can stand as an alternative. I've seen Android users say that no Android app can truly suffice for the computer browsing experience (which is well...expected) but iOS has quite a good Reddit app to offer. So is there any Android app according to people who actually use it on a regular basis that is good enough to rely on for redditing on Android devices?

1h1xgn	-59192	1372185042	AskReddit	How do I get rid of the stray dogs that have taken over the yard?	I am at my parents on a visit and they seem to be fighting a losing war with stray dogs who have taken over the grounds. Partly it's their own fault because they started regularly feeding two strays who took up home at the foot of the stairs. But over the months, they brought their friends over and now the situation is getting quite out of control.At first the strays started scaring off and attacking anyone who tried to enter into the grounds. While my family found it funny and brushed the matter aside, now they have even started barking and chasing at anyone who they hear entering through the gates. One of the males even attempted to bite at my leg the other day when I was standing nearby when they broke into a fight.We tried to chase them off but to no avail. They keep returning and growl back at you if you try to "shoo" them off. Well, some look into the matter (yeah, I googled!) I found suggestions that dogs hate vinegar. Well ok, I sprayed some on two of them yesterday and it didn't change shit. Rubbing alcohol? Tried...doesn't fucking work. You say hosing them off keeps dogs away? I flushed a full bucket  of water on them earlier and they were back after shaking and drying off.In fact, we even tried chasing them off with sticks. Now they just hate me more than the other family members. I have stopped feeding them regularly, but my mom keeps sneaking a treat or two for the 8-9 dogs because she hates seeing them go hungry.Oh did I mention it's goddamned weird when dogs are fucking all over the yard when you are trying to have a normal conversation with a family member? Well...there you go.So, is there any way I could possibly get rid of the dogs that have taken over the yard at my family home involving the least bit of cruelty?tl;dr  **Stray dogs have taken over the grounds. Wat do?**

Indian artisan goods are quickly being wiped out by cheaper factory-made goods, but I think these artisan traditions are precious and should be preserved. So I'm starting a project to help increase worldwide exposure to Indian artisan goods.This fall, I will take 3-month excursion through India in search of some of the highest-quality handmade and traditionally-made goods in the country. These include fine silks, pottery, jewelry, tapestries, among others in a wide array of Indian handicrafts. Afterwards, I will work with retail and distribution professionals in Phoenix, Arizona and a computer programmer in Uttar Pradesh, India to create a fair trade online marketplace, making these precious goods available to the world.What do you think? Is this a worthy project? Please [check it out](http://www.indiegogo.com/Save-the-Indian-Artisans?a=208904&amp;i=addr) and let me know what you think. Thank you very much.

zl4vs	-59205	1347161086	investing	Questioning the Wisdom of 401(k)s and Roth IRAs (specifically for young investors)	When I was in college, a financial advisor demonstrated to me how if I created a Roth IRA and made the maximum contribution of $4000 per year, assuming a 12% annual return, I would be a millionaire by the time I retired.However, although I agree that people should build wealth and save for retirement, I question the conventional wisdom that we should do so through 401(k)s and Roth IRAs, especially for investors who are young (say, in their 20s).There are some very important risks involved with locking away a large amount of your wealth in these accounts. For example:* The US government is debasing our currency and there are doubts about the future solvency of America.* Rules and tax rates pertaining to these accounts may change in the next 30-40 years between now and when you retire. The US government is not above changing the rules of the game.* The funds are not liquid, and therefore are trapped in the US until you retire. You cannot move to another country and make use of the funds. You cannot reinvest the funds in your own business.* The funds have limited use. You cannot hedge or protect your retirement account by using puts or shorting stocks. These are just a few ideas I have. Is my cynicism warranted? I'd love to hear your feedback.

I've included the pastebin code link, as well as a link to the screenshot of the problem I'm having, and I'll do my best to explain what I've done and what I'm trying to accomplish (I still consider myself a bit of a php n00b so bear with me).Link to pastebin for code: http://pastebin.com/nmuJnkQ3Link to image of issue: http://i.imgur.com/bQEnu.pngMy first function if_get_defaults is where I'm establishing my option defaults.My next function if_options_init (which was referenced from the following guide: http://www.chipbennett.net/2011/02/17/incorporating-the-settings-api-in-wordpress-themes/), from my understanding checks to see if the defaults are written to the database, and if they are not, does so (so essentially setting my default values).I then initialize my theme options, register my settings, and add my options page to the admin menu.I am using tabs so then I have my function which establishes the tabs.Now I actually get to where I establish my options pages themselves, beginning with my general settings. I establish a variable $settings which I use for my convenience when echoing the values into the input fields, and then the settings_fields and do_settings_sections so I can actually save and reset my settings.I then lay out each of my settings options, telling it to write the values to their assigned names, and I follow it all off with:&lt;p class="submit"&gt;&lt;input name="theme_if_options" type="submit" class="button-primary" value="&lt;?php esc_attr_e('Save Defaults', 'theme_if_options'); ?&gt;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;input name="theme_if_options" type="submit" class="button-secondary" value="&lt;?php esc_attr_e('Reset Defaults', 'theme_if_options'); ?&gt;" /&gt;I finally have my validate function to strip any HTML from a couple of my values and to avoid parse errors with my check box.So, with that all said and done, I am getting a 0 filled into all of my input fields, and I am unable to save any settings. I'm sure there's just one or two minor things I am overlooking, as I feel like I am on the right track here. Again below you can find the options page in its entirety and a link to what I am seeing in my backend. I know this was a bit lengthy, but any help you could provide to get me on the right track would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.Update:Just thought I'd share something that I discovered which will hopefully help in narrowing this down.I was seeing what would cause the 0s to be outputted in my fields and realized that the last part of my if_options_validate function makes the value of my show facebook like box option 0 if unchecked. I temporarily removed that entire function and took it out of the register settings string and now when Save is pressed, the input fields display S, and when Reset is pressed the fields display R. I changed "Save Defaults" to "Jave Defaults" in the value of the save button just to confirm and doing this changes the output to J instead of S, so it's just taking on the first letter.So now it seems that my main function theme_if_options is not operating the way that it should, and is instead taking on the value of the last thing using it. I'm not sure why it's doing this, but this appears to be the issue so hopefully that will help those that have more experience with this help me narrow it down. Thank you.
h5gbt	-59220	1304665886	Wordpress	Trouble with update_option() in theme settings import function	Hey everyone, I'm having a bit of trouble with an import/export option I'm building into my theme. Hopefully I explain this well, let me start with the function.function ifeature_import_options() {	$options = get_option('ifeature');	$import = $options['if_import_code'];	if ($import != '');		$options_array = (unserialize($import));			foreach( $options_array as $option_name =&gt; $option_value ) {			update_option( $option_name, $option_value );			}}if_import_code returns the serialized output of $options (which the user enters into a textarea in my options panel which is taken from another textarea that contains the serialized output of the current theme options), and I've tested that $options_array is properly unserializing the import code as it prints the following:Array ( [if_menu_color] =&gt; Pink [if_font] =&gt; Arial [if_css_options] =&gt; [if_favicon] =&gt; [if_ga_code] =&gt; [if_import_code] =&gt; [if_export_code] =&gt; b:0; [if_logo] =&gt; [if_menuicon] =&gt; [if_header_contact] =&gt; [if_facebook] =&gt; [if_twitter] =&gt; [if_linkedin] =&gt; [if_youtube] =&gt; [if_googlemaps] =&gt; [if_email] =&gt; [if_rsslink] =&gt; [if_home_description] =&gt; [if_home_keywords] =&gt; [if_home_title] =&gt; [if_callout_title] =&gt; [if_callout_text] =&gt; [if_callout_img] =&gt; [if_callout_image_link] =&gt; [if_slider_type] =&gt; posts [if_slider_placement] =&gt; feature [if_slider_category] =&gt; [if_slider_posts_number] =&gt; [if_slider_height] =&gt; [if_slider_delay] =&gt; [if_slider_animation] =&gt; random [if_footer_text] =&gt; [if_hide_callout] =&gt; 0 [if_show_fb_like] =&gt; 0 [if_hide_slider] =&gt; 0 [if_hide_boxes] =&gt; 0 [if_hide_link] =&gt; 0 [if_slider_navigation] =&gt; 0 )So I have the new array that needs to be written to my options, but the update_option code I've used isn't working.

h8p3w	-59220	1305088908	Wordpress	Looking for a WordPress e-commerce/ subscription management solution similar to what Elegant Themes uses	Hey everyone. We're looking for a better e-commerce solution for selling our WordPress themes. Right now we're using the HQ-Tips &amp; Tricks eStore plugin, which is great for the secure digital downloads, however we're experiencing a lot of limitations.We're eventually going to be moving towards a subscription model, but we will also be selling themes a la carte. Our biggest issue right now is having a good system for our customers to be able to have access to the latest version. We're looking for a system very similar to what Elegant Themes uses, where the customer can login and download the latest version of their purchased products. A must have is to be able to hide the download link, we don't want the source of the files getting out obviously.  A bonus feature would be something that integrates with a forum. Right now I'm manually giving customers access to our forum for paid customers (using simplepress), and as time goes on this is going to become quite tedious to manage. Does anyone have any recommendations for something along these lines? Thank you. 
hawtg	-59220	1305328628	Wordpress	Need help with wp_handle_upload function for my theme options page	Hello everyone, back for more help from you fine folks.I'm giving my theme options page a bit of a facelift and replacing my text input fields for links to images with actual image uploaders. I seem to be having a bit of trouble with wp_handle_upload portion, so I'll outline how I'm doing everything below. For the actual upload file portion I'm using the following:&lt;input type="file" name="&lt;?php echo 'ifeature['.$value['id'].']'; ?&gt;" id="&lt;?php echo 'if['.$value['id'].']'; ?&gt;" size="40" /&gt;    I'm obviously not going to paste my entire theme options code, but the above is placed within a &lt;form method="post" action="options.php" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt; and the uploader does let me browse and select a file, so that part is working as it should.Also, without explaining the entire structure of my backend, the variable I am trying to save the file to is if_logo.Now, here is what I am trying to use to actually upload the file to wp-upload after the user uploads the file and saves the theme options:        $options = get_option('ifeature');	$logo = $options['if_logo'];        $newinput = array();       if ($_FILES[$logo]) {        $overrides = array('test_form' =&gt; false);         $file = wp_handle_upload($_FILES[$logo], $overrides);        $newinput['file'] = $file;    }    return $newinput;However, upon saving I am getting an undefined index error for logo, so the file isn't being saved to if_logo. This is my first time attempting something like this so I'm sure I'm missing something. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I'm calling post titles and content from a custom post type within a div I've called #customcaption, and the actual text is called within a div called .captiontext within the previous div.Everything displays as it should, but I can't quite get the fade in and out to work the way it does when you call the caption from the HTML title attribute. I've used the following beforeChange and afterChange functions to try and achieve this, but it's not quite working:beforeChange: function(){    $('.captiontext').fadeOut(500);}, afterChange: function(){    $('.captiontext').fadeIn(500);}, I would also like it to match the animation speed like it does by default when calling the caption from the HTML title. I'm very new to Nivo Slider so I'm a bit of a n00b, any help would be greatly appreciated.

ns0jx	-59220	1324967495	Anxiety	Need some self-help advice.	First time posting in this subreddit, and hopefully this is the right place for this thread. I'm looking for some advice on some good self-help resources for coping with stress/anxiety. I'll give a bit of background on me and try to keep it as short as possible.My whole life I've always been a bit of a worrier, whether it be about school, work, personal relationships, etc. I've lived in a somewhat constant fear of disappointing people, and it tends to make me put other peoples thoughts and feelings before mine. I allow myself to get way too stressed out about things that are probably not very important in the long run, and I also have a hard time expressing my feelings to the people that are close to me. I've been debating seeing a psychologist to try and tackle some of these issues, but I'm also looking for some thoughts/advice on things I can start doing now to try and stop some of this behavior. Any kind of books/articles/anything really would be beneficial. I'm already starting to work out again, which used to help when I was younger. I'm also going to attempt to practice yoga/meditation as a stress reliever. I'm also going to try and work on taking more "me" time. I work from home and run my own business so I always struggle with separating work with personal life, so that's another one of my big goals. Anyway, thanks for reading and I'm open to any feedback.

u5euc	-59220	1337997017	webhosting	Changing IP on cPanel account from Shared to Dedicated	Hey everyone.I apologize if this seems pretty basic but I just want to make sure I have all my ducks in a row before I actually pull the trigger. I have a server through Rackspace that I'm running WHM on with a couple accounts including my company's primary domain.In order to register an SSL cert to the cpanel account that has our primary domain we needed to get a dedicated IP. I got that from Rackspace and I have confirmed that it's pointing to our server. My question is: do I have to do anything else other than use the change account IP utility in WHM? Do I need to manually edit the DNS zones or will that happen automatically? I've been doing some reading trying to understand this all more and I read that lowering the TTL time would help it propagate faster. Right now it's set on 24 hours but there are several entries and I'm not sure which one I should change (or if I should bother at all).I searched for a sort of step by step guide on how to do this but I really couldn't find anything. I just don't want to go and switch the IP and then bork our site.Any information would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

2jq5vj	-59222	1413754946	youshouldwrite	I wrote: an angelic psychotic man paints walls	The never ending wall stood before him.  Stark white, spanning the horizon.  This wall is his canvas. "What shall we paint today?" he ponders quietly to himself.  As usual, the images begin to fill his mind, colors and designs, stories to be told.  The paint begins to fly from his brush, stroke after stroke of angst and anger, joy and despair.  He knows this day will never end for he is eternal and his paintbrush is his instrument of creation. As he works, a crowd begins to gather, watching him in his glorious endeavor.  They gasp in awe and the wonders he is capable of. This fuels him.  On and on he goes.From the crowd standing around the sidewalk, a child looks to her mother and asks, "Mom, what is that man doing?  Is he dancing?""I don't know Sally.  It looks as if he's painting.""But he has no paint.""Maybe he doesn't need any. Maybe he doesn't need any."

2zyv2s	-59242	1427076080	kpophelp	Hey Everybody, I would love some advice on purchasing concert DVDs and BlueRays from Korean and Japanese sites	                            I assume many of you have experience purchasing merch from Korean and Japanese sites. I just saw the teasers for the DVD/BlueRay of the BIGBANG Japan Dome Tour "X" and was blown away by the live arrangements of the songs. Even though I much prefer the Korean versions to the Japanese ones, I can't get over those concert arrangements.I followed the links in the description of the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BncMOm-7ZU) and was unable to make much headway from there. The pages even seemed expertly slow to load (my internet connection is fine) and the google site translations were unhelpful. any advice on how to proceed would be appreciated. Thanks all!

fyqdn	-59250	1299465167	AskReddit	At what point does a friend with benefits (fwb) cross over into the significant other spot (story inside)	So my roommate and best friend has been seeing this girl lately, which he terms his 'fuck buddy' and 'slampiece'.  Anyway, he explains that they have discussed their intentions and neither of them wants to date but I posed the question the other night while we were out with the guys:"At what point do you say, hmmm I'm passing up on going out and meeting OTHER women to stay home with my 'fuck buddy'?"Basically, they will spend random nights together and rarely spend time together during the day unless its a weekend and they happened to get up late after an all night bang fest.  But when this happens, he'll typically cook her breakfast or they'll go out to brunch/drink.  The pretense of their relationship used to be that she was HAMMERED every time she came over (which used to annoy the shit out of me because she is a flat out bitch when she's drunk), but recently, she'll come over with a bottle of wine or something and they'll drink together.To me, it sounds like they're dating but ignoring the fact.  I don't really care, except he chastised me for dating a girl long distance because we couldn't hang out and go meet girls... but to me he's the one who has crossed over to the dark side (especially since my long distance relationship has no effect whatsoever on us getting hammered and playing video games all night or going downtown, etc.)So, Reddit, what are YOUR thoughts on the subject?

I see all of the wonderful hospitality they're putting out, but are they trying to be the SEC's new favorite little brother by making everyone feel like they're SOOO HAPPY TO BE HERE?!I guess I am just really confused since it took South Carolina nearly 20 years to become somewhat relevant in the SEC, but I don't remember us deep throating the rest of the conference to get here. We took a lot of shit from a lot of fans, and still continue to do so because we have only had one truly GOOD season in our 20 years, but seriously, WHAT THE FUCK MIZZOU.I get that the shit talking had to stop after getting beat by GA, but come on...it isn't necessary to be this cordial...it is football after all.Am I the only person that feels this way?  People outside of the conference feel to weigh in, it may just be my homerism taking its toll on this whole thing, but I'm frustrated. Not hateful. Just frustrated and confused.

I was watching highlights from his freshman season onward, and I know I'm a homer, but no other player has had a greater effect on a team's success like Lattimore did with South Carolina in my lifetime. I witnessed my gamecocks go from mediocre to what ESPN considers an 'elite' SEC team in just a few seasons. The guy motivated players, fans, and everyone around him to be great. I know Spurrier has a something to do with it, but I'll be damned if we don't give that kid some credit. He was the best thing to happen to South Carolina in a long damn time.What other players have done this for other teams? I'd love to hear other fans' stories and why.EDIT: Grammar

I can join quick matches with no problem, but when I want to play with my friends we run into these same issues every time:1.  The server browser is faulty. It either shows me all full games, or all games with no players (tried every filter setting for players).2. This feature may have been removed, but I can't figure out how to party up with friends outside of a game.3. When I try to join friends, it seems like every server is prioritized to fill 24/24 constantly, and I can never join - I always get the same message (There are no fee commander slots).The one time I was able to join a friend in game, I had to sit there spamming join over and over until near the end of the match when I FINALLY beat someone into the game.I realize these may be launch issues, but I play battlefield solely with my friends for the teamwork, and I am having the most difficult time joining them in game or partying up in general. This wouldn't be that much of an issue if I could use the server browser to find games that were half full, but I can't.  Is anyone else experiencing this frustration?Great game, otherwise, just can't wait to play with my friends!

I've found through trial and error that three blade razors in particular have a longer life than razors jam packed with more blades.  With that said, they do have a greater potential to cause razor burn and you have to be a little bit more careful to not cut yourself, but you'll save a bunch of money as they last between 2-3x longer than others. Not to mention, they're usually cheaper.**Second:** When your blades start to go dull, find a pair of jeans and run the razor *with the blades*, like in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Kxiom83Js).**Third:** Keep your razor immersed in mineral or baby oil when not in use. (*Credit: sivetic*) **Edit:** Or alternatively, you can dry them after each use. (*Credit: qbase6*)With these tips, I've managed to extend the life of my razors sometimes to greater than a few months.  Hope this helps others. If you have any other tips, feel free to comment and I'll add them to the list!Thanks for reading!

I have been through the local shelters and seen lots of wonderful dogs, but none that have really fit the type of pup I'm looking for - mostly due to my availability, type of dog (size, breed), timeline for adoption, and available funding. (Trust me, there have been plenty I'd gladly bring home :), just haven't been able to commit yet)Ideally, I'm looking for a younger dog so that I can develop an early bond with them.  I am limited on funding, but want to find a new pal for a forever home.As a disclaimer, I continue to visit pet helpers, ASPCA, etc. but only recently have I been able to really consider bringing a pal home.

x7gc9	-59261	1343332170	Atlanta	Best utility companies in Atlanta?	Hey guys, moving back downtown soon with some friends and I'm the guy setting up our utility accounts. Last place I lived, one of my other room mates handled it and I didn't really ask questions outside of what I owed him every month. I know for water I have to bring a notarized lease, ID, and application in in person, and Power I can do online, but as far as a natural gas company, I'm pretty lost. There seems to be a ton to choose from, but I can only find negative ratings online. Anyone here mind sharing which  companies they find to be the most helpful / best priced?If the actual neighborhood matters, I'll be about a half mile south of Little 5, just beyond the Edgewood Retail Complex.
10r0rf	-59261	1349072582	Atlanta	MARTA smartphone Apps?	As the post said, I'm wondering if anyone knows of a decent app that would give information for MARTA, such as train times. Just got my first smart phone, so I figured why not? Also, I seem to have the best luck, because I regularly walk onto the platform AS my train leaves.So yea, if anyone knows of one, thanks for the info. If not, hey, I tried.

It doesn't appear to be on my internet's end, as none of my room mates are having problems. Just thought I'd check, though.

1b3isq	-59261	1364365663	Cooking	Advice on cooking ground goat meat?	Direct copy/post from a thread I mistakenly opened in /r/askculinary instead of /r/Cooking.As the title says, I'm looking on some general tips for cooking ground goat meat. I've eaten it before but never cooked it. Mostly just wondering general things like texture, cooking temperature, how well done it should be cooked, etc.I thought about searching through google, but felt like reddit could be a slightly more directed effort. Any advice or knowledge is appreciated.Also, if it matters, we'll be cooking for roughly 15 people, so the general idea would be make something simpler, like burger patties.
1eti07	-59261	1369202396	Atlanta	Best bagels in town?	As the title suggest, I'm looking for a place to get decent bagels. Grocery stores only ever seem to carry Thomas bagels, specifically Cinnamon Raisin or Blueberry. I'm just wondering if anyone has a bakery in mind that makes decent, non sugary bagels. Figured I'd check the hivemind before googling / yelping.** EDIT**  There appear to be a few decent places you guys know about, but most of them are farther out in the suburbs. I'll have to try out a few different places in the next week or so, and remember the rest for when I get OTP, be it Kennesaw or Alpharetta. Thanks all!

1n5xy3	-59261	1380183463	Pathfinder_RPG	Help with Cavalier mechanics?	This might just be a simple search, but my knowledge of the Paizo forums is pretty non-existent. I've found a decent third party archetype for Cavalier I'm wanting to try, and the GM approves, but one thing I still don't fully understand are banners. From the srd:&gt;At 5th level, a cavalier’s banner becomes a symbol of inspiration to his allies and companions. As long as the cavalier’s banner is clearly visible, all allies within 60 feet receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made as part of a charge. At 10th level, and every five levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by +1. The banner must be at least Small or larger and must be carried or displayed by the cavalier or his mount to function.The archetype I'm using replaces the mount with an animal companion of sorts. But I still don't fully understand how I display my banner / would go about using it? I think there are a few magic items you can attach to spears / lances / polearms, but the theme of the character was more of an up close melee fighter. Any way around this, or is the banner just a lost feature?If anyone is curious, the archetype is listed [here.](http://paizo.com/threads/rzs2lqzy?Hound-Master#26) Think Ash Warriors, from Dragon Age. Melee combat, using a hound as a flanking buddy.
1ry509	-59261	1386026090	wow	Suggestions for leveling?	Just bought a new copy of the game, as I lost my account ~4 years ago. Currently have a level 21 shaman, and that's it. I'm starting to notice though, as I do the occasional dungeon, that leveling in this game is stupidly fast, even compared to when I last played, around ToC release in Wrath. Anyone have suggestions on not falling super far behind gearwise, when I don't have thousands of gold for this bloated economy or a 90 to funnel me heirlooms?If it matters, I'm horde on Bleeding Hollow.*Edit for clarity: I haven't only been queuing for dungeons, I do each dungeon once, then did maybe two dungeons at random for the grab bag. I was just alarmed at how quickly I leveled, even without heirlooms or the other XP buffs I've seen lately. I am glad to know it slows down again towards wrath, as I always remember Outlands being pretty fast in BC. Thanks for the suggestions though.

1wpcd2	-59261	1391227354	atlbeer	Hopslam tomorrow	Hey guys, I know a lot of people are still hunting around for some hopslam,  especially with the snow messing up deliveries. Unfortunately I don't have specifics, but my manager told me we were getting our order tomorrow afternoon. Store is Savi Provisions in buckhead, in the shopping plaza at Piedmont and Roswell. Our order last year sold for about $18.00 per pack so I imagine it'll be close to the same. Specific address is 3655 Roswell Road, zipcode is 30342.I get back into work at 4:00 PM tomorrow so I can update once I have specifics, or people can call in after about 2:30-3:00, and we should have specific info for you.
21kgc5	-59261	1395979470	wow	Need help choosing a new realm.	As the title says, I'm looking to roll on a new realm. Back in the heydays of WoW, I always played on PVP realms with friends, despite never being big on PVP. It was just what you've done. I resubscribed in November after a few years absence, and have enjoyed it, but have realized I want to find a decent PVE realm instead. I'm looking for advice / a sales pitch for your realm basically. Looking to try out alliance, just for something new, but either faction is game. Mostly looking for economy strength, active chat / sociable guilds, and the like. All else fails, I'll just keep hanging out on Bleeding Hollow and sighing dejectedly when I get camped.
220vvm	-59261	1396456596	Atlanta	Childish Gambino ticket up for grabs!	Hey guys, I've checked the FAQ and everything, didn't blatantly see rules against selling tickets on here. If it's against the rules though I'll gladly take the post down.Like I said in the title, I have one (1) ticket for Childish Gambino up for grabs. I bought it months ago when they first went up, without checking my class schedule. Turns out I have a huge test Saturday morning (yay accounting at GSU), and as such, cannot afford to go to the show. I'm not looking to make a profit, I just want to get get my money back basically. The ticket, after fees, cost me $50, so that's all I'm looking for. I can drop it off tomorrow at the venue, or we can meet up any time between today 6:00 PM - show time tomorrow (show starts at 6, gates will probably be around 4-5?)If anyone is interested, please just shoot me a PM. It's going to be on a first come, first served basis.

They plan on opening tomorrow (04/25) at 10:00 AM and closing at 5:00 AM the following day, as a sort of Grand Opening.

2fvv74	-59261	1410243716	Atlanta	Decent Gyms in town?	So, I'm no longer a student, and thus, do not have access to the campus gym. I'm looking for a decent gym in town, preferably month to month instead of long contract. Long hours are a plus as well because my work schedule changes weekly, but it's by no means necessary. I'm generally new to the whole idea of regular work outs and fitness, but you have to start somewhere, right?
2hra7y	-59261	1411961592	learndota2	Help with certain supports?	So, I'm relatively new, only been playing maybe a month. I'm not new to MOBAs having played LoL and smite in the past, so I'm pretty well adapted to mechanics. My biggest challenge is in adopting the meta of DOTA, which seems pretty distinct from the other MOBAs I;ve played.Certain characters I understand and have fallen in love with, such as Disruptor and Earthshaker. Others have thrown me through a loop though, such as Lina and Skywrath. I simply don't get why people in the pro scene, and thus the people in pubs, swear they should be supports. Their kits seem built more for damage than anything else, with Lina's passive and ult, or Skywrath's Q and W.TLDR: enjoying the game, but still struggling with favored role. Looking for basic tips and picks.*edit* It's been pointed out I didn't really ask any specific questions. I guess I didn't. Can't edit the title, but I guess what I'd like to know is how to play supportive roles better in Dota. I've read the Purge guide linked in the side bar, and the LoL guide from the side bar, but I'm looking for info on how to pick heroes and team comps I guess? 
2jcp0c	-59261	1413405484	wow	Spell book changes?	So I've noticed since resubbing last night that the spellbook has changed a bit. Namely, I can't find any of my passive abilities except for talents. Is this intended, or am I just missing some new setting? I'd love to see when I pick up new passives while leveling / things I've already earned. It just seems odd to have removed them.
2yxsc3	-59261	1426272766	PickAnAndroidForMe	Virgin Mobile USA smartphone help.	As the title states, I currently use Virgin Mobile USA. To my knowledge their phone selection is basically limited to their store, no unlocked phones from elsewhere. I'm not terribly knoweldgeable about smartphones but what I'm looking for are:* good battery life* root cabability or low amount of bloatware/apps* 4g capability* $500 or less.My current phone is the Galxy S3, so screen size comparible to that is cool, I'm not super interested in the huge 6inch phablet screens. If nothing really exists on Virgin like that, I'm willing to scope out some other similarly prices networks. Like I said, I'm not super knowledgable about smartphones so I'm open to any advice really.

zqv35	-59265	1347417588	anime	So I just marathoned Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari *spoilers*	Both amazing shows. All the characters were great; I liked Oshino and Karen especially. I didn't even mind that there was so much talking, hell, I loved that there was so much talking, because the dialogue was so great. The cleverness, the humor, the references... it was awesome. Maybe it's just because it's fresher in my memory, but I think I actually (unpopular opinion time?) prefer Nisemonogatari. I loved all the "real vs. fake" philosophy. Hell, the last episode in general was great. Kagenui's farewell line had me rolling...There's still a bunch of things I really don't get, though. Like Shinobu and Koyomi's relationship. Why does she call him "master"? Does she still want to kill him? But I guess that'll be answered in Kizu... which I'm platinum mad is so far away :(

Put on Sanctus and Replenishment + Sun Princess Ring to stack HP regen. Put faith at 28 for WotG, and just threw on armor that would keep my burden under 50%. So yeah, thoughts?

I'm also not sure if the mobo I selected has a built in wifi adapter, because I'm going to need one. If not, is it better to search for one that has one or should I just get an external usb one?Thanks in advance.

225ei2	-59265	1396570220	Surface	Should I buy a Surface or a regular laptop?	I'm going off to college come fall. My primary device will be my custom built PC, however, I need something portable, to take to class with me, and so on. I was leaning towards buying a Surface 2 but the specs are a bit underwhelming. For the same price, I could buy a laptop that preforms better, but I really like the portability of the Surface and that it's a tablet. However, I'm worried about the super small hard drive and amount of memory, as well as there only being one USB port (I guess this could be remedied by a splitter though). I'd also like to do some light indie gaming, but I don't know if even that would be possible. Considering all this, would you recommend I buy a Surface?

2xqgu9	-59265	1425345117	stunfisk	[RMT] Boooooomburst!	After playing around for some time in RU, I fell in love with Exploud. Boomburst was just such a great move, and with Scrappy, nothing stood in our way. The only problem was that he was just too slow. The solution: build a trick room team around him! This is the result. **Bronzong** @ Mental HerbAbility: HeatproofEVs: 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 SpDBrave NatureIVs: 0 Spe* Trick Room* Stealth Rock* Gyro Ball* ExplosionPretty standard TR lead. Set up spikes, TR, then explode. I gave him heatproof because levitate is so standard on Bronzong that no one uses EQ on him. Lets him take a hit from Houndoom.  **Exploud** @ Choice SpecsAbility: ScrappyEVs: 248 HP / 252 SpA / 8 SpDQuiet NatureIVs: 0 Spe* Boomburst* Fire Blast* Sleep TalkThe star player. I know Exploud is a little unorthodox for a TR team, but a speed reducing nature is more than enough to let him "outslow" most of his opponents. Boomburst is really the only move I use here, the rest are just side dishes. Fire Blast hits Steelix and Registeel if necessary. And yes, there are only 3 moves, that's not an error. I originally had surf on him, but really never used it. With only these 3 moves, I can switch in to an Amoongus' spore, safely use Sleep Talk and get a guaranteed KO.  **Slowking** @ LeftoversAbility: RegeneratorEVs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpDQuiet NatureIVs: 0 Spe* Trick Room* Scald* Fire Blast* PsyshockSecond TR setter. Regenerator gives him great survivability and he has some offensive capabilities as well.  **Granbull** @ LeftoversAbility: IntimidateEVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 DefImpish Nature* Heal Bell* Play Rough* Toxic* RoarGranbull functions as a cleric and phazer that synergizes really well with my team. He can switch in and take a knock off for Slowking or a mach punch for Exploud.  **Escavalier** @ Assault VestAbility: OvercoatEVs: 248 HP / 252 Atk / 8 SpDBrave NatureIVs: 0 Spe* Knock Off* Megahorn* Iron Head* Drill RunNot a whole lot to say here, Excavalier functions really well as a bulky TR physical attacker. He's already pretty hard to kill, and Assault Vest gives him even more survivability.  **Hitmonlee** @ Choice ScarfAbility: RecklessEVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 SpeJolly Nature* High Jump Kick* Double-Edge* Knock Off* Rapid SpinThe "just in case" sweeper for when Bronzong and Slowking both bite the dust. Hitmonlee's my only way of dealing with Jolteon, who completely shuts down my team otherwise. Rapid Spin is there just in case toxic spikes gets set up, which are incredibly annoying. So the general strategy is to suicide lead, get as many Boombursts in as possible, then cleanup with Hitmonlee. So far I've been having pretty good success, but dark types are giving me a hard time, especially Houndoom and Drapion. I originally had Cofagrigus to switch into a fighting move for Exploud, but he just couldn't take a knock off. I *would* like a ghost type, but I'm not sure if I can make it work. Any thoughts or ideas are greatly appreciated!

2avlyw	-59270	1405533758	MCPE	Mobs.. they need to be fixed. (ಠ_ಠ)	Hi, friends, families, friends of families of MCPE. I have come here to talk about the mobs of MCPE. First of all, they have [super powers](http://i.imgur.com/iAqnBlT.png) . They defy the laws of light and are lamps in the dark and night. Second of all, they are really [pale and whitish](http://i.imgur.com/0Y6RWJS.png) And finally, the one that bothers me the most is that they are just dumb. Villagers don't have the same AI as their PC counterparts and can't even their own doors to their houses. Also, in PC when its Normal Survival and I have no armor but a wooden sword immediately I want to find a shelter. Because those hostile mobs are dangerous! Skeletons are hard to approach because they land nearly every hit. Spiders lunge at you at a blink. And zombies are just plain scary. However, in PE, the experience is different. I don't need to find a shelter. Skeletons aren't those massive aimbots you'd find in PC. Zombies are easy. Creepers don't cover as much of a blast radius as PC. Spiders aren't hard to even kill because all the mobs are just so slow. I would rather have a more survival like experience where mobs are actually a nuisance to defeat and not just a key lime pie you finish in seconds. Thank you for listening to my stupid story.

As seen on [Minecraft Wiki](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pocket_Edition#Mobs), the mobs are slower, notice players from a small range, and overall don't act as they should. Since 0.12.0 will include sprinting, will the AI be improved to be more like the Console and PC?

3gm2vj	-59270	1439312466	MCPE	Fix Server Lag	Hi, Minecraft Pocket Edition and its community is only getting bigger and better. Not to mention Mineplex, PC's biggest server, is coming to Pocket Edition. With it's features getting very close to PC, who knows how long it will take for us to reach near parity. However, one thing that strays far off are the servers.  I love PC and its servers. They are fun, easy to use, and relatively lag free. Of course, you get lag now and then but nowhere near as bad as Pocket Edition. You get transported instantly when changing lobbies, playing mini-games etc.  PE; however, is the exact opposite. I get disconnected randomly. I find myself getting bad (not horrible) lag, sometimes even when I just press an item on my hotbar. Also, whenever you get transported to a new area to join a lobby, play mini-games, e.t.c., it always has to bring up the "Building Terrain" screen up again.  I think if Pocket Edition's buggy servers are fixed, people will look at PE at an ever greater perspective.

28zc3i	-59273	1403630676	factorio	Factorio needs proper medium range transport system. (idea from other game, video in link)	I love Factorio in current form. Still as you know game is in developement and i think it needs addition to game-play.Here is the problem:For short range item hauling belts are awesome same as bots in later game.For long range there is nothing better than Train. It gives you ton of space to fill and with "hand" upgrades it can also move ton of stuff quick. Couple that with railway network and soon you will be expanding a lot.Now what if there is resource near your base but it is to small to to create railway network for it and it is to far for bets and belts can quickly become target to biters.For medium range transport there is CAR sure but manually hauling ton of stuff is imo against idea of this game. CAR is fine for exploring, looking for resources, creating new outposts but at the same time as transport system for your resources is quite bad. Not only it is hard to handle (in case if you want to dock near hands to unload cargo) and you can easily destroy it with your res in it.Now here is idea from other game called Earth 2150.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvp4Qqpl59o#t=358There is mining drill that puts stuff into container on belt, this belt moves container from drill to place where truck can pick it up. Truck pick it up and goes to rafinery.Pretty standard for RTS overall but i think trucks or automated truck that picks up containers (same way created as barrels) would be fine addition to game.It doesn't really need AI. Fake railway system based on checkpoints would be good. Also maybe instead of trucks something like tram ?This could also go hand in hand with proper road system where players could lay roads or build mashines for auto road creation (there is already mod for railways like that).Also for those kind of truck you would need proper fuel instead of solid one as it will be more cost efficient.

2howcm	-59273	1411905305	dwarffortress	Confirmed: Two first migrant waves are no longer hardcoded. Who is starting no migrants fortress ?	After reading few posts from fellow Urists on Bay12 and here about weird lack of known hardcoded migrant waves i decided to simply test it myself.And it is true. I set up pop cap at 0 and no migrants for 2 full years.This is absolutely awesome change for several reasons.1. We can truly simulate growth of small tiny expedition to full grown city without bloating fortress with unwashed migrants. 2. It also makes game way harder in sense as to have new members of community families needs to be made then children and after decade child will join that community.3. Every dwarf is much more valuable now. Especially married couples which would be now treated as kings in society. So you would ensure for example that none of couples were given dangerous task as hunting or fushing or being in army.4. Mentioned families. Since you have more time now you can create proper communities with known dwarves. So for example families will have their own houses. Which means that you will know each dwarf by name instead of being manager of grey unknown folk. That much better storytelling can get with for example wife of Urist being bitten by warecreature and then killing her watching her children crying for her. And you will know each of those children by name.5. Since for a long time you will not build ton of wealth that will attract sieges and much harder stuff now you can build above ground proper villages for few years without need of military or traps beside few soldiers. Now if someone could now mod slower skill learning, tree cutting, mining and overall game actions slowdown it would be amazing village sumulator.From homlet to sprawling city.

2jgmlc	-59273	1413498257	dwarffortress	Playing DF without AI/pathfinding/system cheating. Who does that ?	I mean i see 99% of all DF fortresses fallow usual way.surfaceBuild wall == &gt; make door in that wall make traps == &gt; build moat ==&gt; build bridge === &gt; build level system for magma == &gt; magma moat == the endundergroundbuild tunnel == set traps == build balista at the end of tunnel == &gt; build magma level system == the endI mean it is boring. Because it uses AI inability to sculpt terrain or attack walls. So closing off completely from surface isn't a problem.Now alternative is to build wall with many doors then build sub sections of walls, fortifications and stuff that will make your fort safer instead of being cheater excuse.Naturally problem is Tantrum Spirral. BUT YOU CAN ACTUALLY CONTROLL IT. Make proper segregation of your population. Make sure that for example one big family lives in one big house with their own meeting place and workshops near it. This way people won't be friends with everybody (thus removing tantrum spiral on death of few dwarves).Make sure your military is consisted mostly of men as women can have babies on front with them.Make actually Militia where every men is in some squad and trains few months in a year. and so on.

I mean to have trade network that works you have to have those offers updated so you need to actually go to station listen same dialogue copypasta 500 times instead because for some reason in space game you don't use computer for that. I mean even in X3 you could just install satelite network that was probably faster than this shit as you could just deploy it without listening to same dialog over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.I mean what is the point of this game ? Is it fun ? HELL NO !. Is it interesting ? Absolutely no. Does it actual improve game ? no.Hell is there even one person enjoying small talk "gameplay" ? Do you devs actually enjoy playing brainless totally mundane game of click a button in right time or you will need to wait for another small talk few seconds later listening to same dialog lines over and over and over and over and over again.How about making it actually part of gameplay. I mean there are station menagers. Give them ability to sell you information as a subsription or payment in advance for every update. Trade computer logistics mk1 that will check prices in sector and then mk2 that will check prices in system and mk3 that will give you ability to monitor all prices in real time for one bilion. This is actually a game.As for talking with people leave QTE small talk out of it. It is wonderful way to present game lore to players as player will be able to talk with people instead of playing some boring game.

Sometimes dorfs simply don't want to wear it for some unknown reason.That reason is most of the time that you dorf is already wearing something and he don't want to change it.Trick: -Set your armor in squad menu how you want.-Set REPLACE instead of OVER in squad equipment menu-This will make all you dorfs only wear what you told them to wear (armor) and lose rest of clothing.-They will now equip without problems but probably will also be butt naked on some body parts.-Set OVER instead of REPLACE-Dorfs will go match clothing to their armorSo you have dorfs happy and armored without problems.This way for example you can finally set all your marksman dorfs with gepard leather trousers you dream off with 0 problems or any other combination.

But just for today. I could not deny myself the sweet satisfaction. He knows what role you play as a member of the Lodge. He will thank you for that with his famous look. And I’ll be looking at your quivering lips and trembling hands, I will listen to your lame apologies and excuses. And you know what, Triss? I will faint with delight.” “I knew,” Triss grunted, “that you would not forget, that you would take your revenge. I agreed to this because I was actually at fault. But one thing I must tell you, Yennefer. Do not count too much on fainting. He knows how to forgive.”“He knows what was done to him, of course,” Yennefer narrowed her eyes. “But he will never forgive you for what was done to Ciri. And me.” “It is possible,” Triss swallowed, “he may not forgive. Especially, if you insist. But he won’t fly into a rage. He won’t lower himself like that.” Yennefer flicked her horse with her whip in anger. The animal whinnied and leapt, and the sorceress swayed in her saddle. “Enough talk,” she snapped. “More humility, you smug viper! He is my man, mine and only mine! Do you understand? You have to stop talking about him, stop thinking about him, you have to stop admiring his noble character… As of right now, right now! Oh, I want to grab you by your matted red hair…”“Try it!” screamed Triss. “Just try it, you vindictive bitch and I’ll scratch out your eyes!” I…”
388457	-59273	1433257580	witcher	Priscilla song in polish is a bit different than eng - my translation and short info about song and its meaning	Song in polish:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL4JeCNuQ0wIt is direct translation. It doesn't naturally rhyme but text is really really good and imo way better and more logical than eng version. (especially stone heart part). It is not perfect translation as i am not native eng speaker. If someone would find problems it would be cool if that someone would clean up it.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------On trail of my scars, lead your finger so that our roads would entwine despite stars.Open my wounds, and then heal them, so they would arrange in complicated pattern of fate.From my dreams you flee in the morning, tart like goosberries, sweet as lilac.I want to dream, black curls entwisted, violet eyes wet from tears.On wolf trail i will fallow into blizzard and i will trail your stubborn heart.Because of anger and sadnes, hardened into stone, i will fire up your windswept lips.From my dreams you flee in the morning, tart like goosberries, sweet as lilac.I want to dream, black curls entwisted, violet eyes wet from tears.I don't know if you are my fate or by blind luck love bound us.When i spoke my wish, did you start to love me against your will ?From my dreams you flee in the morning, tart like goosberries, sweet as lilac.I want to dream, black curls entwisted, violet eyes wet from tears.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Song is written from Geralt perspective. It was probably written by Dendelion and it is sung by PriscillaIt's song about his feeling toward what is happening between them (very stormy relationship over 20 years with long on/off pace, cheating, anger, which could be as well described toxic)Despite above he loves her even when she hurts him and he hurts her, despite that he and her both come back to each other to again run away from each other in anger and sadness.Thus second part of song is about his wish he spoke to djin when he tried to save her in short story called "Last Wish"By the end of that story he feel for her completely and when she was close to dying he had to spoke wish to djin in way that djin would not be able to kill her. Thus he wished something that would tie their fates together (his wish is unknown for the reader)Thus song explores motive that maybe Yennefer love to him wasn't possible and only it is wish that made it possible thus rendering Yennefer love fake.Which would be even logical considering how despite all fallings they still start a new for almost 20 years like something binds them.This is especially worthwile thought because Yennefer aside from Ciri and Geralt completely doesn't show any emotion toward anyone beside spite and cold calculation. IT is only for Ciri and Geralt she shows her inside emotions.

39sejj	-59273	1434270180	factorio	Hey devs. We need better storage ! Ideas etc.	I don't mind chest system at all. I don't find them a problem.Problem is that chest feels personal. Like it is a toolbox for your stuff and not part of factory.Storing stuff in chests feels like storing stuff in single oil drums instead of awesome tanks.BUTI think it would be cool to see some other ways of storing stuff.Let's say that something kind of like warehouse or square tanker like structure which would be able to contain way more than let's say 20 steel chests.This way for example we could build much more interesting designs of factories. For example huge factory could be then devided for storage production and import parts.In current way of things storage chests are big but you need web of interconnected storage chests to hold anything more than average amount of stuff.I think it should be hard to program. Just make it without UI so that only way to put in or out things is through inserters (no manual way of putting things) and costly.

It just occurred to me that maybe Mitt Romney just shot himself in the foot again with his tax plan.  I am not currently up to date on how much income the federal government receives in income tax each year but I am guess that 20% of that number is quite large.  But is he admitting that there are a ridiculous amount of tax loopholes?I am guessing he would know best about the sheer number of tax loopholes as he most likely exploits them amazingly well.  But to me, this sounds like our current tax law needs a huge overhaul if there are that many loopholes.

My wife and I are purchasing a new home. The home was advertised as 5,700 square feet.  I noted that this seemed a bit high after going through the home.  I was told that number came from public records.  I have not validated that statement.  However, the appraisal came back and with the completed portion of the basement, it is only 4,254 square foot.  The appraisal did come in right at the sale point for reference.I understand that sometimes square footage may be off to some degree but we are looking at nearly 25%.  If the public record is in fact that far off, what is the process and is it worth it to have that changed?  If the public record does not state 5,700 what recourse can I have against the buyer for false advertisement and contract documents?  Please keep in mind the appraisal did match the sales price.Thank You.

So, I'm training for a Tough Mudder with some guys at work and one of the things we're doing while we're training is the '25 minute challenge'. Its just 25 minutes on the treadmill: go as far as you can.Right now, I'm in the bottom middle of the pack at 3.0 miles in 25 minutes. I realize that to hit 4.0 miles, I'd have to maintain a 9.6 mph pace for the entire 25 minutes...which basically seems impossible right now.I actually (mostly) hate running, but I love the Mudder and I love competing with friends. I want to hit this and 'drop the mic' on our challenge board (the best distance right now is 3.33).I have 90 days to train. Is this goal attainable? This means I need a consistent 6:15 pace...a pace I definitely can't maintain for even one mile right now (right now, I can do a mile at about 8 mph on the treadmill). Assuming I'm also doing some bodyweight training stuff along the way to get more 'fit', if I start doing intervals and actually dedicating myself to this, can I hit it? I really don't know what that pace looks/feels like, but from what I can gather...its a pretty good clip. Assuming I'm only going the 4 miles though, with intervals and speed training(which I need to figure out), and knowing my current best, should I work toward this, or should I just keep focusing on the 'getting better' each time and not try for the 4.0 before October?Thanks for any advice/comments.

We're thinking the the fast paced nature of Borderlands, along with all the crazy loot would be a great platform for a crazy marathon.The question really is, do we try this with the new game? Or stick to the tried and true BL2? I know there is more than enough content in either to fill 24 hours, and BLPS will be new and shiny, but BL2 just has a lot already laid out and defined and we have DLC we could dip into if the main campaign gets stale...What do you all think?

3cswmu	-59285	1436539298	ffxiv	Formatted Live Letter Q &amp; A	**Q1. Will there be any adjustments made to the new jobs other than machinst?**A1. We're not only looking at machinist, and we will be looking into all of the jobs based on the feedback we receive. There are already adjustments that we've begun working on.**Q2. What was the intention behind not releasing the details of job adjustments in thepatch notes?**A2. As I mentioned previously, the fundamental purpose of the adjustments that were made were based on the how all of the attributes (HP, MP, DPS, etc.) would be increased when reaching level 60. With everyone reaching level 60 and switching their equipment into gear that can be purchased with Allagan tomestones of Law and Alexander gear, I believe you can feel the increase in these attributes. Actions such as stoneskin that are based on percentages of certain attributes would risk becoming too strong as their stats continued to grow, which is why there were a lot of adjustments made for these type of actions.In the event that we were to create bosses with actions as they were during 2.0, value inflation would continue, and the adjustments were made to keep this in check.We understand the requests to release details on values and such beforehand, and we will be looking into this for the future; however, since this was the patch for an expansion, we only released the skill names.**Q3. Any plans to add new role category such as “buffer” for jobs specialized in support like machinist and bards?**A3. We currently have no plans for this. The main reason behind this is because it will greatly affect the matching in the Duty Finder.**Q4. Even though they’re a tank, warriors can deal a lot of damage, will paladin and dark knight be able to deal a similar amount of damage?**A4. The reason warriors DPS is high is because they have a debuff where they can decrease a target’s slashing resistance.As an off tank, dark knights can also utilize the benefits from this debuff’s effect and that will also allow them to output similar amounts of damage. Paladins are specialized in defense so their damage output is a little bit lower.As for how warriors can output more DPS while main tanking, paladins have strong physical damage reduction and powerful actions like Hallowed Ground, dark knights have a strong magical damage reduction in Dark Mind, so these are the differences from the job designs.**Q5. As the level cap increased, our maximum MP also increased, but it feels like the rate of MP consumption has also increased. Will this be fixed as our item levels increase?**A5. Even if you increase your item level, this will not change. We plan on addressing specific jobs that are severely hurting for MP.**Q6. There seems to be a lot of nerfs in 3.0. Could you explain the reasoning behind this?**A6. When making adjustments to the job capabilities between each role, our fundamental policy is to make adjustments so that each job is in line with each other. However, when there is a concern that certain job actions would destroy the balance of content, it’s difficult to make adjustments in this manner and there are times we need to fix them. In regards to Shade Shift and Manawall, these both made it so ninja and black mage were impervious to physical attacks, and since future content will have a lot of magic-based attacks, we decided it would be best to change their effects to what they are now to increase the fun of the content.**Q7. Can you please let us know the current progress for the system where we can change the looks of summoner egi?**A7. We haven’t been able to address this yet. We’ll need to make this work with all the actions and we’re going to start working on this, so please give us some more time. Even if we were going to change their appearance, we would need to create the effects, sound, and actions for each egi, so it’ll require some time. We’re still deciding if we’re going to add these as we’re done with each one, or add them all at once, so please be patient while we work on this.**Q8. Maintaining Enochian is really difficult. Are you planning to change this at all?**A8. We’re planning to make adjustments so that you can overwrite the extended effect when you reuse Enochian again. With this change it will feel a lot different. Additionally, we may make slight adjustments to the effect of Thunder while under the effect of Enochian since there is not much of a use at the moment.**Q9. Compared to Hallowed Ground and Holmgang, there's more burden for healers when Living Dead is used. Do you have plans to adjust this effect?**A9. This is up for consideration, instead of adjusting this action alone, we’re looking into this as if we need to adjust the special characteristics for the dark knight job. We’ll check the overall performance from 3.05 and continue looking into this.**Q10. When using the Goring Blade combo after using the Rage of Halone combo, the additional effect of Rage of Halone wears off, and I don’t know how to effectively use Royal Authority. Could you please offer some advice on the best time to use this?**A10. The idea behind this is not to be able to use all of the combos all at one time, and instead we would like players to separate their uses based on the situation. The same is true for warrior. There will be times when damage and DoTs will take priority over decreasing an enemy’s strength, so please use each combo depending on the situation.**Q11. Any plans to add new a job/class during the 3.x series?**A11. We’re currently working on adjusting the existing jobs, and don’t have any time to consider new jobs. New jobs will probably be introduced in 4.0.**Q12. The bard playstyle changed a lot in 3.0. Can you please let us know how bards are supposed to fight from here on out?**A12. Bards can attack while moving, therefore they have advantage over handling mechanics as well as the ability to support party members. Our image of bards from the development side is that by making them stationary in 3.0, they are now able to increase their DPS. However, we made adjustments so bards will be able to switch between their stances easier. This doesn’t mean that they won’t be able to deal damage while moving, and bards will understand when to switch between stances once they get used to the content, as well as experiment how they can output more DPS changing between stances.**Q13. It's difficult to find uses for bard’s Warden’s Paean. Could you tell us how we should be using this?**A13. The concept behind this is not for regular use, but instead we imagined this being used during raids and other similar situations. We can look into adjustments if there is enough feedback asking for more additional effects.**Q14. The healer equipment added in 3.0 is lacking accuracy. Will you be introducing gear with accuracy on it in the future?**A14. In regards to weapons, we removed accuracy from the weapons for all jobs. We did this to eliminate situations where you couldn't use a new weapon with a high item level because it didn't have accuracy on it. We've made adjustments to the required accuracy, so even without accuracy on weapons it should be easier to land hits on enemies. In regards to armor, at the start of 2.0 there wasn't accuracy on healer equipment, but we added this later down the line. In the future if balance adjustments are necessary we may add accuracy to healer equipment again. Also, we understand that there are situations where you will not have enough accuracy when challenging 2.0 content with 3.0 weapons, and we will be addressing this. The development team did not make adjustments as if to say that healers should not DPS.**Q15. It feels as if the fairies are curing for less at level 60 than they were at level 50. Are stats affecting this?**A15. This is because the growth curve from level 1 to 50 and 51 to 60 has changed and has been loosened. Since playing at the level 60 cap will continue for some time, we took the increase of item level into consideration when balancing their healing output.**Q16. In regards to the effect of Protect and Stoneskin, can you add some type of advantage, similar to pre-patch 3.0, for white mages?**A16. As I mentioned previously, we made adjustments to actions that were largely based on stat percentages, and due to this the identity of each job was lost when using these abilities as additional actions. I apologize for this.However, to compensate for this, we've added in a great deal of healing power.**Q17. It feels like machinist can't deal steady damage. Could you tell us how you envisioned machinst in battle?**A17. Essentially, you will continuously use Lead Shot and Hot Shot. You’ll want to use them when you get a proc. Machinist has many actions with buffs, so by gaining these buffs and using Wild Fire, you will be able to deal a large amount of damage. Additionally, as you get used to the future content, it will be important to decide which buffs to use while fighting.**Q18. It's hard to stack up Meditation while moving around inside the dungeon. Do you have plans to add an action where we can stack up to the maximum amount at once?**A18. While developing, we did consider making it possible to stack up to 5 while not in combat; however, doing this made it where they were able to output strong damage every time for individual fights, therefore, we currently have no plans for this.**Q19. Could you make it so warrior’s enhanced healing effect from Defiance extends to Tetragrammaton and Lustrate?**A19. The reason the healing effect from Defiance doesn’t extend to these are simply because these are abilities. We understand everyone’s request, however this involves balancing adjustments, so we’ll first see player feedback from Alexander (Savage) and then consider from there.**Q20. Are there any plans to make any type of adjustments for astrologians?**A20. We’re thinking of making adjustments where astrologians will be able to use Spread while not in combat, or shortening the recast time for Shuffle. We have received feedback on how Lightspeed is hard to use, and so we’re planning to make adjustments so you can clearly feel the strength of this. As for Collective Unconscious and Celestial Opposition, instead of adjusting the stats similar to other healer actions, we’ll make astrologian-like adjustments where they switch between stances. We’ll make these adjustments without waiting for Alexander (Savage).**Q21. It’s often difficult to find the NPCs and quest points for the quests in Churning Mists. Are there plans to adjust this?**A21. I definitely think we kind of over did it with the Moogle-related quests, so we will be careful in the future not to have these kind of quests. It seems like there is a high amount of hatred towards the Moogles who keep getting lost.**Q22. I don't understand the benefit of absorbing your fairy with scholar’s Dissipation. Could you tell us how to use this?**A22. This is mainly to recover Aetherflow stacks. This isn't something we envisioned to be used frequently. Instead it is an ability that can play a strong role in emergency situations.**Q23. The 3.0 main scenario quest series was really good. Can you please tell us which scenarios and dialogues you were specially particular with?**A23. In A Realm Reborn we were prioritizing the continuation from FFXIV version 1.0, but for 3.0 series we made the decision to delve more into non-player characters. While adventuring alongside them, the Warrior of Light will learn a lot about them and form a strong bond. I believe we were able to get the Ysayle’s and Estinien’s stories near perfect.Personally, we have been particular with showing how Alphinaud has grown, and we were also able to show how Estinien could be seen as an older brother figure.At times where the quest icon would over Alphinaud’s head, you could talk to Ysayle and Estinien next to him, you’ll be able to have a deeper understanding of the situation, and also, if you return back to Ishgard every time, the NPC dialogue changes, so you’ll be able to see more of their story. To make it feel like you’re actually adventuring, we added the field music during events as well. For this reason, we made it possible to listen to field music even during night time. (We had them create the night time music in three days!) We’ll continue to work hard on the story after everyone’s positive feedback.**Q24. With the new combos for dragoon there are more directional-based requirements and it’s become more difficult to play. Do you have any plans to ease the directional requirements?**A24. Since 3.0 just started, we would like to keep it as it is as there is still room for players to experiment and get used to it. However, there are situations in content where it’s difficult to execute actions from the proper direction, so we would like to make adjustments for this for Patch 3.05.We will be making job adjustments in Patch 3.05. We'll continue to make adjustments as needed after this, so please send in your feedback.**Q25. During the main scenario quests there are times the Warrior of Light is trailing behind in their actions. For future main scenario quests could you make it possible to choose what we do without affecting the outcome?**A25. We purposefully increased the options for the main scenario quests in 3.0. However, I’m thinking it might be a bit hard to have an option like “Cast cure?” pop up during an important scene. Furthermore, we’ve been seeing feedback mentioning that they wanted to choose other options during situations, but everyone has different impressions towards the options, so this is a bit difficult. However, we would like to add more options to future quests so that you can select a fitting response during important situations.**Q26. There are many popular NPCs in the main scenario. Do you have any plans to add quests that focuses on these specific characters?**A26. Since this involves some spoilers, I won't go into too many details, but for NPCs that didn't have a complete ending to their story, we’re planning to add sidequests and main scenario quests. Additionally, similar to Delivery Moogle quests, we have prepared side stories where you can learn more about this. Other than that, we have plans to post a short story up on the Lodestone, so please look forward to that. It’ll draw upon what happened between Ysayle and Hraesvelgr.**Q27. I really liked the personalities from the Doma-related adventurers quest. Do you have plans to continue these?**A27. Of course we are. There’s also that mysterious Miqo’te after completing the quest.**Q28. You can often see some type of airship flying around the Sea of Clouds...what is it?**A28. I think you'll find out in 3.1. For those that haven't seen this, keep an eye out!**Q29. It's difficult to maintain hate as a tank in level 60 dungeons. Are you planning any type of adjustment?**A29. In 3.0 we have increased the amount enmity gained while tanking based on the new actions introduced for the DPS roles. So we believe it’s not that it got harder to maintain hate compared to 2.0.However, we believe this issue will arise in level 60 dungeons because there’s the difference in item level. Also, we think it’s also due to players not getting used to the new skill rotations as well. As we move into later patches, we believe players will get used to it, however in 3.0, since it’s possible to have a gap between level 60 player gear, so we’re thinking of handling this if it seems like it’s going to be a big issue.**Q30. Is the Iksalion that appears in the Fractal Continuum related to the Ixal? If so, is the Ayatlan they are searching for during the beast tribe quest actually the floating continent Azys Lla?**A30. Azys Lla, Azyslan, Ayatlan... Talking about it too much would take the fun away from it, so I think I’ll leave it at that. By the way, if you go and talk to a certain NPC in the Ixal beast tribe quest area after clearing this, their dialogue will change. There are a lot of other examples of this, so be sure to check out various NPCs.**Q31. It's difficult to beat the Odin FATE now since there aren't many people around. Can you add new rewards to stimulate participation?**A31. Odin's level is currently level 60, so he is very strong. Please give it some time and try again.**Q32. Do you have plans to introduce an Extreme version of the final boss fight in the 3.0 main scenario quest, similar to the Minstrel’s Ballad: Ultima Weapon?**A32. Let me just say, “no comment.”**Q33. When are you planning to unlock new ranks for Grand Companies?**A33. We’re currently planning Grand Company-related content, so we believe we’ll release new ranks when adding this content. It’s not fun moving into the next rank just by collecting something, so we think it’s good timing to add new types of content when releasing the ranks.**Q34. Can you place a company chest in Ishgard?**A34. The company chest is something that allows multiple players to interact with items at the same time, so we’re carefully looking into this since it can severely affect the servers. I’m not saying that we will not place one in Ishgard, but please give us some time.**Q35. Will we be able to change our free company names?**A35. We're planning to make it possible to change your free company name in Patch 3.1.**Q36. Do you have plans to introduce a Haurchefant minion or painting?**A36. Since we're receiving lots of requests for this...let's add this in Patch 3.1!**Q37. Can you tell us the difference between Alexander and Alexander (Savage)?**A37. Both the difficulty and the item level of the items you can obtain will be different. The design of the rewards will be the same, but you’ll be able to dye the equipment from Alexander (Savage). Additionally, there will also be special rewards that will not affect the strength of your character.**Q38. Can you make it so we the Allagan tomestone and Roulette bonuses will carry over from the day before, or the week before, for the days we couldn't play?**A38. Since this affects the entire server, it’ll be hard to implement this right away, but we’ll consider this.**Q39. Are you planning to increase the rank of our companion chocobos?**A39. We do not have any plans for this at the moment. We currently planning for new content that utilizes chocobos and magitek armor, and we will be making adjustments for this.**Q40. Do you have plans to increase the potency from potions and medicines to match the level cap increase?**A40. Currently the recast and the effect isn’t matching with the level, so we’re planning to make adjustments.**Q41. Can you increase the methods for obtaining cute minions?**A41. Even if we increase the methods for obtainment, the drop rate will not change. We understand the demand, but it’s because of their rarity that they are sought after. There is an element of luck in the game, and if everyone obtained it immediately they would get bored. We’d like to keep this as an element that you can brag about.**Q42. Can you make it possible to glamour Haurchefant’s shield?**A42. Since we have many requests for this, we’re thinking of making it possible to obtain it through a future side quest.**Q43. Will Tataru ever create gear for us players?**A43. It may be that she didn't have a high enough crafting skill to make gear which Warriors of Light can wear.If it becomes available, please don't store Tataru's gear right away.**Q44. Can you add other methods for obtaining upgrade materials other than hunts?**A44. Due to the fact that you can only obtain upgrade materials via hunts, it has caused a lot of congestion and it's causing problems with party recruitment shouts. We will be adding a new way to obtain these items in Patch 3.05, and we’re currently looking into whether we can add even more methods.**Q45. I would like to be able to fly as soon as I enter a new area. Do you have plans to make adjustments so we can obtain Aether Currents easier, or be able to fly faster than the way it’s current set?**A45. We purposely made it so you can’t fly right away. Allowing players to fly right away would detract from the adventure in these areas, and because you can fly after exploring the ground, you’ll have a better sense of accomplishment. This has been set this way so that you’re able to feel a bit smug compared to those who can’t fly.We have placed the Aether Currents as quest rewards, and we tried to put these quests as the starting quests, but since there are some quests that are tied together by completing other quests, we would like to adjust these when we have the opportunity. We understand there are pros and cons for this but we would like to be particular about the gaming side, so please continue to submit your feedback.**Q46. Can you tell us about the new 24-man raid?**A46. It’s still a bit too early to discuss this. We’ll be releasing some information during the Letter LIVE that takes place during the 2 year anniversary stream. There is a hint hiding in something I said earlier.**Q47. For someone that loves FINAL FANTASY Tactics, I just can’t get enough of the Valerian equipment. Will you be adding more designs from other FFT classes?**A47. If there are enough requests we’d like to do this by fitting them in with the lore.**Q48. Do you plan on adding exploration content such as searching for treasure chests in the really large new areas?**A48. We are planning to have island exploration which is content that has not been seen before. Please look forward to it!**Q49. As an FFXI player, I was happy to see memorable enemies such as Dhalmels and Crawlers. Do you have plans to add other enemies from FFXI?**A49. Since there are many players who were attached to FINAL FANTASY XI, we would like to add more in future.**Q50. Do you plan on adding an aetheryte to the Dravanian Hinterlands?**A50. Idyllshire was originally designed to be included in the same area as the Dravanian Hinterlands, but we considered the fact that it would be heavily concentrated with players, and we decided to split the zone, which is inconvenient.We will be adding some countermeasure for this, which also includes the possibility of using mounts within Idyllshire. It might take some time, so we ask for your patience.**Q51. A lot of new equipment has been introduced, do you have plans to implement an inventory specifically for glamour, or some type of a gear log?**A51. I understand that players often carry their glamour equipment in the Armoury Chest, and because of this your Armoury is often full. We need to think about the stress being placed on the servers, but would like to somehow increase the quality of life by doing something like adding the ability to glamour from your retainer’s inventory. We’re also looking into saving the glamour status on the client side as a final measure.**Q52. It feels like the opportunity for crafters and gatherers to shine is limited since it’s possible to obtain HQ equipment from quests and NPCs sell craftable equipment. Will you be making adjustments moving forward?**A52. The development team was heavily debating the quest rewards for 3.0. However, considering that a lot of players are aiming to get through the main scenario first, relying on crafters to boost item levels would cause many to run dungeons with lower item level equipment, and cause stress since they can’t progress. Due to this, similar to 2.0, we made it so you can gear a single job through the quests and you can also purchase NQ items from the shops, so players will be purchasing HQ equipment for their second job onward from crafters. Additionally, crafters and gatherers are able to make profit by measure the needs of players. If it’s something that anyone can make, the supply will become excessive and the value will decrease. This is important to pay attention to.In Patch 3.05 we will be adding many new recipes, so I think there will be more business opportunities.**Q53. Do you have plans to ease the stats required for gatherer’s level 60 class quest?**A53. We currently have no plans for this. You’ll be able to reach the required stats by collecting HQ gear, we think of this as a hurdle for activities post level 60. We’ll consider this if it feels like it’s too strict.**Q54. It’s difficult to get four players for company crafting with a small FC. Do you have plans to remove the minimum member restriction in the future?**A54. I believe there’s pros and cons to this, we assumed this will create a flow where FC members will gather together for this, but we didn’t make it where it needs be members from the same FC, so if you don’t have enough people, please use the party finder and look for players that are willing to help. That may lead to new members joining the FC. We may remove this restriction in future, however, we do not have plans for this any time soon.**Q55. Using collectable to level is really efficient, but it’s hard to turn a profit on items that are not collectables because their prices are driven down. Do you have any plans to adjust this?**A55. Not only collectables, but other items that need to be turned in have a higher price, and in turn there are other consequences of this such as a decrease in supply. Especially when it comes to collectables, once the commotion of leveling calms down, the flow of HQ and NQ items will increase gradually, so we’re currently monitoring the market trends.In regards to gatherers, our current understanding is that it’s not difficult to make a profit. It’s more accurate to say that turn-in items are increasing in price instead of saying that items not used for collectables and other turn-ins are having their prices driven down. I believe gatherers can really profit, so please explore how you can do so.**Q56. Can you please make it so the flying mounts will bank when turning during flight?**A56. This might be difficult to do, but I think the motion team and programmers will try their best. Please look forward to it.**Q57. Do you have plans to add content using flying mounts, such as shooting, or racing?**A57. We did talk about wanting to do some type of timing-based challenges, so we’ll look into something.**Q58. Do you have plans to increase the ways we can obtain materials needed for vanity gear, so we can obtain them easier?**A58. I believe this is in regards to the Thavnairian gear, but when we previously introduced swimwear we carefully made adjustments. Because there aren't enough players at the level to challenge the Timeworn Dragonskin Map it feels this way, but as time passes it should circulate more frequently. However, we’re planning to make adjustments to the materials required for this recipe.**Q59. Will we be able to obtain more Souls of the Crafter in future patches?**A59. We do not have any plans for this at the moment. There may be a possibility for adjustments based on the conditions we see in the future.**Q60. Do you have plans introduce a minion or companion based on the young dragon we see in Anyx Trine?**A60. For companion, we need to create motions for attack, and levels, so we currently have no plans for this; however, for a minion, I’m sure the minion alliance are secretly planning this, or may be already working on it secretly.**Q61. Do you plan on increasing the speed of regular ground mounts?**A61. We do not have any plans for this at the moment. There is a high possibility that we increase the speed of flight for flying mounts.**Q62. Similar to the glamour system, can you make it so we can change the appearance of our companion chocobo to look like a different mount?**A62. We would have to create attacks and healing actions for every mount, so this would be difficult.**Q63. I really love the scenery in the new areas. Do you have plans to introduce a housing ward in Ishgard?**A63. We’re currently working to solve the inconvenience in the extended wards, so we believe it’ll be after this. This is because we think we first need to create a transfer system for players who wish to move to an Ishgard area.**Q64. Can you make it possible to share a house with our Eternal Bond partner?**A64. While this is not limited to Eternal Bond partners, we are planning to implement a system in Patch 3.1 for housemates. You'll be able to enjoy decorating, raising chocobos, and gardening together.**Q65. Will you make it possible to fly in 2.0 areas?**A65. The 2.0 areas weren't designed with height in mind, so even if we make it possible to fly in these areas, there won’t be anything to do. Additionally, to make this possible, we’ll need to make large improvements to the graphics quality to these maps in order to fly.**Q66. This might be a bit early to ask, but will flying mounts play a role in future expansions?**A66. We're planning future contents based on flying mounts, so you'll be able to enjoy them in the future as well.**Q67. Please implement a dhalmel mount!**A67. I think the mount lead would love to do this, so I’m sure he will look into it.**Q68. Would you please consider adding Vanu Vanu's dance emote?**A68. Vanu Vanu is pretty popular. Let’s get this in 3.1!**Q69. The graphics have really been able to shine with the release of DirectX 11, but will they become even nicer in the future?**A69. At long last we were able to release the DirectX 11 version, so we would like players to enjoy this version for a while. Naturally, we will do our best to improve the graphical quality.**Q70. Do you have any plans to improve the graphical quality of PS4?**A70. We’re thinking about gradually implementing code related to the DirectX 11 improvements onto PS4 as we keep an eye on stability.**Q71. After 3.0 launched, my inventory and Armoury have been super full. Do you plan on adding more inventory space?**A71. I understand everyone’s request, but since additional inventory space would increase the data transmitted, there is a risk for server crashes, so this isn’t something we can do right away. We’re optimizing aspects with every patch, so we will continue to look into this for the future. Until then, we would like to add a feature that stores and retrieves whole gear sets to and from retainers, and make other quality-of-life changes to retainers.**Q72. There are times I can’t tell if an enemy’s attack is physical or magical. Would it be possible to change the color of the damage so we can easily distinguish this?**A72. We have no plans to separate this as we would like players to investigate this as part of strategy. Also, the element changes many times while developing, therefore it’ll be difficult to do this even if we looked into making this type of adjustment.**Q73. Can you make it so the chocobo in our stables are more lively (such as sitting or” kwehing”)?**A73. While I can't answer with a definitive time frame, we would like to do this if we have the opportunity. I’ll have the motion team look into it.**Q74. Can you make it so the horns and face options for Au Ra are separate?**A74. Right now it’s not possible since separating these would stress system processes. In regards to color as well, it’s currently using the maximum memory specifications, so it would require core system adjustments. We will look into it once more.**Q75. Do you have plans to increase the availability of glove-type monk weapons in future?**A75. We're looking into further changes for the monk weapon to make it fit more to the fist. We’re looking into increasing glove-type weapons, so please hang in there.**Q76. Do you have plans to introduce an afro hairstyle?**A76. We're going to add this in Patch 3.1. We actually had it nearly ready to release, but the number of polygons were too high. We're currently making adjustments to this, so please look forward to it.**Q77. Can you increase the maximum amount of macro lines and the number of macros we can save?**A77. Macros are managed on an account-wide basis and not by individual characters, and due to this it will take us a bit of time to test to make it possible to store more macros by compressing the data. We will give an update on our progress on the forums in the future.**Q78. Do you have plans to make it possible to sell items on the market board, or send retainers on ventures, without switching between each retainer?**A78. The server that manages retainers are calling each retainers individually when you need to give orders. So calling four at once would cause lots of stress on the server. As mentioned earlier, we need to place some type of limit on the stress somewhere to get features like glamouring directly from retainer inventory. We’re considering these with the server loads in mind, so we ask for your patience. Additionally, we’re looking into making it possible to sell items directly from retainers.**Q79. How is the feature to see our party members' TP coming along?**A79. We're currently working on this so that memory is not completely consumed, and we're planning to just show the bar, not a value. We're aiming to implement this in Patch 3.1.**Q80. Can you make it so we can enlarge the flying text for 4k monitors?**A80. Chat is a separate, and we would have to create a 4k chat system, and this is something that we cannot do right away. In regards to flying text, it's possible to enlarge it up to 300%, but the resolution is lacking, so it would be pixelated. If that's okay, then we can try to do this.**Q81. Can you make it so we can set our retainers as the new jobs?**A81. It's on our task list to make it so that you can set your retainers as any of the jobs, not only the new ones. This should make it in time for Patch 3.1.**Q82. Is there anything in particular which players have missed that you would like us to check out?**A82. I'm sure lots of you already went through this, but while progressing through the main scenario, the NPC dialogue changes. For those of you that are still progressing in the story, we would like you to not rush, and try talking to various NPCs to check these out. Especially, after completing the main scenario, we would like you to talk to NPCs around Dragonhead. Also, I think it's fun doing solo dungeon time challenges, so please try it out.**Q83. Are there any plans to print the columns written by Yoshi-P in Famitsu?**A83. It depends on them, but I think there isn't enough to fill a book just yet.**Q84. With the number of aetherytes added in 3.0, do you have any plans to increase the amount of our favorite destinations?**A84. We'll be proactively looking into this if there is a lot of feedback.**Q85. What is with the small Miqo’te that can be seen in that one area? Is this something we will be able to choose as a new race in the future?**A85. Please look forward to future development. It’s difficult to implement races that have expression limitations and other issues. By the way, Lalafell’s heads are too big, so don’t treat them as children!**Q86. Windows 10 is scheduled to be released this month. I would like to know the current plan for FFXIV supporting it?**A86. We’re having the technical QA team look into this, and currently see no technical issues. Once we can confirm stable behavior, we’ll make an announcement.**Q87. When exactly is Patch 3.1 planned for? Even just an estimate is fine.**A87. We need some time to rest as well, so we would appreciate if you can wait just a bit. We'll release information gradually once we’re closer to the release date, so hang in there.**Q88. Congratulations on the upcoming release of the “Before the Fall” album! Now, when can we expect the 3.0 soundtrack?**A88. At this pace, Soken will probably collapse. (Aimed at Soken) When is it? Soken: I think we would sell it digitally first. After that, we're planning on releasing a higher quality version on disc. I would like to release the digital version close to Tokyo Game Show in September.**Q89. Please tell us the progress regarding the EU Data Center.**A89. We've finished purchasing all the equipment, and we're currently in the process of setting everything up. We need to perform various checks moving forward, but we're planning to open it sometime this year and hoping to do this around the timing of Patch 3.1.**Q90. I'd really like to listen to the field music even while engaged in battle, so could you add an option to turn off the battle music?**A90. Soken: We will look into this.**[Alexander: Gordias (Savage) Loot Rules]**It will be possible to complete each area once per week, and in addition to obtaining equipment directly from treasure coffers, everyone will be receive token items that can be used to exchange for gear. In the event that players who already completed an area are present, similar to Coil, the number of chests that appear will change based on the amount of these players; however, you will still be able to obtain the token item if you have yet to do so for the week.Additionally, in regards to the normal mode of Alexander, we've been seeing feedback mentioning that the lotting battles are rough, so we may look into increasing the amount of rewards.

1u7iiw	-59304	1388638419	Teeth	Question about my teeth.	A couple of days ago I was eating steak at a restaurant and one of my teeth on my left top side starting hurting terribly. I have no idea why and i can't see a dentist because of how expensive it is and my healthcare doesn't provide for dental. It's been 3 days and it still hurts, although is only occurs when i chew with my left side. I'm extremely worried because i don't want to mess up my teeth anymore then i already have. I haven't been taking the best care of my teeth and i'm only 15 so if i mess up my teeth it will haunt me for the rest of my life. I was wondering if there is any cure for the pain or if there is anything i can do about it?

Based on the testimonies of Casso, Massino and even Gravano they could easily build a new series that is also somewhat factual that tells people about the modern day mob. Is anyone else extremely interested to see how the main families in New York are still functioning, especially after the drastic changes beginning from the late 80s to the 1990s? 
2pw796	-59306	1419092773	Shoplifting	Almost got caught	So I have been taking from the supermarket next to me for a few months now, easily 400 euros worth of stuff. My parents basically cut me off (I study) and I am sick of working minimum wage jobs. I'm a foreigner in the country I study in, so I get treated like shit by most employers. Anyway, I (stupidly) stuffed some chocolate into the inside of my jacket last time I was at the supermarket and a staff member saw me. I saw him see me briefly (didn't make eye contact, I would look instantly guilty) and put the stuff back. Next day, I saw him watching me along with the boss. I was going to follow through and fill my backpack with stuff but then I saw the boss turn her head and just got a feeling she knew something. When I went up to pay, said employee came over, stood behind me and (I guess) tried lifting my bag a little to see if it was full, but I'm too smart for that. Today in the morning I went there with company, he worked the register and looked primarily at my torso to see if I had anything stashed (I assume).Then, 15 minutes ago, I went in again for a test purchase. Thankfully the same guy was working there. There was a massive queue and I just wanted to buy 1 or 2 things (as it was a test run) so I started putting my stuff back, then he came over saying he would open the other register. Went up to pay and he started saying about this "new policy" and "kids from school leave their backpacks outside the store, why shouldn't I". He laughed it all off, I did the same, and at the end he just asked if he could look in my backpack. What did he find? my jacket that I had stuffed it with to make it look full. Lessons learned? ALWAYS trust your gut feeling.
2tjdz0	-59306	1422127370	DotA2	How to increase the number of unique players - Volvo	The system is fucking retarded. Have to love the redditors and their "hurr durr I've never been in LP stop being a dick". Do you realize there are people making new accounts, having to mute everyone on their team just to avoid getting LP and ruining yet another account? Why the fuck should people get low priority for text abuse? the game has a mute player function AND global mute punishment. But no, you criticize anyone and you get put in low priority. You fucking talk to your team and you get fucked over for it, in a game that is 80% teamwork 20% skill. A few simple lines of code would be able to determine in a somewhat successful way if someone actually fed or if someone just reported them for feeding because their feelings were hurt (which happens all... the... time). If you're going to fuck over your oldest players with a punishment system that stacks over time at least make the system somewhat good, seriously what programmers are working at valve that they haven't figured this out in 3 years?

I have for instance friends in 4k that only get queued in very high games, however if you lose a couple of very high unranked games you drop back down to high quite fast yet they have not. Can anyone confirm?EDIT: Please only comment if you actually know how the calibration system works.

Kvaliteten på streamingen er ikke god nok for øyeblikket, og mangelen på avspillingsmuligheter utenfor pc er også negativt. Men jeg har troen på produktet, og jeg tror og håper på at etter denne ekstremt dårlige lanseringen kan det bare bli bedre. Kommer nok til å ha både HBO og Netflix.Håper dette var til hjelp, er det noe annet dere lurer på er det bare å spørre!

179c64	-59313	1359128779	norge	HBO nordic utvider prøveperioden	Fikk mail idag hvor de skrev at de utvidet prøveperioden til ut februar. De skrev også at "I februar lanserer vi støtte for Airplay funksjonalitet og HD-kvalitet vil bli tilgjengelig på enda flere enheter. Etter dette følger vi opp med applikasjoner for Xbox og andre enheter."Dette sammen med at de har lagt ut flere serier i det siste ( the office, curb, onion news network, real time with bill maher ) og atbildekvaliteten har forberdet seg i det siste ( det er bare min synsing, vet ikke om den har faktisk gjort det, men jeg merker en forbedring i kvalitet i det siste ) gjør at HBO for meg nå begynner å leve opp til potensialet sitt. Fortsatt et stykke å gå da.

I have read some Hobbes, but not a lot of Tocqueville, so any kind of input is appreciated. This question is maybe a bit "thin", but so is my knowledge at the moment.

After a while it cooled down, but the battery had gone from 90% to 10% in less than 10 minutes. It worked fine until it charged itself out (wasn't near a charger, so couldn't charge it up before it died). But now it won't turn back on. I let it "cool down" overnight, but i have kept it in a charger for a couple of hours now. It just flashes the apple logo for a couple of seconds before it goes black again.Anyone else had this problem? Is there any hope or is it past the point of rescue?

I got in to a debate with some classmates discussing the role the media plays in US politics, and how the way we use and consume media has changed drastically over the last 20 years.My argument was that the internet has been the most important change, and some argued that the 24 hour news channels also played a significant role.What i'm trying to ask is: what are your thoughts on the subject? Are we wrong? Right? Why?

Therefore you will not need to go anywhere but to the right directly to retail. Run if you want, grass wearing is fine. This said, there is no grass between retail and the train.3: You won't have time to shop otherwise, I'll have traffic and I'll want to keep you all moving through.4: I'll be saving frequently, please don't mess with my town.5: Not mandatory but I appreciate tips. I didn't buy turnips this week because they sold at 120 per turnip when I could have bought.**I'll post an update when I begin the first batch of people**Thanks for your cooperation.FC in my flair.**EDIT: THE FIRST 3 are up****EDIT2: These guys are done, but I'm going to grab dinner soon. I'll be back within the next hour/hour and a half to continue PLEASE KEEP CHECKING TO SEE IF I'VE REPLIED!** EDITED AT 6:47 PM EST**EDIT2 part 2: I'll be doing my best to get all of you done by tonight.****EDIT3: AND WE ARE BACK! alright folks, keep checking your messages to see if i've added you to the next group!**Edited 7:40 PM EST**EDIT4: THIS IS GOING SLOWLY... But I won't stop running groups through til retail closes.****EDIT5: NOBODY SEEMS TO BE SHOWING UP... and retail is about to close... So here's what I'm going to do. Tomorrow, I will update this it'll be edit 6 with the new turnip price for the day. I will continue as I was through the list with the last poster until now that'd be Ountouched.

1cd1q4	-59380	1365990549	tf2	Anyone know what to do about this user?	My absolute favorite trade servers to go on would have to be the ones hosted by Reddit. Mainly because they have a nice community, and constantly have newcomers joining. But lately, for about the last month there has been a user by the name of '[²∑z] Doppelgänger' that joins every single day. I'm writing this, mainly because all he does is constantly rag on others if he kills them. Through mic, or text, what ever. I mean, the guy cussed out a kid that was probably no more than 10 or 11 the other day. Personally, I think it's just terrible that this guy does this. At this point, I hate going on these trade servers that I used to love, entirely  because of him. I'm just sick of going on and being called garbage, fag, scrub, etc.. What I'm trying to ask is, does anyone know what we can do about it? /Is/ there anything we can do about it? All he's doing is chasing users off the server. Thank you for your time.

Lately, my team has been scrimming and trying different ways of pushing out of spawn, and nothing really seems to be efficiently working. The two most recent ways was having the combo pushing up left cliff aggressively into the sentry area next to playground as the engie and scout push the cart, and the second is where the medic stays in spawn and buffs the sniper, as the fists of steel heavy and our scout push the car while our engie uses minis to hold red back. Our medic would then come out once it clears up a bit. As I was saying, so far, these ways haven't really worked out for us. I come here asking what strategies could we use, or how could we modify the ones we are currently using.

2boj4r	-59380	1406284246	tf2	New Really annoying Glitch...	So, as of recent, I've noticed a really annoying glitch that has popped up between myself and friends. Basically, as spy, when cloaked and disguised, every so often you will be projected to another player's client side as undisguised, uncloaked, and not wearing anything. Oddly enough this happens, for me at least, from snipers. As of lately, this has happened to me about 5-7 times a day. Does anyone know of a way to solve this, or is this just something that valve has to fix? As an example, this is the only video I could find demonstrating it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3a3WVJlVU8Side note: That is purely an example, please don't turn this into a stabby love/hate thread.

38ucmt	-59385	1433628695	tifu	TIFU by getting my "gay" co-worker fired	So this happened years ago, but it recently came up in conversation and I think it's time I just came clean...At the time I was a night shift Team Lead in a dot-com department in a very large warehouse, large enough that we had our own on-site temp service. The supervisor for the temp agency was a real douche, always talking shit and screwing over anyone around him to make himself look good. We'll call him Dave. So one day Dave rolls up to our department in his little golf cart and proceeds to talk some shit to another Lead before leaving for the day. While he is distracted, I notice that his very precious planner is sitting in the golf cart, which I promptly snag. I need to point out that this planner is crucial to Dave's job. So he drives off and clocks out and I show the other Lead what I'd lifted off the cart. We start laughing and I decide to go through the entire planner and write diary-like homosexual confessions about meeting another man, being in love with him, having to hide it from my family, etc. You know, general assholery and shenanigans. No big deal. I make my way to Dave's office (door wide open) and throw the planner under his desk like he dropped it there or something. He'll find it, get mad, read through it, wonder who did it, whatever. The next day Dave looks everywhere for the planner and can't find it. I'd apparently hidden it too well, or he was a dumbass. Dave assumes it was his security guard buddy Tim who was playing tricks on him, so he goes to the security station and wipes the security guards pass-card out of the system. Tim arrives to work and his card won't work for *any* door or turnstile. Tim knows it was Dave. A warehouse manager notices that he can't get to the security station and asks him what's wrong with his card. Tim explains that Dave was playing tricks on him, no big deal, just friendly shenanigans. The manager isn't amused and immediately tracks Dave down and fucking fires him on the spot. I get to work later in the day and hear what happened from my supervisor. I act surprised and go straight to Dave's office to find that planner and remove the evidence. The planner is sitting right there on the desk, but with all important documents removed. **Fuck**. I'm in deep shit.....*They'll check the cameras and I'll get fired too*. I ask my supervisor, as casually as possible, "What did Dave's bosses do when they found out?" to which he replies "Oh, you know. Took his personal items out to him. Then they had to go through all his files, notes, calendars, etc., so they could pick up where he left off. Said they found some weird stuff in his planner". Word got out quick through the usual gossip channels that Dave was secretely gay and fucking some guy behind his wife's back, can't believe he's gay and has kids, blah blah blah. By the grace of the universe nothing falls back on me whatsoever and I get off squeeky clean. Nobody knows the truth except the other Lead. Unfortunately, Dave lost his job and all his friends and co-workers thinks he a home-wrecking homosexual. TL;DR - Cascade of shenanigans ends in a man's life potentially ruined.

Naturally assuming there will be a Libertarian (likely Gary Johnson) also on the ballot, which would you vote for and why? Also, and please correct me if I'm wrong, to maintain a third party on the ballot doesn't that third party have to maintain a minimum percentage of votes to ensure its appearance on future ballots? If that's the case, will not enough votes for the Libertarian candidate effectively remove the Libertarian option from the ballot in future elections?

At this time he was dating another girl but things weren't going well and she ended up breaking up with him a few weeks later. Her and I are now friends, and I also don't want to hurt her. Fast forward two weeks after the breakup with girl 1 and he's with his ex girlfriend (girl 2), now for about 2-3 weeks. He and girl 2 dated over a year, she took his virginity, and she cheated on him twice. He knew about it, they fought, but stayed together for a little longer, until he finally broke up with her. girl 2 is rude, sleeps around, and doesn't love him. She uses him for money and doesn't let him talk to/hang out with anyone else, not even other males. She is more beautiful than I am, but he seems to like me and I'm not way out of his range. I really do like him, he's honestly the nicest person I've met. I don't want to sit around and wait for him to break up with girl 2, I don't want to hurt girl 1, and I don't want to push him. I've been single for about five months now, my ex and I broke up on good terms, it just wasn't working out. Tl;dr: He was with one girl, they broke up and now he's back with his cheating/lying ex. I want him to see me as more than a friend and realize that getting back with his ex was a mistake.Any advice at all is great! Thanks for reading! :)Edit: for clarity

Since we started dating, my boyfriend has known I'm interested in girls, just that I've never really explored it. We've been together for about a year. He was my first; I was his second. The woman who I'll be sleeping with is a good friend of ours, as is her boyfriend. She is bi and has been with women previous. We don't plan on having contact with the men. I don't really want to sleep with any man except my boyfriend right now, which is weird I guess but it's what I'm comfortable with. We're all very close. I was just wondering if anyone else has ever been in the situation and has any advice? My boyfriend and I and my friend and her boyfriend are all very open, and none of us are the jealous type. We've all been talking about it for a while, specifically my boyfriend and I, and he's very supportive. We're both really excited, and I'm kind of nervous. So, any tips for beginning, the actual act, or even being with my boyfriend after? All help is welcome and appreciated! :)

23n6oi	-59392	1398131755	relationships	Me [17F] with my boyfriend [17M] of 1.5+ years, our relationship is falling apart.	Hey /r/relationships. I need some advice.So my boyfriend and I have been together for a little over a year and a half. I know we're young but we have always both been serious about our relationship. For the most part, we have been happy and wonderful. Unfortunately, my boyfriend (let's call him Aaron) suffers from depression. He has for the entirety of our relationship and I have always known that and tried to support him any way possible. Aaron's depression comes in waves, in that he'd be fine and happy for three months but then for one month he'd be terribly depressed and not at all his happy-go-lucky self. Whenever these months come along, Aaron is terrible. He shuts me and everyone else in his life out and acts distant and lonely. So the last time this happened, I told Aaron I couldn't do it anymore. I couldn't just be shut out and treated with zero love or affection, and that the next time this happens I want him to see a professional and seek help. Fast forward a few months and the cycle repeats itself; Aaron is depressed. Only this time, he tells me he doesn't want to put me through this and that he needs to be alone for a while. He also says he feels he needs to conquer his depression without being co-dependent and leaning on me. Aaron and I break up. Aaron is doing a lot better. He's seeing a therapist, he has a new job, and he's working on bettering himself. But I'm devastated. I have a pretty bad anxiety disorder brought on by an intense car accident I was in a few months ago (which I'm being treated for). I cannot function. Aaron was my rock. He knew how to calm me down and help me through rough times. I love him and I know he loves me. I just don't care anymore. I need Aaron in my life. We haven't been communicating at all and I feel so lonely. I was blindsided by this breakup and I don't know how to just stop talking to the person who was (and is) most important to me. Please help me /r/relationships. I need advice. I'm so lonely and depressed and I don't know what to do.---   **tl;dr**: Boyfriend and I broke up because of his depression and now I'm lost. What do I do?

While running through Whole Foods the other day, I saw they had them.  Did a little reading and realized their seasonal peak is January-February.  While in Costco today, I saw they have packs of Meyer Lemons (18 for $6), and I got a box to make some preserved lemons like I always wanted to.Since the season is ending, and theres a skid of these things sitting at Costco, any ideas on what to do with these?  I was thinking of making a few jars of the preserved lemons to give as gifts, then realized noone I know would appreciate or know what the hell to do with them.  Limoncello was the original reason I thought of it years back, but I make beer now so I probably don't really need any more booze in the house... maybe.

Spare me future spoilers id possible, please)Ned Stark, from my memory, didn't get to do much good for the realm as it stands post-ASoS.  He got himself killed, got negative Stark press, and essentially got Sansa into her mess by bringing her there.The good thing? Syrio Forel.  I just watched the "Lord Snow" episode of GoT, and it got me thinking... there's no depth to Syrio.  Ned watches on intently as he trains Arya in the show (which makes me think of another topic pertaining to the shows foreshadowing as it pertains to conversations they may have had with GRRM), but we never read or hear of where Syrio came from, or went for that matter.  We know he was the first sword of Braavos, seemingly equivalent of Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, but that's about it.  Is he alive or dead, who knows, I only just finished Book3, but my thought was he serves as one of the only positives to come from Ned Starks time in Kings Landing... hiring Syrio to teach his daughter the basis that gets her through the rest of her journey.  If we had no Syrio, Arya would surely be really dead by now.

Awesome.So, I'm looking to pack light -- but still be able to fit in multiple situations (dinners, hiking, swimming, lounging, etc.).

Anyone have any tips on what to bring or how to focus on it properly?  I don't want to not be prepared, but I'd like to be able to so as much as possible (hiking, snorkeling, swimming, etc. etc.) It'll be hot.Clothing or travel items recommendations welcome.

She has off the following week, and I'm contemplating a few days to do a long weekend of sorts, if possible.That being said, looking to depart NYC on 4/7, ideally after 4pm, and go... somewhere.  We both love to travel, love new things, love great food/drink, and both could probably use some relaxing.  The most convenient and affordable option I found so far would be taking the Amtrak form NYC&gt;Washington DC on 4/7, using some of my free nights @ Marriott to take in what DC has to offer for a few days, and come back home Wednesday 4/11.  While DC sounds enticing... like I said before... we could both use some relaxing.Any other options/ideas?  We'd be willing to go anywhere pretty much. Since it's only for a few days, we'd like to keep the cost reasonable if possible.  I have multiple free nights to use at Marriott properties, so that's a bonus if those can be used.  We're based in NJ, but like I said we will be in NYC that day so all NYC area transit options are available.

Wanted to get the opinions of some resident experts who can sway me towards the proper firearms. Granted, I live in NJ so restrictions are abound -- but I think the list represent some solid performers + home defense angles + SHTF Scenarios.  Let me know what you think.**Pistols:*&gt;.22 (cheap ammo)Ruger SR22  A .22 for general plinking, targeting, and fun.&gt;9mm/.40/.45 (Undecided)Love the SIG pistols -- once I can decide on a caliber I want to be using, It'll likely be a SIG.&gt;.357Ruger G100 - seems to be a workhorse of a DA Revolver - perfect for home defense I'd think.**Rifles:*&gt;.22(cheap ammo)Ruger 10/22.  The universally acceptable .22 that people seem to love.  Again, using .22 for general plinking, targeting, and fun.&gt;.308/.223 (undecided)Looking for a solid bolt action performer.

I like Benellis alot for some reason... and this seems to be a really bad ass shotgun to have for either home defense/hunting.

About 4-5 weeks in, after ignoring a few quirks, the game became simply unplayable.  Anything from being unable to load saved game all the way to botched, frozen trades and incorrect resource counts.  It was pretty frustrating for all involved, and most swore the game and its net code off as simply "not a multiplayer game".  My question to the group is... Has it gotten better?  Has anyone played a successful 6+ player multi game to completion?  I found the real life dynamics of trades and deals in the game creating a VERY interesting and fun experience, ripe for secret plots and real diplomacy.  Just trying to see where the game has come, from the multiplayer standpoint, from the community.

Doors: 5:00 pm / Show: 9:00 pm  Garcia’s at The Capitol Theatre  Port Chester, NY  $7.00       This event is 21 and over    Celebrate Jerry Garcia's birthday with Newton Crosby!  We most definitely will be playing some songs in honor of the big man... as well as our own blend of dance rage.  Combining influences from electronica, funk and jazz, this sextet from New Jersey has been taking on the Northeast jamband scene since 2009. Newton Crosby has shared the stage with moe., Umphrey's McGee, Conspirator, Kung Fu, Jen Hartswick, Wyllys and The New York Hustler Ensemble, Speakerbot and The Heavy Pets. Newton Crosby makes it a point to keep the music at high energy and the crowd dancing throughout the show. With Alonzo Sisco on drums and Billy Vegas on bass, together they gel in unison creating perfect conditions for improvisation. Stephen “Squigs” Minutillo and Chris Cartelli, guitars, keys and vocals, elevate the band’s sound by trading off of each other’s leads and directing the set’s musical exploration. Eric 'Eroc' Mitchell rounds out the line-up, bringing his great piano stylings and unique brand of synth sounds to the music. The recent additon of Seth Eisenstein on saxophone completes the bands sound and adds to the bands musical diversity. Climactic peaking jams backed by break beats and thumping basslines, Newton Crosby is sure to get the crowd and dance party going.[Newton Crosby live at Sullivan Hall](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKnI8hQ9y1E)*[Event FB Page](https://www.facebook.com/events/126359000907100/)*[Tickets](http://www.thecapitoltheatre.com/event/315297-newton-crosby-port-chester/?utm_source=20130703_facebook&amp;utm_medium=newtonCrosby&amp;utm_campaign=ticketLink)*Selfish Plug:Right here.*[Newton Crosby](http://newtoncrosby.com/)

I plead, I beg, I cry for a shred of evidence, and for this I am ridiculed.Ridiculed for simply wanting a basis on which to set my foot for a leap of faith.I am hated, yelled at, told to leave because of what I don’t believe,And because I want to think for myself, and not conform to the mass delusion.To what extent is this justice? To what concentration is this liberty, or freedom?People tell me I need to be fixed, although I’m not broken.People tell me I need to be saved, although I’m not in danger.People tell me I need to be born again, or see a new perspective,But nothing compares to the feeling I felt whenever I let it all go.A feeling of awe, and wonder. A feeling of mystery soaring through my veins.This emotion could only be described as enlightenment,And yet I get hated, yelled at, and told to leave for it.For attempting to think inside of the box,Take a step back,And see the world for what it truly is.

I could dedicate an entire AMA to just this.  •	The Spirit of Oscar P.  “Hey Oscar P” is a rallying cry for Tarleton students. Tradition holds that John Tarleton (our founder) had a pet duck (Oscar P) that followed him everywhere.  This duck embodies school spirit and the Purple Poo raise his spirit from student body. [see it]( http://www.myspace.com/video/megs-rip-lg/oscar-p/3169360)•	Homecoming week.  There are dozens of events that occur during homecoming week. Some highlights include Silver Bugle Hunt (Tarleton scavenger hunt), Yell Contest (each organization performs cheers in front of the student body), Beat the Drum (we bang a drum 24 hours a day from Wednesday evening until kickoff of the homecoming game on Saturday), and Bonfire.•	LV Risenger Bonfire.  Tarleton started being Bonfires for their annual game against North Texas Agricultural College (now- UT Arlington) in the early 20th century. Rival NTAC did the same thing.  In 1939, Tarleton students drove to Arlington and prematurely lit their bonfire in the middle of the night.  In retaliation, NTAC students loaded into a trailer and attempted to storm the Tarleton campus.  A couple of students with pilots licenses got a plane from a nearby air field, flew to Stephenville, and proceeded to drop home made phosphorus on the Tarleton campus in hopes of lighting the bonfire.  Tradition holds that LV Risenger brought down the airplane with piece of wood from the bonfire and alerted the Tarleton administration about the incoming ground assault.   No one is certain on the plane came down, but it did and they have pictures with the piece wood in place. •	More can be found http://www.tarleton.edu/studentactivities/documents/TarletonTraditions.pdf________________________________________Campus and Surrounding Area________________________________________**City Population:** 15,000. Stephenville is a small ranching town located between Fort Worth and Abilene.  Known as the Cowboy Capital of the World, it produces Tarleton graduates, rodeo cowboys, and lots of dairy.  –Rather than a skyline shot, I give you [Moola]( http://images.topix.com/gallery/up-E0LU1L9T2S1D40O3.jpg)**Iconic Campus Building:** [Nursing Building]( http://schooldesigns.com/Portals/0/SD_Images/Projects/1111asu035a.jpg)**[Stone gates and walls](http://www.tarleton.edu/virtualtour/landmark/rockgates_gallery/album/Tarleton%20Wintry%20Mix%20333.jpg).**  Tarleton Students have invested their blood and sweat improving the campus. Senior classes leave their legacy a variety of ways.  Classes during the 1930s build a stone wall and numerous gates around the footprint of the original campus.  They are a very visible reminder of doing your part to improve your community. **[The Smoke Stack](http://media-cache-ec4.pinterest.com/192x/21/17/2d/21172d23a8d53ed525c73e5c47425354.jpg)** Its hard to miss it when you are on campus.

It was the oldest Dr Pepper Bottling plant in the World until Dr Pepper Corporate sued them from refusing to switch their branding and recipe.  For more than 100 years, Dublin Dr Pepper made DP the original way with Pure Cane Sugar rather than Corn Syrup.  Corporate was not happy about them using their own branding and forced them to close.  The Soda shop remains and sells their recipe as on site fountain drink________________________________________**Random Trivia**________________________________________•	The Purple Poo (founded 1921) are the oldest university spirit group in the state of Texas.•	Tarleton has a nationally recognized rodeo program with 7 Team National Championships, and 19 individuals•	WJ Wisdom’s 86 game win streak was the intercollegiate record for most consecutive wins until John Wooden of UCLA surpassed him.•	John Tarleton was a miser who was known for being cheap.  Rumor has it the only reason he started the school was to tie up his estate so his ex-wife wouldn't get the money•	Tarleton started as an independent college in 1899, but came under Texas A&amp;M in 1919 and remainded a member of their system since that time.•	Tarleton Basketball is sometimes called the Duke of D2. The students line up along the baseline and stand for the entire game.  In past decade, they made it to the NCAA tournament 9 times,  Sweet sixteen 4 times, #1 ranking in 3 different seasons, and hold a .800 win percentage at home.

Jake Fenske was our backup quarterback last season.  He came up after our starter was injured, and proceeded the sling the ball all over the field.  It turns out that he is back for an encore senior season. I don’t think we win the conference, but if he can keep us healthy, I can see us making the playoffs this year.________________________________________**Famous Alumni**Earl RudderHal Mumme, Grandfather of the Air Raid OffenseRyan Bingham, Grammy Award winner (Texas Country musicican)Chris Kyle, Most Lethal Sniper in American History**[More information]( http://www.tarletonsports.com/)***Subreddit:  /r/Tarleton Contributor: chrisattsuPlease upvote this thread even if you are not interested in the team so that users who are interested will see itFor more information on the 132 Teams in 132 Days Project, click here.

I love/hate playing the Dirtybirds.  We're 40 miles from each other and both schools recruit the San Antonio area heavily.  It is close enough that the fanbases travel to games throughout the year on each other's campuses.   We've played all sports (except football) for 20 years.  We played our first football game against each other in the Alamodome and UTSA won.  We will continue to play Olympic sports against each other, but football is unlikely for the near future due to conference realignment and scheduling issues.* Defunct Rivals: Playing at the FCS and D2 levels for so many years, we had rivalries with Sam Houston State, Stephen F Austin, Texas A&amp;I, and Nichols State.  However, the move to FBS has caused those rivalries to go dormant. ****2012 Season*    ***  **Record:** [4-8-0]( http://txstatebobcats.com/schedule.aspx?schedule=89&amp;path=football)    **Coach:** Dennis Franchione [**2012 Roster**]( http://txstatebobcats.com/roster.aspx?roster=93)    **Key Players:** Shaun Rutherford (QB), Marcus Curry (RB), Andy Erickson(WR/ PR), Jafus Gaines (WR / KR)**Biggest Plays:** [Marcus Curry 73 Run to the House against Houston.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0okJ_ZDA210&amp;t=36)****2013 Season****    [**2013 Schedule**]( http://txstatebobcats.com/schedule.aspx?path=football&amp;tab=football2)    8/31 [](/southernmiss)   9/7 Prairie View A&amp;M   9/21 [](/texastech)   9/28 [](/wyoming)    10/5 [](/louisianalafayette)  10/12 [](/louisianamonroe)  10/19 [](/georgiastate)  10/26 [](/southalabama)  11/2 [](/idaho)   11/16 [](/arkansasstate)   11/23 [](/westernkentucky)   11/29 [](/troy)[**2013 Roster**]( http://txstatebobcats.com/roster.aspx?roster=119)****The Greats* ******Greatest Games:** 2005 - Game against Georgia Southern - First game of the NCAA playoffs (first time Texas State had been in the FCS playoffs) against a team with 6 National titles.

TXST QB Barrick Nealy brought us back and we ended up beating the Eagles and advancing to the NCAA Semifinal game2012 - Houston, You've got a problem.  - First game as a member of the FBS.

It is lit after every victory and on special occasions such as graduation.  * Floating the River / River Raft Race - The San Marcos River springs from the ground on campus and flows all the way to the Gulf of Mexico.  It is crystal clear and 72 year old. Students flock to the river throughout the year and float down it on toobs.  In the Spring Semester, a couple of the local fraternities host the River Raft Race. It’s an open float for anyone who wants to attend and draws in college students from all over the country.* [Jumping in the River on Graduation]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3qeLpM0oJI) – Graduation is held in our arena (Strahan Coliseum) next to the river.  After graduation students head out to the river and jump in while in full regalia.  ****Campus and Surrounding Area******City Population:** 50,000[**City Skyline**](http://www.texfiles.com/sanmarcostexas/leftA.jpg)   **Iconic Campus Building:** [Old Main]( http://www.maps.txstate.edu/campus/buildings/om/contentParagraph/0/content_files/file/om.jpg) – Built in 1903, it was the first building on our campus.[Sewell Park]( http://www.txstate.edu/virtual-campus-tour/tour-stops/sewell/contentParagraph/0/content_files/file0/sewellpark.jpg) – Not a building but a landmark none the less.  Students hang here most days, soaking in the sun, swimming, floating, people watching.**Local Dining:** [The Square](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3109/2292670165_f659a05594_z.jpg) – The Courthouse Square is two blocks from campus and littered with bars, coffee shops, and restaurants.  Anyone visiting San Marcos will likely come out here for some post game activitiesGills Broiler – Greasy Burger joint, known for the Manske Roll.  A cinnamon roll with plenty of butter.Dos Gatos – The Czech tradition of kolaches is alive and well in San Marcos.  They have fruit filled and meat stuffed (like pigs in a blanket) that I would put up against West any day of the week (strong words for most Texans).Hays County BBQ – Voted one Texas Monthly’s Top 50 BBQ joints.  They also have a location in the stadium to munch on during game day.****Random Trivia***** Texas State receives more applications than any other school in the state (besides UT and A&amp;M)* We are the only university in the state to graduate a US President – Lyndon Johnson * Other Famous Alumni include – [George Strait](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Strait), [Powers Boothe]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_Boothe), Texas Country Stars - Randy Rogers, Kyle Park, Charlie Robison, Terri Hendrix, Todd Snider.   * The campus is built on a hill top.  The highest and lowest points of the campus are separated by 240 Feet of elevation.  * You see a lot of wildlife on campus between the river, caves, and hills surrounding the campus.  Coyotes, Bobcats, deer, snakes, fish turtles.    We have two endangered species whose ecosystem only exists on our campus (The San Marcos Springs Blind Salamander and a strain of Texas Wild Rice) .****What Is and What is to Come****Texas State is entering our fourth conference in four years (Southland, Independent, WAC, Sun Belt), but we are finally in a stable FBS home.  Coach Fran and his staff are in their 3rd season and have hit the recruiting trail hard and brought in some solid classes. We transitioned from a Pro-style offense under the former coach to Fran’s Option and the personnel hasn’t quite caught up.  We’ve got a rough road ahead of us in the Sun Belt.  The conference produced several bowl teams last year and finished ahead of CUSA in the ESPN Power rankings.****Overtime****If you get the chance to Roadtrip San Marcos, do it.  A TXST roadtrip consists of slowing down to explore the Texas Hill Country. We are 25 minutes from the Austin airport/45 minutes from San Antonio so driving (or renting a car) is a good idea. San Marcos is college town with the state's largest outlet mall (wives love it), natural activities (hiking / crystal clear river). Bobcats love to party, so the tailgates kickoff bright and early on Saturday morning (sometimes Friday night).    Our 7pm kick offs allow you tailgate all day or go explore San Marcos, visit nearby Austin (big city / state capitol atmosphere), Lockhart (BBQ Mecca of Texas), Gruene (Oldest Dancehall in Texas for two-stepping and german cooking), or Wimberley (eclectic art community in the hills) before or after the game.We are in an area that loves to party.  Depending on when you come to town, there is usually a festival going on somewhere within 45 minutes of San Marcos.  ACL Fest, Fun Fun Fun, SXSW (all Austin, but 30 minutes away).  Wurstfest - A 10 day beer/sausage festival is November is 15 minutes away.  Craft Beer lovers --  Central Texas is the heart of the craft brews for the state. You can get to 40+ breweries and wineries within an hour of San Marcos. Most of them sell their products in San Marcos* Per Amador's request -  San Marcos's unique culture has allowed oddities like [Frisbee Dan](http://smmercury.com//wp-content/uploads/2009/02/frisbeedan1.jpg), [Dylan the Sun God](http://bobcatfans.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/5-12-cover-288.jpg), and [Dancing Todd](http://smmercury.com//wp-content/uploads/2009/05/dancingtodd.jpg) to become household names.    Dan works in landscape around San Marcos and ends up in Sewell Park every afternoon.  Like Wooderson from Dazed and Confused, he gets older and the girls stay the same age.  All he wants to do is have someone to play frisbee with.    Dylan is always shirtless with headphones in his ears blasting trance music.  His golden complexion and constant up upward gestures (like 'raising the roof') has caused people to call him the Sun God.    Todd - Works for a local apartment locator service and draws in business by dancing on the side of road.*****[Fan Site – Bobcatfans.com](http://www.bobcatfans.com)*    *Subreddit: /r/txstate*    *Contributors: /u/chrisattsu , Bobcatfans.com*********Please upvote this thread even if you are not interested in the team so that users who are interested will see it**   *For more information on the 132 Teams in 132 Days Project, [click here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1930fe/132_teams_in_132_days_mega_thread/)*

This would be my first build, moving on from the laptop I have for gaming, which as good as it is, I'm looking for something better that will be able to hit 60fps consistently on higher settings and I think this set up would do fine.

I will be running games at 1080p and I want to be able to run games at the highest settings, if it helps this is the monitor I will be using http://www.asus.com/uk/Monitors_Projectors/VG248QE/I've been reading about this VRAM issue with 970's but since I'll be running in 1080p is this something I'm likely to ever notice?Another thing is coil whine, is this something that's really common? Would I be better off getting just one 980 instead and then getting another for SLI in the future (wouldn't be able to get 2 right now due to budget)And on a side note is there any part of this build you would recommend changing? Since it's my first build I wouldn't want to be getting anything that doesn't really boost the performance of the PC.Thanks.

For the vast majority of the time I have had it there have been no issues. However for the past few weeks it disconnects, seemingly for no reason, it is happening so often and I am tearing my hair out trying to solve the issue. The connection will show as limited, if I click 'troubleshoot problems' it fixes itself. Shortly after this the same thing will happen, it will show as limited, if I click on 'troubleshoot problems' it will not fix it, it will say that there are no connections. The only way to fix it is by unplugging and plugging it back in. Doing this means that the cycle repeats but is an instant temporary fix.On average this will happen five times a day. Is this something I can fix? Drivers appear to be up to date. I can't say there was anything that coincided with the problem, i.e no recent hardware or software changes.System specs:Intel i5-4990K8GB RamWindows 8.1 64 BitGeforce GTX 980Asus Motherboard

3fmotd	-59424	1438616437	Fitness	Improving running time within a week.	Needing some advice, I'm new to running and I've only been on 8 runs. Each run is 1.5 Miles and the goal is to complete within 12 minutes. Currently my fastest time is 14:14 which isn't good enough. I normally do this run every second day. I have a fitness test  in which I have to finish under 12 minutes in a weeks time. What is there that I could do to improve my time?I find myself getting tired out around .8 mile mark, my thighs hurt and I start to lose my breath. It takes about 7-8 minutes to get to this point.Many thanks.

34xjgd	-59427	1430826316	Fitness	Just started 2 weeks after my mates.	Hi! I'm 15 and my mates conned me into joining the gym, I finally did it on monday (2 days ago, I'm aussie). We had a 1 hour training session which was fun and stuff I did basically everything, mainly abs and arm muscles. The next day I felt sore, my muscles oh god it was very bad and my stomach it was bad as well.  But I continued and went to gym again, today same time 3 - 4:30 takes us like 20 minutes to walk there from school. Today I worked on my legs and did some canyoning shit and bike riding. Got home and around 8 holy shit I couldn't even sit down, like I had to fall over to get in bed. What even is happening my mates did not experience this at all and still continue to go every day. Btw I am not the hulk, this is my first time at gym.Edit: Just woke up and holy mother fucker I can't sit down at all I thought yesterday was bad, nigga I feel like a paraplegic with broken legs and abs and the whole lot!

Ok so I have never had a blood test health check up nothing before in my life only thing I've had is my immunisations (I am 15 years old 16 in september) and I was feeling my testicles and felt a small pea like lump and I just googled away and that scared the shit out of me testicular cancer and all that bad shit. I want to really get checked out how do I go about doing this I live with my nan and can't say "Hey nan my balls have pea sized lumps in them and I want to get it checked" that's awkward probably would work but ugh help how do I do this? Last time I went to the hospital the one and only time I've actually been in there for my own problem was when I scraped my arm and hit my back and that was only a couple of hours.

She has a bf	So I met this girl who is in one of my classes at school right (Year 11) We instantly clicked and shit, same weekend we went to the movies. I found out she had a bf was sad and all, but we still continued to click. She never friend zoned me. I literally stayed at her house in her bed nothing happened but hugs and spooning and laughing and shit. Next week we went to the show, and stayed at her house again and she stayed over all weekend. We got into a deep convo aye told me how she knows I like her and she likes me back right, but doesn't like to give up on people, obviously her bf. She used to try and complain about him but I just told her straight up to get that shit outta here because that aint my problem. We never did anything, as I don't want to be that asshole who steals girlfriends, but I do but I don't but aisjdiasjdkas fuck.tl;dr: We both like each other but she has a bf and doesn't want to dump him, he's also an asshole and has anger issues. (That doesn't matter I could put that cunt in the ground)EDIT: Well fuck she told me her friend was coming over which clearly didn't happen as her friend went to a party so I assumed that then I saw on her bf's facebook she went to her house as there was legs in the background on his recently updated cover photo an hour ago. Like two legs on his bed fuck her she already lying to me and we aint even together.

I see now that, because there are two very different types of woods, I probably should have used a conditioner first.  My staining technique obviously needs some work.Luckily, this is a very cheap piece of our home (railing into our garage), so I am free to experiment.Are there any ways to fix this other than simply removing and starting over?  The colors of the vertical rails are darker and more inconsistent than the color of the horizontal beam.ThanksLINK TO PHOTOS: (one original included)  I don't think the photos really demonstrate how much darker the vertical railings are than the other.

20phty	-59433	1395137373	leagueoflegends	Map Rotation Suggestion?	So there was a post showing how blue team would win more games than purple team and so I thought about this and I think that there are a few reasons for this.#1) If you started out playing Co-Op vs. Ai games, I think our brains gets used to playing on blue side, because in Co-Op vs Ai, the player always plays on blue side#2) The HUD is always at the bottom, so looking at a "downwards diagonal" angle is disadvantageous to purple side.  Especially in bot lane on purple side, you lose a lot of your screen (I have my HUD at 35% and sometimes it still blocks out things)So what if the player was able to rotate the map.  If any of you guys have played Hearthstone, each player plays in the perspective of the person on the bottom of the screen (imagine how it would be if you had to play upside down).  What I mean is when you're playing on blue side, you look from bottom up, and when you're playing on purple side you also look from bottom up.  Here's what I mean:When you're playing blue side your minimap would look like: http://cubeupload.com/im/cVifYf.pngWhen you're playing on purple side your minimap/map would instead look like: http://cubeupload.com/im/A9UDr2.pngNow there are a few flaws to this and that is, top lane would essentially have to play "bot lane," and bot lane would have to play "top lane," from their perspective.Alternatively, I think a more plausible solution might be, in Co-op vs. Ai games, the player should be able to play in purple side sometimes, training up people to play on both sides.Edit: new image links uploaded

At first I thought it was only me, and I couldn't reconnect due to firewall error, but after repeatedly trying to reconnect in my first game, the "game is still in progress" goes away from my lolclient and my match history doesn't have that game recorded, meaning that the game didn't count.Then right now I'm in a ranked game, 30 minutes in I disconnect and then keep retrying to reconnect until this happens:http://tinypic.com/r/20izb0w/8This is further proof that it wasn't just me that disconnected.  It means that we all disconnected at 30 mins and tried to reconnect at the same time, which is why all of us are loading in, even though the game already elapsed for 30 mins or so, so it's not just me.  What's happening?EDIT:After trying to reconnect over and over, the same thing happened to my ranked game, I was playing Fizz in ranked, but the "game is still in progress" is gone and the match history is gone, all 10 of us disconnected:My match history – http://tinypic.com/r/2l92uj5/8Caitlyn's match history – http://tinypic.com/r/2q061qh/8It's like we never played that ranked game.

36y9ik	-59433	1432350735	summonerschool	How do you close out games in Silver?	So I play a lot of top lane and when I get a few kills on my opponent, I ward up and push while I can 1v1 the enemy top laner and possibly 1v2 top+jungle.  I take out first tower and inner tower.  Then at mid game we start grouping.  However, against comps like Ziggs+Morgana support.  We aren't able to push as Ziggs keeps poking us down while wave clearing.  We get a few picks with our Blitzcrank+Vi+Annie+Ashe+Me(Riven), however we still aren't able to push.  They manage to stall the game out and beat us in a teamfight through poking us down really hard.  How do we close out games when the enemy has so much wave clear and poke?  At a certain point, my team, I could tell, was getting afraid of fighting them because of the Ziggs poke.  So when Vi finally ulted Draven, I went in but the Annie, Blitz, Ashe were reluctant to fight, they kind of just ran away to be honest while Vi and I died.  Should I have kept split pushing?  But when they send two players top, my 4 other team members still are not able to push due to Ziggs, and I back off safely, but nothing happens.

Could a community successfully fund itself by making donations to programs designed to help operate things like schools, police, fire, etc?I only wonder because I constantly hear people saying things like: "I wish I could pay taxes for the things I feel are beneficial, but there is just so much I pay taxes for that I'm opposed to."Is it possible for me as an individual to "donate" enough to different organizations that I can write off most of my taxes I would have to give to the IRS?  If so, could a community conceivably do this collectively to fund all their local programs and other programs they deemed needed?

Here's the list of shows I've watched so far.  **The shows I loved:**Star Trek: The Next GenerationStargate UniverseBattlestar Galactica (reboot)Firefly**The shows I really liked:**Star Trek: Deep Space NineStar Trek: VoyagerStargate SG1Stargate Atlantis**Shows I found more entertaining than not:**Star Trek: EnterpriseStar Trek: The Original SeriesBattlestar Galactica (original)LexxI enjoy reruns as much as the next guy, but I'm at the point where I've watched the above so many times that I'm not glued to my chair anymore.  Stargate Universe was the last show I really looked foreward to (I know the show was polarizing, but I also was coming to the realization while it was running that "Reality TV" was taking over, and this might be one of the last decent Sci-fi attempts made), and now it is cancelled.800 television channels, and not one show about people travelling the stars having adventures.Am I missing any gems?  Have I run the well dry?  If anyone can help, it's /r/startrek.
lb4hb	-59475	1318532096	Naruto	My prediction:  Who is Tobi? (spoilers)	Tobi is the shell of Obito, controlled by Uchiha Madara.My reasoning:1)  Uchiha Madara was alive long enough to know Nagato, but not know that he had died.  He was controlling the Fourth Mizukage and lurking in the shadows in the lives of Yuhiko (he claims got the idea to start Akatsuki from him) and Nagato (he claims to have given him his rinnegan eyes).  2)  Madara is expecting to be resurrected by Nagato.  In 559, he makes the comment that Nagato the brat has grown, and "this must be...", clearly pointing to that fact.  It isn't until he's told about the impure world resurrection that he knows something went horribly wrong.3)  Zetsu keeps an eye on high ranking ninja and their cohorts for Madara, and would have been keeping an eye on Minato and his team (Obito, Rin, and Kakashi).  Obito is crushed on his right side, losing his right eye.  He gave his left eye to Kakashi.  Zetsu could have very easily retrieved the corpse and brought it to Madara, who would have interest in an Uchiha body.4)  Tobi's right side seems almost dead, as losing an arm seems not to phase him.  5)  We know Tobi's right eye belongs to Uchiha Madara.  Itachi programmed Sasuke's sharingan to use Amaratsu if he ever saw Madara's mangekyou, and it does indeed happen in the presence of Tobi.  6)  We never see the Impure World Resurrected Madara Uchiha's right eye.  It remains covered by his hair.7)  Obito has the Time/Space trait, as displayed by Kakashi's sharingan.  Madara is seen using the same traits of late, of which he could do so in the possession of Obito's body under his control.  It has been shown that implanting someone elses eyes into the body of another Uchiha will combine the two mangekyou sharingans.  In essence, Obito's will be fused with Madara's, allowing Madara's new eye to have all of Obito's old (or would be future) abilities in combination with his own.  8)  We know the white Zetsu can transfer and store chakra.  We do not yet know what the black Zetsu's abilities are, but it isn't a stretch to assume he could transfer chakra from Madara to the corpse of Obito.  We also know that cloning is an ability of Zetsu.  All these things lead me to suspect that Tobi is the shell of Obito under the control of (or intentions of) Uchiha Madara.  The body of Obito has been given Madara's right eye, and given life by Zetsu.  His sole purpose was to ensure the resurrection of the real Uchiha Madara, but somewhere along the way something went wrong with Madara's plan.Tobi seems not to care anymore about resurrecting Madara (at least I suspect).  I also suspect it will be revealed that Tobi is a monster out of even Madara's control:  with all of Madara's powers and more, grown from Obito's latent powers and that of the new rinnegan eye.  Madara's intentions remain in tact, but Tobi now sees himself as more than the original Madara, so there is no reason he'd accept orders from a resurrected version.Destroy my theory please!  I'm a fan of critique.  
mcikl	-59475	1321322289	occupywallstreet	How will OWS evolve, and what will it evolve into?	Occupy Wall Street, and its associated movements in cities around the country, have made us all aware that we're not alone in our feelings of discontent for what politics and corporations have done to America. Unfortunately, what should be a rousing hype gaining more and more energy is being portrayed as a fizzling fad by most media outlets. The message of the protest managed to get out, but was purposely drowned in a vast sea of incongruent ideals, chosen to be showcased by those who all society would clearly not choose to emulate.And the unfortunate truth is OWS is slipping back away to obscurity. For all intents and purposes, no one outside of a major city (most of the country), has any idea if there are 10 people marching on, or ten thousand. This obscurity has caused many who might have been willing to join the movement to fall back to their normal lives of complacency, as to them, it is what everyone is doing.Even more so, OWS has failed to gain the support of many who would participate in enacting change, yet have responsibilities to families to continue to work for fear of losing their jobs to someone else. I am one of these people.I am against the use of violence against other people, and yet, I am also against the support of passive aggression.  Goals have objectives, deadlines, and consequences for inaction.And here we are, at the turning point: **The camp out has gotten as much of the message out as the media will allow. At this point, will it evolve into something more? What will happen if the people are completely ignored?**We know from past experiences that if we take a pledge for future change as our acceptance to back down from our demands, then that future pledge will never be met. Politicians will always favor making the problem someone else's.**So how does a non-violent protest evolve past getting the message out?** Unless defeat is acceptable, which, I hope, most will refuse to accept, how does a society force change with non-violence?And when, as we all know will happen, violence (note, being arrested, removed, detained, etc is violence) is used against us to intimidate most into backing down, how will we ensure that our own members are protected?

The shortage would cause gas prices to spike to over $5 per gallon this summer, with the potential for it never to drop below that figure again.This morning on the Today show, they announced that gas prices are on the rise: expected to be over $4 by April, and easily at $5 this summer.  They brought in an expert to speak on the matter, and said expert was asked specifically: Ann Coultier:  "Who is to blame for the gas price increase?"Expert:  "The price rises are due to instability in Iran, and will not be remedied until Iran abandons its nuclear program."................what?

qcab4	-59475	1330568272	sto	YSK how to gain all the benefits of the best fleets without being in them	A large fleet offers many benefits a smaller fleet cannot, however it often lacks an interest in personal investment among all its members.  Fleets that will mass invite anyone without any knowledge of their personality welcomes conflict between people.  Factions form, cliques split, drama happens.  The smaller fleets on the other hand grow very slowly.  New members are added sparingly and only when members know and like someone.  There's no need for votes on things, because everyone who gathers in the fleet shares a similar mindset.  The feeling between members is that of old friends.  Every time you run something with them, you have fun.However, most people think that larger fleets are the only way to get what they want:  people who know what they're doing to cooperate with in game activities.  In fact, larger fleets often hoard players who don't know what they're doing yet, and frustrations mount.  It becomes impossible to teach so many people at the same time, and only serves to create more of a divide.  Truth be told, you can have all the benefits of a large fleet while in one with few members.  This is done through the use of chat channels, of which STO is very diverse.  With them, you can be part of some of the most involved players in the game with the aspects that interest you.  Here's a list of some of the best:**EliteSTF**  -  Filled with players who run elite stf's and know how to run them well.  They do every one with a strategy, and are looking for people to join them all the time.  A great place to look to fill a small group as well, if only a few from your fleet are available.**Accolades**  -  For players who like to grind titles and accolades, but hate the solitude of running them.  Group up with others who also like to get them done.**Dorado**  -  For new players who need help with missions, have questions, or are looking for advice.**STORP**  -  For players who like to roleplay, and are looking for other roleplayers.  It is an out of character channel allowing you to plan meetups for roleplaying, and still be in a fleet with your friends if you don't roleplay all the time.  **OrganizedPvP**  -  For PvP players who are sick of losing in PuG's.  **RedditChat**  -  Allows you to be part of the Reddit community in STO without feeling like you have to be friends with everyone who browses the site.  The best part of Reddit is that you don't have to agree with everyone or be best buddies with everyone.  You can speak your mind, and even in differences still be part of a whole.  This channel lets you keep a loose association without forcing you to watch what you say on Reddit for fear or stepping on toes.  If everyone on Reddit.com hung out IRL, the content would suck.  I myself am in a small fleet of people who all get along, and have the same level of maturity and humor, likes and dislikes.  I run elite STF's all the time with the help of the EliteSTF channel and am wildly successful.  I RP on occasion and with the help of STORP, I know where other RP'ers are and where to find them.  I PvP often with the help of OrganizedPvP and win most all the games we play, or lose games that are truly epic and not just because I'm stuck with baddies.  I make conversation in RedditChat and feel connected to this site, but am miles away from the drama that comes with the diversity of mind that reddit brings.  No matter what fleet you're in, find these channels you enjoy and take advantage of them.  And if you find that your fleet suddenly becomes the thing you enjoy the least, don't hesitate to leave it to find one you like.  It is a game, after all.  If you're not having fun, you're not doing it right.

For weeks now, the highlighting story has been that gasoline prices are about to spike to over $5.00 per gallon in the United States.  When asking all of their "guest experts" what the cause of this is, they respond by saying a variety of different things which essentially blames Iran for existing.Now, I recall not too long ago reading an article about a bill that passed recently that would allow large investment banks to purchase barrels of oil and create a false shortage, effectively driving up the price artificially.  There was some outrage over this bill that went through, because it was clearly not in the best interest of the citizens of our country as a whole.Now I am by no means an expert on anything (except maybe if you need your house repaired or renovated), but I do try to have conversations about it with people who like to buy in to the idea that Iran is completely to blame for the upcoming gas prices.  However, as soon as I try to open my mouth on the subject, I end up sounding more ignorant than the people I'm trying to convince.  Can someone who knows more about this connect the dots from A to B to C for those of us who aren't as on top of it?  I feel like this will be a very hot topic issue in a very short amount of time, and want to be prepared to explain who is really to blame as people start banging the war drums at the pump.

szlxf	-59475	1335786170	TeraOnline	What's up with the character controls?	I love the game from what I've played in the head-start, but I haven't purchased the game yet.  I actually like that when you select a move, you follow through with the entire thing before you can do something else or move.  It means that players actually have to think about what they're about to do, and discourages cookie cutter rotations.  It also discourages button mashing.  It may feel like you lose control of your character for longer animations to some, but I personally enjoy the play style it creates.  What I do not like is the WASD controls in conjunction with the targeting recticle.  If I've focused my targeting recticle on something and hit an attack, my character will still swing whatever direction he happens to be facing instead.  This wouldn't be so much of a problem if characters could back-peddle and strafe left and right.  What good is a mouse-operated targeting recticle if it doesn't indicate that you're facing whatever it's set upon?  The fact that I can hit the A key and turn to move away from something, but keep my targeting recticle on the thing I'm killing is counter intuitive.  And when I want to move back from something huge, I literally have to turn my back to it and run, instead of keeping it in front of me.  I played a bit of a lancer, and was frustrated by my inability to block when trying to move, simply because I couldn't face the right way while moving.  It essentially requires an extra directional tap every time you want to reposition, and just doesn't feel fluid at all.  Combat looks wonky and amateur because you see fierce fighters in combat stances unable to step to the side in fierce combat.  Imagine a movie where characters in a sword fight scene couldn't sidestep or back up.  Instead they physically turn completely around and run away, only to turn around again and take up an attack posture.  It just looks and feels ridiculous.  Other than that though, I do love the game.  Tanking and damage dealing is much more fun than target system type MMO's.  Most of my friends are claiming it's the greatest MMO since WoW, but these are also the same people who swore to be that Aion was amazing.  Then again, I haven't been as impressed by a game since... ever.  TL;DR:  Great game, character controls suck.

tpt6y	-59475	1337168455	fantasybaseball	Our custom league; anyone else play in one?	10 team, head-to-head, points, divisions**Custom Rules:****Keepers:** Using the pre-season rankings provided by the service (locked in 2 weeks prior to the draft), players are ranked by what round they should be drafted in.  For example, players ranked 1-10 are first round players, 11-20 second round, etc.  Teams can keep up to 5 players from the previous year, giving up the draft pick where that player would be ranked.  For example, Matt Wieters was ranked 93rd overall (10th round), and I gave up my 10th round pick to keep him.  To make things even more interesting, owners may only keep one player ranked between rounds 1-3 and two players between rounds 4-8.  **Incentives for winning:**  Winners are allowed to drop the value of their keepers to that of one round later.  For example, Matt Kemp was kept by a winning team last year who was able to secure him with a second round pick, thus keeping his first round pick intact.  Only the first, second, and third place teams get to do this.  First place can do it with up to three of their keepers; second place with two; third place with one.  Used strategically, it can be a huge bonus for the following year, making the Championship bracket very competitive.  **Draft Order:**  The losers have a roll to play as well during the playoffs.  The Consolation bracket determines the first four draft picks for the following year.  7th place (winner of the consolation bracket) drafts first, then 8th place, 9th place, and 10th place.  Afterward, the Championship bracket drafts in reverse order, drafting from 6th place to 1st place (having the last pick in the first round).   Using this method, every team has a reason to want to do well during the playoff weeks.  **Trading:**  Our league also allows for trading of draft picks.  They must be traded on a 1 to 1 basis, but they do allow for a great deal of action in the league.  It has also almost eliminated any need for "is this trade fair" talks.  Winning teams have incentive to want to trade away draft picks to win, as the keeper bonus is well worth it.  Losing teams who feel they are out of it become prime sellers, and ensure that the next year they can better contend.  As an example, I was a losing team last year (I came in 7th), but before the trade deadline, I managed to move some pieces that had value, securing 6 extra picks between rounds 4-9.  As such, this year my team is much stronger, and I'm enjoying success at 2nd place.  The one catch is that you lose the pick for the round you give up, so you cannot draft using it or hold a keeper in that round.  *This is the third year playing this format, and everyone seems to be loving it.  We use Yahoo, and it allows for very easy use, with a bit of work required by the commissioner to ensure players sign up and select their keepers in a timely manner (my own requirement is that keepers are due one week before the draft).  Interest is high by all owners without the need for a wager or cash reward.  Everyone plays through an entire season, and has something to look forward to for the following year if they manage their teams well.*  *I'm curious if anyone else plays with custom league rules, and what they are?*

tziwm	-59475	1337707534	offmychest	Not sure where this path will lead	My parents were wonderful and raised me well.  I have nothing but fond memories of my childhood and adolescence.  I was brought up with a support system that assured me that my life was special, and I could become whatever I wanted to be.  And here I am, approaching my 30th birthday, completely disenfranchised.  I was an above average student in high school.  I've graduated from college twice.  I have a pile of debt that could sink a ship, and a job I hate to show for it.  I've never had a boss who considered me anything but expendable, despite the fact that it is the effort of myself and other expendable people around me that allow them to succeed.  I put in extra effort, and it is never enough.  I'm overworked, underpaid, and have no where to go.    And unfortunately for the world, I'm not a person who has self-esteem issues.  I don't hate myself.  I despise self-loathing, self-victimizing people who ask questions such as "why me?"  I despise people who are the opposite as well, who try to convince me that their success is a product of hard work and willpower alone, and had nothing to do with luck or who they know; that if only I could really dedicate myself to something, then I'd find the same success that they have.  Throw the lot of them in a fire, and I'll toast marshmallows around them while they burn.  But more than that, I hate that everyone I know talks about life as though it's simply how things are going "this time around".  That I should just hang in there, and things will be better next time.  Or that they're not happy, but oh well things will be better next time.  I want to grab them by the throat and shake them, hoping with all my might that they'll realize that there is no next time. What's more, there's a whole generation of people in the world who feel like I do, but are made to feel like they're the minority.  The world media in every form tells us that we're to be ashamed of ourselves.  If you're unhappy, it must be because you can't afford the trinkets that everyone needs to distract them.  It tells our parents to shun us for not being what the "supposed" average person is.  We voice our opinions that something seems wrong with the world, and we're met with the disapproval that instead, we're doing something wrong.  Perhaps we're lazy.  Perhaps we're depressed.  There are pills for that you know.  Or we could see a therapist about it, and they'd be happy to take what money you have left from loan payments to explain to you why the world is fine, but your perspective is off.Only I don't think my perspective is off.  And I'm all done pretending that the most important part of life is living as long as you can, no matter what that means.  I'm done believing that everyone makes a difference, and your job defines your success in life.  I'm not sure what is important, but I know this isn't it.  Everyday I come closer to stepping away from it all.  To hell with my college loans, I don't intend to repay them.  I closed my bank accounts and could care less about "owning" anything.  I purchase almost nothing anymore.  I think about famous poets who gave everything up to live alone in the woods and think:  "That sounds pretty nice".  I'm not a paranoid person, but I can't shake the feeling that the world has caught me in its trap when I was ignorantly unaware, and now it won't allow me to just walk away.  But even if slowly, walking away is what I've decided to do.  It's probably the first thing in my life I've been willing to die for.Freedom

wee54	-59475	1342034049	Fitness	Turning 30, planning to use the r/fitness tips to help me feel younger.  Any recommendations?  	I'm 29 years old (for a few more weeks, anyways), 6'0" tall male weighing 215 pounds.  I've worked construction for 8 years, so I'm not entirely weak, but I have started to obtain a nice set of love handles and a belly.  I also notice that my strength is entirely centered in my "pull" muscles: specifically my biceps and back.  My "push" muscles are much weaker, and to be honest I can barely do 5 push-ups in a row.  My stamina is also much lower than I'd like it to be, and I find myself winded when performing certain tasks.  My goal is to accomplish the following:1)  Increase my stamina.  I'd like to be able to maintain cardiovascular activity without needing a break after 10 minutes.  2)  Increase the strength of my core.  I have no strength in the core of my body, and it forces me to lift objects in ways that cause me stiffness and pain.  3)  Achieve a body weight that is healthy and relatively easily maintained.  I'm 30, and I have very little free time.  I have no interest in killing myself just to "look good".  If I'm healthy and feel good and strong, I'm not going to lose sleep over whether or not I have a six pack.  Using some things from the r/fitness guide, I'm considering the following routine:In the morning, 5 days per week:phraktured.net's stretching and mobility programs  cool running's "couch to 5k running plan"Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:starting strength "basic barbell training" routine (I read the book)I know that starting strength says not to do too much cardio and that I'm supposed to drink a gallon of milk per day, but I'm not really going for the "lift until you're an olympian" goal.  However, it does seem like the very best way for core and strength conditioning, so I doubt it would be detrimental to mix it into a routine of healthy eating and cardiovascular excersize.  I do have a few questions about this all, though.  Will I miss any muscle groups doing just these things?  For example, will I need to still individually work my biceps, shoulders, back, abs, etc?  Or will starting strength work everything equally?  Also, is being able to run 5k, 5 times per week, enough to improve my cardivascular stamina, or should I continue to push for longer distances when possible?Any suggestions that people may have would be appreciated.  
z0kuh	-59475	1346241974	fantasyfootball	12 team league, I drafted 11th.  RB's and QB's went fast...	QB:  Robert Griffin IIIWR:  Larry FitzgeraldWR:  AJ GreenRB:  Frank GoreRB:  Michael TurnerTE:  Greg OlsenWR/TE:  Kenny BrittK:  Alex HeneryDEF:  Green Bay PackersBN:  Peyton HillisBN:  DeAngelo WilliamsBN:  Andrew LuckBN:  CJ SpillerBN:  Martellus BennetBN:  Jacoby FordHaving both rookie QB's probably wasn't the smartest plan, but there are still a couple decent options on waivers that might pan out in Dalton, Flacco, Fitzpatrick, Bradford, Cassel...  I was going to be taking a flier on QB's anyways, and figured RG3 and Luck would have to throw a ton this year, and maybe one would emerge as a star.  I had targetted "better" QB's, but found them gone when my picks rolled around.  These were the only two I wouldn't have had to reach for.My running backs would be great if the year was 2009.  I draft RB's who play for teams that have a solid D and run the ball.  Gore and Turner are older, but hold the bulk of the carries on teams who run the ball when they take a lead.  My hope is that one of them has a Fred Jackson-style re-emergence to ffb relevance.  DeAngelo Williams has some upside as Jon Stewart is injury prone.  Spiller and Hillis are fliers, but Hillis is supposed to be a better back this year, and Buffalo seems adamant that Spiller is the future RB for the team, and will give him his share of opportunities.  My WR's were my first two picks, and probably the most solid part of my team.  I would like to know that Kenny Britt will be a-ok going forward to start the season.  Jacoby Ford will be gone this week via waivers, meaning that I'll need to find another WR4 option who can fill in for Britt if he misses time.My TE's are bad.  Nothing was available, and I didn't make any attempts to reach.  My last picks of the draft went TE, TE, Kicker, DEF.  Olsen might get more action with Cam Newton being more comfortable in the pass, but there's competition at TE on the team and no clear leader at the moment.  Bennett might have potential, as he'll be Eli's TE target on the giants now that last year's TE is gone.

[Waivers based on Yahoo! projections](http://i.imgur.com/lCLmr.png)[Waivers based on last year's totals](http://i.imgur.com/4woKX.png)Basically, Kenny Britt is suspended 1 game, and I have a WR/TE slot that needs to be filled.  That aside, there is also question about Britt going forward after having 3 surgeries since he last played.My TE's are abysmal (Greg Olsen, Martellus Bennet, Dallas Clark), and I'm not sure I can get away with playing two of them each week.  Any sleepers or unknown studs people are high on this year outside of draft quality?  I'll be creeping on the waivers all season to try and poach a rising star, but I'd welcome some guesses early :)

(custom rules)	So here are the rules:  When I choose to keep a player, I have to give up the round pick in which that player is ranked.  I can keep up to 5 players, but only one ranked between Round 1-17, two between Round 4-17, and two between Round 9-17 (there are 17 rounds).  10 team points league, I have the second pick of the draft and draft order snakes (2nd pick on odd rounds, 9th pick on even rounds).My Team from last year:Giancarlo Stanton - Round 2Cliff Lee - Round 4Jay Bruce - Round 4Adrian Gonzalez - Round 5Brett Lawrie - Round 6Chase Headley - Round 7Ben Zobrist - Round 7Matt Moore - Round 8Matt Wieters - Round 9Austin Jackson - Round 9Asdrubal Cabrera - Round 10Dan Haren - Round 11Jon Lester - Round 12Mark Teixeira - Round 17Paul Maholm - Round 17Justin Masterson - Round 17Joel Hanrahan - Round 17 ---------------------------------------Giancaro Stanton seems like a no brainer.  He's ranked as an early Round 2 pick, and I can keep him with the 19th pick overall.  I also don't have any other options for a pick in the first three rounds, so he's pretty much it.  Past him, I'm up in the air about a lot of players.  ------------------------------------------Lastly, because of our trading rules, there are some first rounders who I know cannot be kept this year by other players.  Available are:Miguel CabreraMike TroutMatt KempPrince FielderRobinson CanoAndrew McCutchen(Votto, Braun, Pujols, CarGo will be kept)Of them, who should I keep?  My gut says that the first two picks will probably be Trout/Cabrera in some order, should I be happy with either of them?  Thanks in advance, reddit!

This is as true for new players as it is experience players.  Don't fall in love with a ship or build before you can try it out!**2)  The best ship builds allow the ship to be what it wants to be, not what the player wants it to be.**  If a ship is performing poorly, it is more likely that it is being flown poorly rather than it being a poor ship.  The best PvP'ers don't pick a design and stuff it into a ship, they pick a ship and build a design around it's strengths.  **3)  Try out established builds made by other PvP players before you custom make your own builds.**  They work for a reason, and while you will eventually want to add your own custom changes, you NEED to play the standard builds to understand how your custom changes affect your success.  If you have no point of reference, you can't accurately assess your own build.  Some players feel this is a cop-out, but the truth of the matter is, most new PvP'ers think they have a solid point of reference for a build, and in actuality have no clue.  **4)  Keep it simple!**  Do one or two things, and do them well.   If you can't do something well, don't try to do it at all.  Afterthoughts on a ship never work.  Complexity on a ship never works.  The best ships use simple concepts, and dedicate everything to that goal.  Remember, you play as a team!  No team benefits from a ship that does everything mediocre.  **5)  There are always going to be people who are better than you, and situations that you can't win.  Try anyways!**  Practicing against impossible odds will make you better and support good gameplay habits.  Even if your loss is assured, try to take something from the loss:  do a bit more damage, land a kill before you lose, keep your ship alive a few more seconds.  These are the things that translate into PvP success.  As you get better, these habits make all the difference.  No one starts out good at PvP.

Do people want ship building, tactics, equipment discussion, up-coming changes discussion to organization of more pre-made grouping?Are people more interested in general guides, or more one-on-one assistance for PvP customization to their own play styles?I suspect there is a large group of players who are interested in PvP, but feel excluded for reasons of lack of trust in their own skills or lack of interest in selling out what they find to be fun.  I'd really like to invite these players in and explain to them that they have the skills, they just don't know it yet.  And that the possibilities are endless when it comes to builds, and they can still feel unique and hold their own.I appreciate all the feedback.

And when you participate, do it with the intent of succeeding.  The people on your team are invested to the idea of fun competition.  Fielding a team with less players, or with a shuttle craft on the team, or with a person refusing to equip shields, is demoralizing and not fun.  There are plenty of easy ways to earn dilithium and fleet marks, so leave the PvP queues and find another if your intent is to phone it in.  **Don't warp out of an Arena match, don't drag out a loss:**You will face off against some really good pre-made teams from fleets who do nothing but PvP.  They will paste you 15-0 quickly and repeatedly.  Those who are getting pasted become angry at them, and often seek to enact revenge by either leaving (so they have no targets to kill) or constantly running around the map to drag things out.  The mistake here is that the pre-made teams are often portrayed as being trolls themselves, when in fact most are not.  What they want is to face off against another pre-made team in competition:  someone who will provide them with a challenge.  Unfortunately, they will also face off against a lot of unorganized pugs as well.  It isn't any more fun for them than it is for the pug.  * Remember that pre-made teams aren't evil, or trying to troll you.* Try to learn something from your loss (strategies, skills, etc)* Don't take it personally.  They aren't out to get you.**Don't abuse mechanics that aren't intended or are exploits:**An example of this from the past would be the Jem'Hadar shields, which wrongly took advantage of duty officers to make them nearly invincible.  Or the romulan ground duty officer that single handedly cut all space cooldowns in half.  Or the mine exploit where if one mine crit, they all crit, leading to tricobalt mines being a one-shot kill to any ship with the roll of the dice.  You get the picture.  If something in the game isn't working as it is intended, don't abuse it.  You will face others who do abuse it, but that is no excuse for you.  If every PvP player did things because "other people are doing it", the entire aspect of the game would dissolve into nothing. **Do onto others as you'd want done to you:**New aspects of the game are introduced that are often very successful in PvP, but that are frustrating and un-fun when used against you.  If you have ever been the victim of an Anti-matter spread team, or a Scramble Sensors team, you know that not being able to participate is a horrible feeling.  So before you equip those things on your ship because they're effective in PvP, ask yourself:  how would I feel if this was done to me?  If you would be frustrated beyond belief, then don't inflict the same frustration on others.  It only leads to escalation.**Try not to feed the trolls:**There are trolls in PvP who make it their purpose to exploit every broken and un-fun mechanic just to get a response.  If you warp out, they are happy.  If you fly in and don't try, they are happy.  If you make a comment in zone chat about them, they are happy.  They talk trash so you will talk back.  They talk trash so you will get angry.  While very hard to do, try to contain yourself and don't give them the satisfaction.  Fortunately, there aren't many of these types of players, so you won't deal with them very often.If you see someone trolling, afking, suiciding, shuttle-heroing, please right click and "Report to GM".  One or two reports may not do anything, but if enough people do the same, then repeat offenders will eventually incure the wrath of those who moderate such things.      
1c4r0j	-59475	1365685309	sto_pvp	Mentoring Program: one-on-one sessions	I'm offering a teaching course for custom ship building and play in PvP or PvE.  Sessions can be scheduled for any time you and I are both available.  They will typically require 1-2 hours of time (unless you are able to use Teamspeak, in which case the sessions are able to flow markedly faster). If interested, please sent me an in-game mail to vox@voxaroth, and I will contact you as soon as I can.---------------------------------------------------------------**How the mentoring program will work:**There are no "cookie-cutter builds", only foundations for building a ship upon.  The first questions I will ask you will help to figure out what you want to do.  Either:* What role do you want to play (to help us pick you out a ship)    OR* What ship do you want to play (to help understand that ship's role)We start with this because there are roles that only some types of ships can play, and some ships that can only fill one roll.  Ultimately, this is the first lesson I'll attempt to impart:  You can't force a ship to be what you want it to be.  Escorts, Cruisers, and Science Ships each have a role they're suited for.  Taking them outside of those roles will leave you with a ship that is good at nothing.But cheer up!  There are lots of ways to build each of these ships in the roles they're designed for, and a lot of ships do have several optional roles.Once we figure out what role is right for you, we'll work to build and understand the basic foundation for the ship:  That is, we will equip it with the bare minimum of skills and equipment that every ship should have before leaving spacedock.  Instead of simply telling you what to do, I like to make sure you understand why these abilities are essential to your success and survival, so that should you make changes in the future (which you will), that you'll recognize which things simply can't be removed.After that, we will cater to what you find fun.  My goal will be to simply attempt to build upon whatever theme you enjoy while trying to keep yourself from stretching too thin.  Instead of having lots of themes, I will attempt to get you to stick to one, and reap the benefits that come with utilizing it to the fullest.  -----------------------------------------------------------------**Equipment:**You don't need to be Mk XII purple loaded to be an asset to your team, despite popular opinion.  I will help you get outfitted with what you need, should you be lacking.  We can also make a wish-list of items you may want to work towards.------------------------------------------------------------------**Keybinding and Macros:**The best part of my tutorial!  I will figure out how you play, and build you custom keybinds for all your abilities.  I'll make it easy and tailored to you specifically, all you need do is copy and paste what I send you and listen to a quick explanation.When I'm through, the game will feel completely different for you!  No more staring at the skill bars!  You can actually enjoy the artwork of the game, and steer your ship.

As with anything though, it's easy to become biased to a conclusion, and I figured you all would be a good source of commentary on my thoughts before I posted them in the feedback section on the official forums for review.  Thanks in advance to anyone looking them over, and as always, I appreciate any recommendations you may have for content, better organization or wording of thoughts, etc.I'm no essay writer ;)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Data from the new EPtX tribble server (using EPtS as baseline):* 3 copies EPtS: 100% uptime * 2 copies EPtS: 89% uptime (active 40 seconds, down 5 seconds, repeat)* 2 copies EPtS, 1 copy EPtW/A/E: 80% uptime (active 40 seconds, down 10 seconds, repeat)* 2 copies EPtS, 2 copy EPtW/A/E: 66% uptime (active 20 seconds, down 10 seconds, repeat)* 1 copy EPts: 45% uptime: (active 20 seconds, down 25 seconds, repeat)Honestly, for ships running 2 copies of EPtS, a 5 second window isn't very large, and there are plenty of ways to survive. If that 5 seconds is still unacceptable to you, 1-2 Damage Control Engineers will do a fair job of removing it entirely.All this change seems to do is completely uncouple using 4 EPtX abilities (2 and 2) to stagger a permanent buff. Since most escorts and science ships don't use these anyways, this really only affects cruisers.Were cruisers in need of a nerf?Cruisers in PvP make fine pressure DPSers (with A2B) and dedicated healers.  They do this in PvE also, and make fine tanks as well. The dedicated healing cruisers tend not to use 4 EPtX anyways, so they won't really be affected. The A2B cruisers on the other hand will have to choose between dropping EPtA or accepting a 66% EPtS uptime.  The cheaper "dragon-build" style cruisers are now effectively dead, for all intents and purposes.For everyone else only using 2 copies of EPtS, while you gain a 5 second window where your resistance drops every 40 seconds, you also gain 50% more healing from EPtS! (Why, you ask?) Instead of gaining the heal twice per minute, players will gain the heal 3x per minute. There may be a small window of vulnerability, but overall healing just went up.Lastly, no longer being able to stagger two different EPtX abilities is a nerf on the higher levels of those abilities as well.  Why?  Because the ensign tier of engineering bridge officer abilities is 80% EPtX, and the other ability is Engineering Team 1.  Since Tactical Team is still a requirement for survival, Engineering team would be wasted.  So, if you take an EPtX 2 or 3, you're basically accepting that all your ensign slots will be useless.  In closing, this really seems to be something that will only affect cruisers, which I don't think was the intention of the change.  I'm not saying the change shouldn't go through.  But if they do,  I think that there needs to be alternate changes made to engineering boff abilities (especially at ensign) to help make up for this glaring loss to the ship class.If those are coming and we just haven't been informed of them, kudos.  This worry could all be for nothing.  But if they're not, I sincerely suggest having a look at the Emergency Power abilities again.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Also, rewording it so that it isn't a wall of text would be appreciated :)

Also, as cloaked ships are becoming more popular, a higher chance to see them while cloaked never hurts.Starship Subsystem Repair: 3 Points* Your subsystems will be taken offline by a variety of different things in PvP.  This will ensure they come back online much more quickly, even with just 3 points.-------------------------------------------------------------**Recommended Equipment:**Elite Resilient Fleet Shield [ResA] or [ResB]* Resilient Shields take 5% less damage overall, and 5% less bleedthrough to the hull.  Shield healing is very potent in PvP, so the cap is less important than simply reducing the damage that needs to be healed.* The [Adapt] modifier will stack (quickly) to reduce incoming damage by 20%.  This is the most important and powerful aspect of the shield, and will provide the most survival of any competing shields.Assimilated Borg Engines and Deflector (2 piece bonus):* Will provide a passive hull heal chance to your ship which is very frequent and effective.  Even if there are better individual deflectors and engines, the bonus from this set will bridge the gap and more.Neutronium Alloy:* You will want at least 1 of these, but no more than 2.  With bleedthrough damage, disruptor type procs and abilities (-damage resist), and subnucs being prevalent, you will want to keep your energy damage resistance around 30-45%.Plasmonic Leech:* Free power.

This drains a great deal of power, but can be overcome by timing it with Directed Energy Modulation and the Marion Frances Dulmur duty officer, who provides weapon power resistance.  * Especially effective when used by ships with a cloak which can set up the attack while hidden, as it takes more conscious effort to set up.Photonic Shockwave to strip off Extend Shields:* Added benefit of the disable from the Photonic Shockwave:  it will clear Extend Shields from the user and their target, dropping their shield resistance greatly.  -------------------------------------------------------------This list will be updated, edited, and added-to over time.

Here's an explanation of how each affects the cooldown of the most common abilities used, as well as how it relates to not using them at all.-----------------------------------------------------------------**30 second cooldowns / 15 second global cooldown abilities*** Beam Fire at Will* Cannon Rapid Fire / Scatter Volley* Attack Pattern Beta* Tactical Team66% Buff uptime:  2 copies of an Ability 55% Buff uptime:  1 copy of an Ability, 2 A2B, 3 Technicians44% Buff uptime:  1 copy of an Ability, 1 A2B, 3 Technicians33% Buff uptime:  1 copy of an Ability-----------------------------------------------------------------**45 second cooldowns / 30 second global cooldown abilities*** Emergency Power to Shields / Engines / Weapons / Auxiliary100% Buff uptime:  2 copies of an Ability100% Buff uptime:  1 copy of an Ability, 2 A2B, 3 Technicians95% Buff uptime:  1 copy of an Ability, 1 A2B, 3 Technicians66% Buff uptime:  1 copy of an Ability------------------------------------------------------------------So what does this all mean?**If you only have a few Tactical abilities**Two copies of A2B is probably right for you.  While having 2 actual copies of the tactical abilities would provide a better output, odds are this isn't an option because you don't have enough tac slots to make it happen.  55% of FAW2 and APB1, for example, is going to be better than 66% FAW1&amp;2 mixed.  **If you have more Tactical abilities at your disposal**A single A2B (or no A2B) might be right for you.  You'll get more out of just slotting 2 of the same Tactical Abilities, and since you have the tac ability slots, this is no problem for you.  **What about EPtX abilities?**95% is only a 1-3 second gap, and is more than acceptable.  Running 2 copies of an EPtX ability, 1 copy of an EPtX ability with 2 A2B's, or 1 copy of an EPtX ability with 1 A2B is fine.

I've been casually reading up on some of the new content (and the PvP forum-complaints) to see what's interesting.PvP is apparently still broken as ever, but I heard that there was new content to be played in PvE and thought I'd inquire a bit about it from people who are in the know (you guys and gals).  How much content was actually added for PvE?  Is there anything that people would consider especially challenging?  Is it more of the same (grind for marks), or did they add some content that requires slower progression for better rewards?As a benchmark, I consider "No Win Scenario" type content to be the most challenging and fun.  Is there anything new that rivals this?Anyways, thanks to those who respond, and I hope everyone is doing well.-Voxy

Google searches revealed that Origin's "Cloud Storage" option was mucking me up, so I disabled it and restarted my computer:  no problems, full week of no crashes.This week:  Slowly increasing quantity of DirectX Errors.  Loading into a game is a 50/50 chance of a game crash with said error message.  While in game, will play fine for a while (no consistent timing here, sometimes minutes, sometimes hours) before the screen freezes up.  I should specify that only the BF4 screen freezes up.  The rest of my system is unaffected, and aside from having to manually shut down BF4 with the system manager (which then spawns the DirectX Error message), it runs everything else fine.  My GPU is a GeForce GTX 660, benchmarks fine, is relatively new, handles everything else with ease.  I run speedfan to check temps after freeze-ups, and the card (and everything else) is comfortably at a brisk ~30C.  I've updated to the latest drivers (again).So what's the deal with this?  I found a [forum thread](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/forum/threadview/2955065217714259404/16/) , but am not sure if a resolution ever came of it.  Anyone else for PC have this problem?

(example: If you have two copies of Attack Pattern Beta, using one will place it on a 30 second cooldown and the other on a 15 second Global Cooldown)**The Basics:**• Auxiliary to Batteries - Transfers Auxiliary power level to Weapons power, Shield power, and Engine power.• Very Rare Technician Duty Officer - Upon activation of A2B, reduces the cooldown on all bridge officer abilities by 10% (cumulatively), but cannot reduce any cooldown below the minimum GCD for that ability.----------------------------------------------------------------**Standard vs. Advanced A2B setups:**• Standard:  A2B I (x2), Very Rare Technician Doff (x3)• Advanced: A2B I (x1), Very Rare Technician Doff (x3) (note: It is highly recommended to any player considering using A2B II on certain ships to instead use the Advanced setup instead)**List of Bridge officer abilities EXCLUSIVELY reduced to GCD using Standard setup** (All bridge officer abilities can be reduced to GCD using this setup)Beam Array: OverloadTactical TeamTorpedo: High YieldTorpedo: SpreadTarget SubsystemsAttack Pattern BetaCannon: Rapid FireCannon: Scatter VolleyDispersal PatternsAttack Pattern OmegaEngineering TeamAuxiliary to StructuralExtend ShieldsScience Team**The remaining Bridge Officer abilities not on this list are able to be reduced to GCD using the Advanced setup of A2B (x1) and VR Technician DoFF (x3)**---------------------------------------------------------------**Analysis of a Standard setup A2B cruiser:**Abilities that are only reduced to GCD by Standard setup:• Attack Pattern Beta• Tactical TeamAbilities that would be reduced to GCD by both Standard and Advanced setups:• Beam Array: Fire At Will• Emergency Power to X• Reverse Shield Polarity• Directed Energy Modulation• Polarize Hull• Hazard Emitters / Transfer Shield StrengthSince damage is important, Standard setup cruisers use two copies of A2B in order to get the most out of Attack Pattern Beta and Tactical Team.  But as the analysis indicates, the remaining abilities most often used do not gain any benefit from the second A2B ability (beyond the weapon power benefits from the ability itself).  This is why the Advanced A2B build has started to become more common with captains who utilize ships with more tactical bridge officer capability (the Scimitar, for example).  With the addition of the 6th space DoFF slot, newer builds are also arising that utilize duty officers to reduce Tactical Team and Attack Patterns, where the second A2B may not be as necessary).For almost all of the more common cruisers, Standard setup A2B is still the right choice for maximizing damage.  However, there are quite a few tactical-heavy cruisers that can match (or in some cases, outperform) them with the Advanced A2B setup.  -----------------------------------------------------------------**Common sense in an A2B world:**• Science abilities are hard to use with A2B unless you can find a means to keep your Aux power consistently high, and reliably high when you need it (on demand, rather than cycling tells you it's available).  Most people find this just isn't feasible.  However, practice and timing with the Advanced setup has led to some interesting options.• Ships with 6 or more tactical abilities already have enough tactical slots as to not need A2B.  Some niche builds may call for it from time to time, but they are usually attempting to gain A2B's benefits for only one or two abilities outside of the tactical skills (most often seen in PvP).• Just because you can A2B something doesn't mean you should, or that it makes it better.  However, most cruisers are vastly superior with A2B over the outdated and cheaper Dragon-style builds.  While I won't go as far as to say that a cruiser must be A2B, I'd highly suggest trying an escort-type ship if A2B isn't something you enjoy.• There are many A2B combinations you can use that are outside the box.  If something works for you, stick with it.  Just be sure that you try the more commonly used setups before you start claiming that your build is the second coming of sliced bread.

It has a 3 minute cooldown.  When you use it, your ship gains +7,000 stealth and is disabled and stopped for 5 seconds as you appear to explode.  The explosion will deal minor damage to anyone nearby.After 5 seconds, a purple lootbox appears that cannot be looted.  All of your abilities, weapons and shields remain disabled, but your engines come back online and gain +200% flight speed and turn rate.  You remain 'cloaked' by the +7,000 stealth bonus.The lootbox acts like a mine: if an enemy gets close to it, it will chase them.  Instead of detonating, it deals 600-1000 damage per second for 5 seconds and the target is held for the duration of the DoT; and all of your ability cooldowns are reset (both captain and boff abilities).If the lootbox mine doesn't hit a target, you remain stealthed with your weapons and shields offline for 25 seconds.  After that time, stealth fades and your systems and abilities come back online.  The lootbox remains, and will still chase any targets that come close, apply the DoT, and reset your cooldowns.

No one can see them!   For Theta Radiation and Warp Plasma,  this means that you can't avoid it,  and won't know you're in it until you can no longer turn or move, and notice the tiny debuff icon among the long list of other buffs and debuffs.Yellowstones add a perception debuff to their cloud that no one can see through.   But instead of knowing where a player will be around you by seeing the cloud,  you can't see the cloud, so they could be anywhere.   And since you don't know how close you are to the cloud,  you don't know how much of your perception is lost. The abilities themselves are fine, but without the ability to see them,  they're far more effective than they should be.   Avoiding them is supposed to be the counter,  but it's impossible to avoid what you can't see. * Ferengi D'Kora EMP consoleCryptic has known about this for forever, but won't seem to fix it.

What I want from Civ 6 (or a fix for Civ 5):* No-fail system so players can't join a game unless they meet the specified DLC requirements.* Regular patches following new DLC's (not expansions) that allow players to play a multiplayer game with people who have purchased additional civilizations while not having those civs themselves (the key being that they themselves can't choose those civs until they purchase them, but can still play against them without different versions of the game hindering setup).   Same for maps.  * An easier way to keep track of and manage DLC.I'm tired of being unable to join multiplayer games because I didn't pay $9 for two random new civs that I don't care about anyway.  I'm tired of waiting 20 minutes in the lobby while a game is being set up, to watch it collapse when 2 or more players don't have the DLC after all, and everyone abandons the game at the first sign of trouble.I'm just tired that it's so complicated and not-at-all user friendly.I can understand that they want to make more money with DLC, every game company does.

After doing a quick search, I discovered a class action lawsuit against Samsung for this very issue:  they'd used 10v capacitors in the television instead of the necessary 25v (a difference in pennies in cost for a very cheap part). Their goal was to get the TV to fail and need replacing after 8 years, but over 7 million units never made it past 3 years.I called up only to be told that the lawsuit had expired in February, and I was going to have to pay $500+ dollars to replace the $6 parts.  On the phone they were willing to admit the problem, but not that they were responsible.  They also seemed inclined to think that 6 years was more than I should have expected out of a $2000 television.All in all, it leaves a very bad taste in my mouth.

Take my advice with that in mind.Tom Brady:  Weeks ago, I tried to talk people off of the ledge by stressing that Brady's problems were the result of the O-line and would be fixed.   It's fixed,  and so long as it holds,  Brady is in beast mode.  He has the weekly ability to elevate his receivers to more than they'd normally be capable.  And the next 5 games are against Denver, Indy, Detroit, Green Bay, and San Diego; all teams who can score.   Brady will be throwing early and often, and should see plenty of TD's.    Fantasy playoffs will all be against division rivals Miami, New York, and Buffalo, in a time when the Pats typically establish their own playoff offense.  I'd start him every week possible from here to the end. Rob Gronkowski:  Brady's best weapon.   Huge.   Gronk make touchdown.   I personally wish he'd go down sooner on some plays,  just for the sake of his knees.   If he stays healthy,  he'll have huge games.  Must play every week. Tim Wright:  Fits great in the offense,  will poach some TD's and otherwise be mostly fantasy irrelevant.   Some weeks you won't know he's playing. Julian Edelman:  Dropped off the last few weeks,  but mainly to allow other weapons to develop.   With Gronk likely to be doubled and more attention being given to LaFell downfield,  expect Brady to start finding Edelman again.   I'd definitely start him next week against Denver.Brandon LaFell:  Brady had started to pass him some tricky throws that he's consistently caught.   He won't always have huge weeks,  but he'll see regular single coverage.   Brady will get him the ball.  With big passing games coming up, I think he'll be a solid WR2 in deep leagues. Shane Vareen:  Should have big games in the next 5 weeks as the Pats passing downs back.  No question RB2 until the playoffs,  could lose touches to Gray in fantasy playoffs against worse teams where the Pats run more  (Think Blount last year).Jonas Gray:  I don't expect consistent numbers from him in the next five weeks.   The Pats will have to pass,  and Vareen is their passing back.   However,  they want to run,  and if the defense holds he could have some bigger games.   I have higher hopes for him in the fantasy playoffs against bad teams.   Brady will run up the score early against them and Gray may resemble Blount in the last games of 2013.**TLDR Edit:  Shane Vereen.  Yes, I am embarrased.  Yes, it's okay for me to call myself a Pats fan and not know how to spell his name.  I don't know his number either.  For those of you who do, congrats, if there was a trophy for football fan'ing harder than me, you'd win it.  I can't spell Hooman's name either.  But I'll keep watching every game knowing it's okay that I don't have them memorized.**

39mij1	-59475	1434139299	wow	Your best days in World of Warcraft?	For me, it was easily The Burning Crusade.  I started WoW late into vanilla, so TBC offered me the first chance I had at "catching up" to the more established players.  Our guild was called "Slackers", they were social and friendly, but put together some really great runs.  I was a fire mage at the time when I joined, and my DPS was terrible, but I was improving.  Friday nights were for Karazhan runs to get geared up.  By the time we got to the Opera House, most of us had had enough to drink that we were slurring our words on Ventrillo.  But we'd run it so many times that it was easy by then.  Gruul was the first 25 man boss we ever beat, and it took us weeks to down him.  Magtheridon followed, and even he took nearly a month of attempts.  This may sound like we were terrible, but only two or three other guilds on the server had accomplished this, and this was before Blizzard started releasing "easy mode" content that you really can't lose at.  It was when I started putting my T5 set together that I switched to Arcane spec, and really shot to the top of the DPS charts.  Tempest Keep and Serpentshrine Cavern remain, to the day, the my favorite raids of all time.  Again, you couldn't move onto the next raids until you killed both Lady Vashj and Kael'thas, and both were insanely hard.  I think we went at each for almost three months before we started to defeat them regularly.  And beating them basically made you WoW royalty at the time.  Being able to say you were raiding Hyjal commanded respect.  I remember Archimonde taking us so long to beat that eventually, Blizzard unlocked the content so people who hadn't beaten Vashj/Kael'thas could attempt it.  By that time we had moved onto the Black Temple.  All in all, the best gaming in my life probably spanned a year.  Seeing the defeat of Illidan was our crowing achievement, and I remember the close bonds we all shared at the feat of just reaching that point.  We tried to replicate that feeling again in later expansions, but it was never quite the same.  I haven't played World of Warcraft in a few years now, but it is still the standard by which all other games need to compare for me (and I doubt another ever will).  So what was your best time in Warcraft?

u2oyk	-59483	1337864974	self	My friend just proposed and it was the most awkward thing I've seen in a while.	My roommate from my freshman year in school proposed to his girlfriend this past Tuesday.  He invited along a lot of our friends to witness this life changing event and I was happy to come and show my support.  My friend and his girlfriend have been going to a karaoke night at a local bar every Tuesday night for I don't know how long so that's where he decided to pop the question.  Now, it's not a really fancy bar, just a local college bar that draws customers in on Tuesday via karaoke, but it was special to them so it wasn't totally random.So many of our friends who don't normally hang out with them that often or go to said karaoke night, myself included, all show up around 10pm.  There are probably twice as many people as there normally are on a Tuesday night, but she oddly doesn't suspect anything.  I think my friend told her, "This is just the first night everyone has been free!" or something along those lines.  We ordered some beers and got excited for the show.Karaoke starts as normal with some interesting renditions of hit songs.  A few songs in and it's time for my friend to sing.  He enlists the help of some of his current roommates to provide background vocals so he can cut out during the song and propose.  Now, my friend ~~isn't the strongest singer~~ is a terrible singer.  He's much better at "singing" scream-o music as I suffered freshman year.  But he's giving it his best.About halfway through the song the DJ cuts the music and my friend goes over to his girlfriend who is sitting awkwardly in a chair right in front of the stage.  He basically had to force her into this chair before the song started so she knew something was up.  He leans over her and says something to her away from the karaoke mic so I can't hear it.  He then reaches into his pocket and pulls out a plastic bag, that's right a *plastic bag*, with her grandmother's ring in it and says in the mic, "Do you wanna get married?"  Thankfully she said "yes" and the bar erupted in cheers and applause.  The DJ gets on the mic and says, "that's the first proposal I've ever seen while doing karaoke!"  I don't doubt that it was.I wasn't the most romantic way to propose and it prompted one of my female friends to make a list of "proposals I will say no to" (e.g. at a bar, with the ring in a plastic bag) but all along it was what we were all expecting from my friend.  If you talk to him, he will say the night was perfect and everything was ideal.  It should be, he left that night engaged.

I don't have a huge collection of games, but in time that will change.I'm trying to find games that might interest my wife (so I have someone to play with on a regular basis) but also has a solitaire variant (so I can play by myself if she doesn't want to).Pandemic is definitely on the top of my list, but my wife is a HUGE fan of Lord of The Rings (a real fan... she reads through the books about twice a year). There's just one problem...From the videos I've seen there seem to be a large amount of cards involving spiders. Is this the case? This seems silly, but my wife suffers from some pretty extreme arachnophobia.I guess I could always put a sticker or something over those cards (as much as that would pain me to do). But I guess my question is, are there really that many? And, is it possible to pull those cards out? I know this would restrict certain things in the game.Thanks everybody!

uy68g	-59493	1339519831	tabletopgamedesign	First Game: Criticism and Game Name Wanted!	Hello, I hate reading super long posts so I'll try to make this as short as possible.This is a card game.Basic concept: The theme of the game is you are starting a band. Be the first player to complete 5 concerts to win.Each player is given 5 random concerts of increasing difficulty at the beginning of the game and they must complete them one at a time. Each concert has certain requirements to complete. Most of these requirements are based on the Talent Points of your band members and the Value Points of your Equipment and Hours of Practice.You deploy these cards from your hand to your band by purchasing them with fans (another type of card you will be drawing). That's right, every time you want to add (or remove) someone or something to your band you have to lose fans (think of it as "selling out").You can also sabotage other players with Girlfriend cards which provide some type of negative modifier. (Roadie cards provide positive modifiers to your own band)Also, after completing a concert you draw a fate card which (most likely) has a negative effect. Something like, "2 of your players had a fight after the concert. Choose one to leave the band (trash the card), and another to put back in your hand." This helps keep one person from shooting ahead of the other players.That's the basic concept. I haven't decided every mechanic yet, but that's my starting point.Below is a link to some Band Member card concepts. I'll be adding more to the album as I create them. Let me know what you think, and I'd also love suggestions for a name. "I'm With The Band" is the only thing I've come up with so far, but I'm not sold on that idea.http://imgur.com/a/sSZVZCheers!Edit: Also, at the beginning of the game you will choose a band name. Basically it'll be 2 random words put together, each one providing a different modifier. Think of it like choosing your class in Small World.Edit 2: Thanks for all of the suggestions everyone. Its definitely helping out a ton!

As with many Leapfrog products there is a boy version and a girl version.My wife noticed that the girl version was $22 while the boy version was $27. The only difference between the 2 products was the color of the device itself. Is that enough to justify a $7 difference?On Target's website the boy version is a little cheaper than it was in the store, but it's still more expensive than the girl version.  See below...[boy version](http://www.target.com/p/leapfrog-my-own-story-time-pad/-/A-13354416)[girl version](http://www.target.com/p/leapfrog-my-own-story-time-pad-pink/-/A-13597400)We went to customer service to see if they had an explanation but they were less than helpful, could care less about our problem and didn't offer to research the situation any further than saying, "I don't know why. That's just how they are priced."  When we asked why we were punished for having a boy he laughed and said, "You're not being punished."Are we crazy, or is that not wrong?

14gj1t	-59493	1354908858	Borderlands	Easy, stress free, somewhat-quick leveling tip for your almost level 50 character.	So, I finally got to level 50 yesterday. I, like many of you, tried very hard to only do the story missions so I could save the rest for playthrough 2.5. I found this to be increasingly frustrating the closer I got to level 50.At some point in logging in and out I accidentally logged into playthrough 1, but I didn't realize it at first. It wasn't until I looked at my mission log that I figured out what I had done. I forgot that I left so many side quests incomplete in playthrough 1!So, I decided to start going through them just for kicks. It was actually a lot of fun being able to blow through the missions like I had God mode on or something.Before I realized it I was done with 4 or 5 missions and my experience bar was REALLY close to 50! (3 of the quests were in Sawtooth Cauldron, so I completed them together very quickly)

2hhv70	-59493	1411702005	jailbreak	[Question] iPhone 4S unable to activate with Apple - Can jailbreak fix my woes?	Before I get started I want to clarify. This is the initial activation when you get your phone for the first time, or do a system restore. NOT the iCloud security activation lock.Back in June my iPhone 4S suddenly lost connection with Verizon's network. After going back and forth with Verizon support and Apple support they both shrugged their shoulders, unable to fix it. The only suggestion I was given was to restore my iPhone.So I restored.Then as I went through the initial activation of my "new" phone, it wasn't able to connect to the "activation servers". (not sure if that's the right term) I also tried activating it through iTunes but that didn't work either.So I talked to Verizon and Apple again, they still had no answer. I was left with a device that was capable of doing 1 thing, telling me "hello" in 30 different languages.Now I come to you fine experts of the jailbreak community. Is there any way for me to get past the activation? I would love to give this device to my son to use as an iPod.I have tried the stupid "call the emergency number 112 and then do A B C X Y X Y X Y ect..." but my phone does nothing when I dial 112.It is currently running iOS 7.1.1.One thing I thought might work was if there is a way to force an iPod Touch firmware onto it? That way it's the OS without the activation (I'm assuming).Thanks for your time reading this, and sharing your wisdom!

Which I just did. Whoops.Anyways, I recently started a Let's Play of Two Worlds. I bought the game on 360 years ago and hated it with a fervent passion. However, I read some amazing reviews online and found numerous people who defended the game. In disbelief, I decided to give it another chance and play the epic edition.Spoiler alert, I still hate the game and I talk all about why while making fun of the game in [my let's play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOyJ49LjYok&amp;list=PLr9fQQRIq-ibWJpAaxwwWVcVMQrHf0oT0).Hope you enjoy!
2tsyue	-59493	1422331588	letsplay	How to be more efficient with your effects processing in Audacity.	By now most of us are up to speed on why and how we should use Audacity. If you aren't one of those people,[ see this post before reading mine](http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/2tnmer/mic_recording_101_just_a_quick_guide_i_threw/).I'd like to show you all a neat little feature of Audacity that I've never seen mentioned here before. (My apologies if it has been mentioned) I started thinking it'd be nice if Audacity had a macro feature. A way to program a series of effects to process automatically. It does have this feature, and it's called a Chain.If you'd prefer a video, you can watch [this video I just posted](http://youtu.be/KLDBrAw8zq0). If you prefer reading, please continue.First you'll want to write down what all of your settings are for each effect. This is most likely not necessary, but it's good to be sure you know what they are.Click File then go down to Edit Chains.Click Add in the lower left corner of that window to create a new chain.Click Insert and find the first effect you would like processed. For me, that's Noise Removal. Find Noise Removal from the list and double click it, then click OK. Noise Removal is very unique compared to the other effects. We'll talk more about that in a little bit.Proceed inserting effects. My others include Compressor, Normalize, &amp; Bass and Treble. On these after you double click them you'll want to click on Edit Parameters. Verify the settings are what you want them to be (what you wrote down) and click OK. My tests have shown that they default to the most recently used settings.Finally, you'll want to insert ExportWAV. This will automatically export your new audio file after processing the effects.If you need to reorder the effects you can do so with the Move Up and Move Down buttons. Click OK when you're done setting up your chain.Now, open the audio file you need to process. If you used Noise Removal in your chain, select the area you would like the Noise Removal to use as the Noise Profile. Then click on Effects, Noise Removal, Get Noise Profile just like you would normally do. [According to the wiki](http://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/noise_removal.html) there is a faster way to do this, but it didn't work for me.After you've set the Noise Profile, click on File and then Apply Chain. Then select the chain you want to use and click Apply To Current Project. (You can also do it to a group of files, I haven't done that myself)Audacity will then proceed to perform all of the effects you would normally do and then save your new file in a folder called "clean" located where your original file is located. (Or it will tell you where it exported it if you recorded directly to Audacity)I hope this helps you save time as much as it has helped me! Here is a [link to the Chains page](http://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/edit_chains.html) of the wiki if you would like more info.
2wg0m0	-59493	1424364510	letsplay	I had a weird dream related to my channel last night...	Sorry for the random post, but I thought some of you might find it humorous, or perhaps you've experienced something similar and could share.I'm at work (tech/media guy at a church). Everyone seems to be acting a little odd, but it doesn't seem to be directed at me, I just assumed something was going on. It's not unusual for a recent event (death/sickness/family in need) to change the emotional dynamic in the office.Then I see some of the staff being pulled out of the office by police officers. My mind starts racing trying to figure out who did what to merit police officers here in the office interviewing the staff.Finally, it's my turn! The police officer and I begin walking the halls while he asks me generic questions, but they are all directed to me personally. After a few questions I ask the officer who the questions are in regards to."This is about you, Kyle." He said.I begin to panic trying to think of what I could have possibly done! "What is this in regards to?" I asked him."Kyle Blane Plays", He answered."What? Why would my YouTube Channel cause me to be in trouble with the police?" I asked."Someone was concerned with your emotional state. They're afraid you might be going crazy because you're pretending to be a different person." He answered."Who had this concern?" I asked."One of your own." He answered."A staff member?" I asked."No, a member of your family." He answered.I then proceed explaining that I refer to myself as "Kyle Blane" because that's been a joke for a long time. B is actually my middle initial, but people have pronounced "kyleblane" as "Kyle Blane" for years.In the midst of that conversation I woke up. I immediately knew what triggered the dream. Yesterday I received a notification that my brother subscribed to my channel. The secret is out! I guess I didn't realize how much it stressed me out.
2xe7q2	-59493	1425071667	letsplay	Apps/Services to help you be a better Twitterer	I've seen a lot of questions regarding Twitter lately. Is it necessary? Is it worthwhile for young channels? How should I use it? How can I stay consistent? What do I tweet about? I'm not here to answer those questions specifically, but I wanted to share with you the things I use to make Twitter easier and more effective.TLDR: Automated services are crap and don't build community. Use [Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com/) to schedule tweets for a specific time. Use [Tweetbot](http://tapbots.com/tweetbot/) for iOS. Use [Buffer](https://bufferapp.com/) to spread out your tweets. Use [Feedly](https://feedly.com/i/welcome) and [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/a/queue/) to find, read and share cool articles via Buffer.As for my background, social media has been a part of my day job for 4 years. I've studied it and tried a crap ton of different tools. These are what I've found to be the most useful.First, let's talk about something specific you should NOT do. Do not use any of these automation apps like [Unfollowers](https://unfollowers.com/) and [Twitfox](https://www.twitfox.com/). If you are interested in knowing who unfollows you, stop caring about that! The reason they stopped following you is because your tweets don't interest them. Let it go.People use these automation services to make running their Twitter account "easier" by automating tasks like automatically replying to new followers with a canned message or automatically favoriting tweets that meet a certain requirement. When you do this, it's for selfish, vain reasons. This doesn't truly build a relationship with others on Twitter.This idea of automation is against the very idea of Twitter. Twitter is about connecting with people you know and finding new people you don't know.So, what tools are good to use?[TweetBot](http://tapbots.com/tweetbot/) - This app has changed my use of Twitter more than any other. This iOS app is beautifully designed, amazingly responsive, and connects really well with other services. It's a joy to use. If you use lists (and you should) this makes viewing your lists a breeze as opposed to trying to view them on the official Twitter app. For years I refused to spend money on a Twitter app, but after purchasing both the iPhone and iPad versions, I could never use anything else.&gt; Sorry Android people, I'm not sure about the best app for you. I think Echofon is still around, it was good years ago when I used Android. I don't bother keeping up with that stuff because I'm never going back to Andoird. :P&gt; Lists are extremely useful if you are following a crap ton of people. Create a list for other LPers, Game Devs, Fans, etc...*[Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com/) - This is both a mobile app and a web app. I use it specifically for scheduling tweets to go out at a later time. This is great for scheduling a tweet to re-advertise a video you posted a few days ago. Don't overdo this though."But Kyle! That's automation!"No, scheduling an individual, customized tweet and automating canned messages are two different things.[Feedly](https://feedly.com/i/welcome) and [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/a/queue/) - These services work in tandem. Use Feedly to follow game blogs (or whatever news sites you want). You can read it there in Feedly OR you can decide to read it later by sending it to Pocket. These news apps give me another avenue to find things to tweet about.[Buffer](https://bufferapp.com/) - Buffer (like Hootsuite) is used to schedule tweets, but it does it a bit differently. With Buffer you setup a tweeting schedule (a repeating schedule of days/times you want tweets to go out). What this does is keeps you from tweeting out 20 things back to back and instead spaces them out. This not only makes it look like you are more consistent and present on Twitter, it keeps you from annoying people who don't want to see a wall of your tweets in their feed. Like /u/dillwillhill [did last night on accident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDUM_8obq08).edit: Just to clarify, I thought DillWillHill's accident was hilarious. I'm not calling him out or upset about it.Buffer is great for non-time-sensitive tweets. Buffer also connects with other services, allowing you to do some cool things.**So, let's connect the dots. This is where it gets fun.*** If I find a tweet that I really like and want to retweet it, but I've already tweeted 2 other things in the last 5 minutes and would rather this retweet go out later, I can send the tweet to Buffer directly from Tweetbot and it will then be added to next available time slot in Buffer.* If I'm browsing Feedly or Pocket and want to share an article I just read, I send it to Buffer and it fills the next time slot.* If I come across a tweet with a link to an article that I want to read later, I can send it from Tweetbot to Pocket. The cool thing about this is it's smart enough to send the link of the article, not the link of the tweet itself. Then after reading the article I send it to Buffer (if I want to share it).All of this connectivity is built into the apps. Once you make the connection on each app, it's a breeze to share from one to the other.As you can see, my secret to using Twitter is to not use Twitter! Make use of other apps that all work together! I hope you all enjoyed this and learned something new! Also, feel free to[ follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/kyleblaneplays), if you want.

I researched it but didn't find anything strongly opposing it for this subreddit. Please downvote me into the Mantis Homeworld if this isn't okay. This will be the only time I post about this LP on this subreddit either way.*Hello fine educated people of r/ftlgame.Let me start by saying thank you to everyone who has posted advice/guides here because it has helped me tremendously.

I've also discovered how much I didn't know about the game when I first played it.With that new enthusiasm for for the game I started a new weekly Let's Play of FTL. How I'm doing it is I start every run on Sunday and do a sector every day throughout the week until I die, ending on Saturday if I make it to the flagship.

Every now and then I'll see a video where a big LPer has their phone alarm go off in the middle of recording and they pause for a moment to publish a video. (I've specifically seen this with BDubs a number of times.)I've been trying to figure out why he doesn't just schedule his videos, but then it hit me. When scheduling you are only given the option to do it on the hour and half-hour. By manually scheduling you are able to remove yourself from the burst of videos being published automatically on the hour and half-hour, making your video more visible.I'm not crazy right? That's a brilliant idea.

I feel that i cant talk to my friends a lot of the time recently and looking through Reddit i cant seem to find a subreddit where I could go and just talk about how I am feeling and have people not judge me for it. This may not work, I may have nobody here but I thought that if someone like me was looking for somewhere to talk they could find that here. People tend not to understand me when I try and talk to them. They take one look at me and assume that I am some unfeeling dick because of how I look.

pcmvb	-59506	1328497169	sad	Today i realized that i prefer being sad over being happy.	Its been a bad month for me for so many reasons, but today everything just came down on me at once. But as i was crying i realized that while i may be sad i feel somehow comfortable. I started to thing about that and came to the conclusion that when i'm sad there is little chance that ill feel worse, but when i'm happy i'm always expecting it to end. Expecting something to happen to take it all away again. So I think to myself, why bother trying to find happiness again when chances are i'm just going to lose it. I feel like i'm not making myself clear about how i feel but i just need to put this down somewhere.

h7gen	-59509	1304961506	AskReddit	Carpenter Bees - Should a fuck be given?	Basically I have to get up on a ladder in close proximity to where these big ass bees are nesting and there's a LOT of them flying around. When I say a lot, I mean a fuck load. And if you aren't familiar with them, they're like the size of your thumb flying around. Like small humming birds.Does anyone have experience with these things? Sources say that they don't sting but I don't want to find out the hard way 25 feet off the ground. They're very curious by nature and they come right up to me on the ground checking me out and such. Souces say they aggressively defend the nesting area, but it's all for show (fo sho). It will be like 100 times as many buzzing my head on that ladder. Should I give a fuck? Or are these bee/birds going to bite the shit out of me up there. Either way, I'll get it on my GoPro camera so my family will have something to remember me by on what could be my last say on earth.
hbsng	-59509	1305459332	motorcycles	My recent biker cop experience.	I was actually trying to take a night picture for this Month's motohunt contest.I rode into the city (New London, CT) and I thought the public library would be nice. Within seconds of me getting my bike on the sidewalk, a motorcycle cop pulls up next to me. He says "you all set buddy?" and I immediately recognize him as the ONE guy that I know on the force. We actually went fishing last year. So I take off my helmet an we talk a little bit, I explain that I was just trying to take a picture. He says "you can take a picture of whatever you want" and rides off. I rode around some more feeling like a VIP. Oh, and I never did get a decent picture.

injza	-59509	1310489582	motorcycles	Just some tips for new riders, from me to you.	I see a LOT of new rider posts. Here's just a few bits of advice that you probably won't learn in the safety course.**Stop signs:** When you get to a stop sign, make sure to put your left foot on the ground. Bikers have a tendency to roll through stop signs. It'll force you to come to a complete stop, or damn near to it. If police witness you putting your foot down, they're likely to overlook the fact you didn't come to a **complete** stop.**Stop Lights:** *edit* Apparently, leaving it in gear is considered to be safer. Just make sure the oncoming traffic STOPS before you enter the intersection.**Watch your toes:** Your feet are generally most comfortable resting with the peg in the middle of your foot. This can cause your toes to stick out too far, making turns dangerous. You can feel free to relax in the straight sections however you want, but in turns, make SURE to pull your feet back so only your toes are on the pegs. If your toes stick out too far, and they hit the ground during a turn, you could easily break your foot. It's quite dangerous.**Careful with that downshift:** As you slow down to make a turn, you will also be downshifting. Be careful not to downshift too early or it can cause the rear wheel to lock up and slide out to the side. This is ESPECIALLY dangerous if the roads are wet. Easy does it on that downshifting, you're not in a race.** SLIPPERY WHEN WET ** You've probably heard this before, but it can't be overstated. Rain makes everything (except bare asphalt) extremely slippery. When it's wet, watch out for everything especially steel covers (manhole or otherwise), paint, leaves...anything. Don't trust ANY of it.Good luck out there guys.

kb2a6	-59509	1315655280	trees	Interesting TOOL fact - involves levitation. 	I heard an interesting story (from a radio DJ) about one of the guys from Tool.Apparently, he was detained as he was traveling through an airport in Florida. He was carrying about $10,000 in cash. His reasoning? He told security that he was on his way to purchase a hand written book containing the secrets of levitation. The guy who wrote the book was the same guy that built the [Coral Castle](http://coralcastle.com/).The Coral Castle was build by a small frame guy, in secrecy, all by himself. The stones were massive and he did it all by himself. There's more to the story but that's the main part.As I remember security did NOT believe him and they held him for a while until they were satisfied he wasn't lieing to them. I don't know if he ever did get to buy the book.Tool is an amazing band. I got their first album, Undertow, when it came out a long time ago and I still like their music more than most other stuff. I had the chance to see them live and it magnified my respect for them by ten fold, at least.

One of the basic ingredients that everyone (including myself) usually misses is acid. No, not the kind that make you trip balls for six hours - the kind from lemons or limes. In basic cocktail chemistry, you have 3 ingredients. Some booze, something acidic and something sweet. Keeping these three things in proportion is the key to making a pro drink.TL;DR If it tastes a bit sweet for you, add lemon or lime juice.LAST TIP, coffee filter suck. They clog far too easily. Use a clean cloth like an old T-shirt. Just make sure it's clean. Cheers motherfuckers.

lhpif	-59509	1319046669	motorcycles	I repair riding gear. The usual fixes I do are burn holes in nylon pants or broken zippers. If you could use some work done, read on.	I use industrial machines that can easily sew through many layers including leather. I can make sleeves and pant legs longer or shorter, add buckles, re-do velcro, you name it.Most of the repairs will only run $20-$30 plus the shipping costs.  I have black leather and heavy duty waterproof nylon on hand at all times. I have a page over on ADVrider, so check it out and if you would like something fixed up or altered, send me a message either here or on ADVrider.Here's some examples of things I've worked on.http://advrider.com/forums/showthread.php?t=624706EDIT:  You all can reach me at the email below if you like, and we can take the details offline.dirtbikezero@gmail.comEDIT2 Including some pictures.Pants seat repair  http://i.imgur.com/RREpf.jpgSome buckles I made http://i.imgur.com/zrj4p.jpgA bag I make http://i.imgur.com/xgHFj.jpgI won't be posting any more ads Keep me in mind if you would like some work done.I'm a MOD over in /r/Motohunt too.

ljg8a	-59509	1319163401	motorcycles	I almost hit a deer tonight. Many fucks were given.	I was the only vehicle on a dark highway. 2 lanes each direction. No lights. I was going 70 in a 65, in the right lane, paying attention and alert. I saw something in the left lane and I moved to right a little. It was a big scared deer about 4 feet to my left. There was no time to react - anything could have happened. Lesson: When riding at night in deer country, follow a cager or slow way down.

I've been asking people to get pictures of their bikes for the challenges, but interest seems to be tapering. If you had something else in mind, please share your idea and opinions. If nothing else, try to get out there and get a picture of your bike in a setting that is only around once a year. Good luck guys. Winning picture goes on the sidebar.

I will personally be preparing a GeoCache box for the Northeast USA region. The rules are [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p4HlOeFfdoZ84ZD_2e_5BdAfIi5q5iZ6MwgeNSmYYe4/edit) and will be put on the sidebar ASAP. It may move slow at first, but I think we can drive up subscribers with some fresh contests.Second new feature. By the new year, I'd like to start an annual achievement contest. Basically there will be roughly 20 achievements to do and as you complete them, your name will go on the sidebar with a small icon or "badge" next to your name representing the completion of each one. You'll be able to see how far along everyone is. This will take some work to complete in 4 weeks, but I think I'll be worth it.Last, the monthly picture challenge will remain the same, except for how the winner will be determined. At the end of the month, I will cross promote the entries in /r/motorcycles and the one with the most upvotes will win. This gives everyone equal chance to win, with the added bonus of making our subReddit more visible.What can you do?  Please respond to this with some achievement ideas that you think would be appropriate. For example, a picture at least 150mi(240km) away from your house. You get the idea. Once I get an acceptable list, I'll work on the icons/badges.EDIT:  I'm suspending the annual achievement contest due to the fact that I have NO idea how to make this work. It seems that putting little icons on the sidebar is impossible. ASCII only.As far as the Geocache thing goes - IT'S ON

If you have neither, I'll accept something else interesting in your life, and personal to you, posed with your bike. Good luck.The submissions for the previous challenge have been posted for vote over in /r/motorcycles. 
o04i5	-59509	1325535316	AskReddit	Domino's Pizza Delivery People - Does the company pay for part of  your car insurance?	I've always noticed that none of the Dominos Pizza places have company cars - they make you use  your own. My question is - How to they compensate you for this?If you tell your car insurance company, as you should, that you are using your car for delivering pizzas 8 hours a day, your rates are certainly going to be much higher. I personally wouldn't risk using the car for something it wasn't insured for and have my insurance claim denied.  Does Domino's offer to pay for the difference in insurance premiums - or do they expect you to lie to your insurance company?If they pay you per mile, that generally is intended to cover fuel and "wear and tear" (maintenance) costs only. With the purchasing power of a large corporation, they could buy cars at a much lower cost that the general public can. I can only believe that the only reason to make people use their own cars is for insurance (fraud) reasons.

Ok, firstly, announcement number A, I'd like to congratulate user "omrl" for having the winning picture this month.  It WAS a nice picture.  Bravo, well done. The flames are awesome.Secondly, there was an issue this month with the postings.  As you may (or more likely, may NOT) have noticed, the submissions didn't get very many votes.  This was due to some of the members of /r/motorcycles reporting my posts as spam or downvoting them.  There's no need to be bitter about it, with that many members, there's bound to be a few curmudgeons.  Whatever.  That brings me to point number C.New changes - From now on, I will be posting all the individual threads HERE in /r/motohunt for people to vote on. I will then make ONE post in /r/motorcycles with links pointing to our individual threads.  Now, I won't be getting any link karma anymore, but it has to be done.  (The whole link karma jealousy thing is really unbelievable) Hopefully, this will prevent our pictures from ending up in the spam filter or downvoted into oblivion. Thanks to everyone for participating, keep up the fine work. Yours truly,DBZ

I've seen some suggest custom made ones from an ear doctor.  I'd rather try to find some cheap semi-disposable ones if possible.Foam is too awkward to roll up and stick in before it expands and doesn't fit well. Also, they like to come loose as you put your helmet on and you need to repeat the whole process. Far from ideal.Thanks in advance.

rpjcr	-59509	1333377261	motohunt	Motohunt April Challenge - FULL MOON	April is the month of Easter, or Resurrection Day (Christians) - celebrated the First Sunday after the first full moon on or after March 21st (between March 22 and April 25).Your challenge is to photograph your bike under the full moon (APRIL 6th) - or as close to "full" as possible. Honestly, all that is required is a moon in the picture. So, on a nice night when you're otherwise doing nothing, take the bike for a ride and try a little photo shoot. Low-light photography is especially tricky so this will be a good chance for you to play around with the settings on your camera that you don't usually use.Enter the challenge by responding here with a link to your picture. Good luck to everyone.DBZ

What I'm thinking is going into X type of store, and spending X amount of money on items. Store type and spending amount can be negotiated.Then we agree to send each other packages containing roughly equal value "stuff".  Anyone SERIOUSLY interested in this let me know. It will require a bit of faith at first and be willing to spend an equal amount of money.Again, I'm in the USA and am interested in trading with people overseas. Please respond with your country and feel free to form agreements for trade with whoever you choose to. Comments/criticism is also welcome.

td7c3	-59509	1336497857	LifeProTips	LPT: Lawnmower Edition, Turn that bogged down POS into an unstoppable grass devouring animal.	There are two things that effect the mower's capacity to blast through thick grass: blade speed and discharge rate. Most lawnmowers sold today have one speed. It's either on, or it's off.  I'll explain how to change that. Also, all that grass needs somewhere to go, I'll address that too1) As said, most mowers don't come with a throttle control - BUT, if you bend down and take a look at the carburetor, you'll almost certainly find a plate on the top or side of it.  Give it a twist and you should find that it will cause the engine speed to greatly increase.  Go ahead, try it, you won't hurt anything.  Once you've identified this valve, you'll need to lock it in a more open position. I use a combination of wire and duct tape to do the job.If you have a mulching mower, with no side discharge, that's all you can do.  Part 2 won't apply.2) Get that grass out of your mower. We all know the problem - longer grass tends to clump up and clog the mower causing it to make your yard look terrible and stall the mower.  What you need to do is remove that plastic discharge chute completely. What you want is a big gaping hole in the side of your mower deck.  If you mow like this, you'll find that the grass will now shoot out like crazy but it's dangerous and it'll blow all over you, so we aren't done yet.  What you'll need to do is make a new larger chute out of thin wood, cardboard or whatever you have laying around. Use liberal amounts of duct tape to hold everything together.  What you are aiming to do is form a new larger chute that won't impede the flow of grass from exiting the mower deck, and at the same time, protect you from getting hit with anything coming out of the mower.  You want it to spray as far as possible.  It takes a bit of trial and error but with enough duct tape anything is possible.When you're done, you'll be mowing down the tallest grass without leaving any unsightly lawn killing clumps of cut grass behind. It's a thing of beauty.  Tonight, I'll try to take a few pictures of my mower describing the process. My standard lawnmower now shoots grass a solid 6 to 10 feet.EDIT:  If you are currently happy with the way your mower works, don't alter it.  This was meant to be a PRO TIP for people that are frustrated with the mower stalling and the grass clumping.

Read the Geocache rules on the sidebar for what should be included in each one.  It doesn't have to be expensive at all.  It doesn't even have to contain any items for trade if you don't want to include them.  It's all about the hunt, not the prize.

xungh	-59509	1344382777	Dualsport	Tips for caring for your dualsport forks, and more.  What I personally have found to be the best. Not a karma post. AMA	Forks need maintenance. First, UPSIDE DOWN FORKS, yea they're great BUT when your bike gets dried mud on it, it is very important to clean the bottom of the fork tubes. Otherwise, the next time you ride it, dirt get jammed into your seals. Use a spray lubricant and wipe clean.Fork oil DOES need to be changed. Don't panic, you can do it. Refer to you manual for the intervals, but it does get dirty fast. I try to do it (dirtbike) every 50 hours (twice the recommended limit). One change per year is a decent guide to go by if nothing else. The primary source of contamination in your fork oil is from the shaft pushing dirt past the seals.  When/if your seals start to leak, they should be replaced.  So, remember ... changing oil and cleaning the tubes is easy, replacing seals is hard.Oil, change it often if you like your bike. Keep it nice. The particular brand is inconsequential compared to the frequency of your changes.  Any oil without friction modifiers will be fine.  (I use Mobil1)Chain.  Lube it often.  Once every tank or so. 500miles. You don't have to clean it every time.  Just add more oil/lube.  I LOVE this stuff. It's thin and wicks into all the links, not waxy - more of a sticky film.  Found everywhere. http://liquidwrench.com/pressroom/releases/pressreleases_detail.asp?r=1When it comes time to clean your chain, Kerosine and WD40 make good cleaners but they aren't lubricants. So clean with them then lube afterwards.  Have a garden hose ready. Put Kerosine (cheaper and just as good) in a spray bottle. Use a stiff plastic bristle brush and the Kerosine all over then hose off right away. Re-lube the chain.Clean your air filter.  If it dries out and lets dust by, you're done. Engine rebuild time. Well, that's the major stuff.  Expect to replace your share of wheel bearings too. It's all part of it.  Hope it helps a few people.Of course, feel free to AMA.  I'll do my best.In parting, a recent picture of the big bike.http://i.imgur.com/tj34Z.jpg

If someone runs with it, I'd be happy to mod what I can, which wouldn't be much.  I have no idea on a name either.  /r/gamereviews exists.

1o14tp	-59509	1381283544	capokerclub	Thanks, whoever you are.	I was in a game one night and one of you fucks mentioned the band The Pretty Reckless.  So I checked them out on YouTube and they fucking rock.  I've since put their album onto the regular rotation short list and liking it.  Anyway, I just got curious about a tour and looked them up. Sure enough, they're on tour and I got a few tickets.  Ill be at the final show of the stretch at the Paradise Rock Club in Boston, 11/11.  I think it was Vodka or Hate, but thanks whoever mentioned then in a game.P.S. I recently got into Volbeat too.  Watch "Still Counting" on YouTube.

1oxqdc	-59509	1382396245	RideitRelay	RIDEITRELAY update... I'm on this bitch....	So I read all the posts, articulate and profane alike, and I've come to a decision.  I wont be disclosing what I came up with until I'm done, but I can say that it will be a doll worthy of a true man to carry. Tomorrow I will pick up some supplies and start putting my tools to use.  My main point for posting is simply to let you guys know that my commitment level has not diminished.  On the contrary actually, the more I think about doing it, the more I want to see how it finally comes out.Please stay patient for a week or so while I bust this bitch out.DBZ

1p8725	-59509	1382744298	RideitRelay	MOTOSNOO update....	This weekend is it.  A new mascot shall emerge.  I have all the materials I need now and I finished the design.  It came out great but I don't want to spoil the surprise.  All I can say is that the group's patience will be rewarded.  I literally just gathered the last of the materials to give it the finishing touches I was shooting for.  I can say a couple things about the design without giving it all away.  It will have a zipper and serve as a bag to hold small stickers and trinkets.  It will have some attachment points in case someone wants to lash it to the bars or whatever.  It will be made from white vinyl so it can be easily cleaned. And the eyes might be my favorite part, they will glow orange in true alien fashion. My goal is to post a photo of the finished mascot on Sunday and open a thread up to plan the hand-off.  Prepare your grubby little hands, I will be setting loose a mascot that I (we) can be proud of.

Note: this is a 40oz Bud  http://i.imgur.com/c20JSiE.jpgEach one is done by hand, no computer embroidery work.  They'll all be unique.The liner is a 3mm foam laminated taffeta and the outer is a 1000 denier ballistic nylon cordura, and a CA logo.Unfortunately, I do not have a large amount of disposable income.  I am doing ok but breaking about even on my sewing ventures, so I'll just ask for a small donation in exchange.   I'll make a solemn promise to the sub to make one for every person that donates.  Throw me a few clams and tell me what you want.  It's about that simple.My paypal ID is the same as my bag business, sales@blackibags.comPlease send donations as a gift, give me your address in comments, and give me some time to get this done.  I have nothing prepped but I'll start tonight.Merry CAmas everyone.Edit: I don't post much in the main forum here, but I'm sure a few of the guys from the CA Poker Club can vouch for me.  I'm a regular there.  My resolution this year will be to share more with the sub here.  Edit 2: A few people have asked how much to donate.  Well, If I list an amount, it won't be a donation.  No donations will be turned down.  My only real goal is to break even on the shipping. Also, a few people have asked for 16oz coozies.  Unfortunately, I'm not doing those right now, maybe some other time.  Sorry, but I'm trying to keep it manageable.

Yea, so I got a few bucks from work for not getting fired or quitting.  Perfect.  Here's what I picked up.   http://i.imgur.com/8w4r200.jpg?1The vodkas are from Lithuania.  The bison grass one is awesome, I know that.  Had it before.  The grassy after taste is strangely enjoyable.  Hard to explain why it's good, I suppose it's because it leaves you with something enjoyable, but not sweet.I've been meaning to try the Rye one, and I just did.  It is NOT sweet, which is good.  I wasn't going for sweet.  It has the familiar strong bite of vodka, with subtle grain after taste.  Very, very subtle.  It's good.I haven't tried the whiskey yet, but I like Canadian and Irish whiskey, so I took a chance on something I'd never normally try, but looks good.  How could it not be.Here's to booze that you can just pour and drink - and isn't sweet like syrup.  Fuck all that whipped cream, fruit loop, appletini bullshit.  Cheers.

2rj4a7	-59509	1420564911	LifeProTips	LPT - How to prevent rust from spreading on you car, or anything.	In short - apply grease to it.  It'll stop it from rusting for 1 to 2 years.-Details -  If you have rust spots on you vehicle, and you just want to stop them from getting worse (aren't concerned with fixing it cosmetically), read on.  You will need to get some axle grease or moly lube. This stuff is cheap.  It's around $4 for a small tub or tube, give or take.  The specific kind is not important.  The consistency is thick and sticky.To this to work, you need to remove any loose paint and rust.  The easiest way is to simply scrape it off using a flat head screwdriver or similar. Scrape well where the paint meets the rust spot. Get ALL the loose stuff scraped off you can. Then simply wipe grease onto the spot. I just use my finger, latex gloves are nice to keep fingers clean.The result will be a dark spot, but it wont rust for 1 to 2 years.- If you have a large area to do, you can mix used motor oil and moly lube roughly 50/50 then brush it on.  Again, just scrape the loose stuff off first.  You can do the under side of you car this way, but I highly recommend going to a shop and paying to have it undercoated if you car is 10 years old.  If you dont, it wont last another 5 years in Northern climates.

32r1js	-59509	1429145406	Dualsport	Please allow me to introduce myself and my services.	Dirt_Bike_Zero is the name, DBZ for short.  I'm posting to offer the members of the forum, or anyone, my sewing services.  I'm a MOD here, but I'm not looking for special consideration.  I'm just a guy like you all.  I like to ride, and I like it dirty.  By day, I am a mechanical designer and a textile draftsman.  I have access to a lot of sewing machines, materials and support.  My side job is making custom bags and doing garment repairs.   For you, I can add patches to ripped or shredded fabric, replace zippers of ALL kinds, install snaps, buckles, velcro, or whatever.  This is an example of a pocket zipper that I just did.  Pocket zippers are a pain in the ass , and this one came out great.  http://i.imgur.com/AzBgBuL.jpgHow much? My rates are REALLY cheap.  I generally can do any standard patch or zipper in about an hour, so like $20.  Maybe up to $30 for a zipper.  I never gouge my customers.  They often pay more for shipping than the actual repair.  The vast majority of my work comes from the ADVrider forum.  My handle there is "akarob", look me up if you like.  Anyway, I won't post a bunch of pictures because it's all on my website.  Check out the "about" section in particular.  www.blackibags.com  is me.  Sole proprietor. So if you think I can be of service by mending a garment so you can avoid replacing it, let me know.  Did I mention I make bags?  :-)I'm happy to answer questions if you want to post them, or contact me directly to discuss your particular needs.  Thanks.DBZ

350hu0	-59509	1430878293	cripplingalcoholism	Feeling like I'm maintaining, but for how long?	I started to do a long write up of my situation.  It's fucking pathetic.  You guys are SO much beyond what I deal with. I enjoy hearing about your bouts with benzos and withdrawl symptoms. It scares the fuck outa me.  Thanks, for sharing, so us less than full-blowns can postpone the inevitable as long as possible. I tip my freebie glass from a local vinyard full of boxed wine (on top of a bit of 90 proof whiskey) to you.  Positive shit:  DBZ wife is actually being really cool lately and things are smooth there.  Job is cool, but in a lull.  I'm still sewing all types of stuff on the side, my real interest.  I made a really fucking cool fishing pole bag.  Here are a few pics.  I ride dirt bikes, I fish and I sew - heavy duty.  This is the bag, fishing pole inside, with tackle boxes on each side.  Don't pay too much attention to the colors/pattern, it can easily change.  It's the overall design that works.http://i.imgur.com/NHoA74a.jpg?1This is the pole and tackle boxes removed.http://i.imgur.com/ffdFxVa.jpg?1The next two are of what's in the small tackle boxes.http://i.imgur.com/b9TjZEF.jpg?1http://i.imgur.com/YX0i3B6.jpg?1If any of you guys want a fishing setup like this, hit me up PM.  I have a website, but it's not listed as something I offer yet.  Too new.   Thanks for reading my vent.

35l0m6	-59509	1431341382	Connecticut	Illegal ATV / dirtbike use , the State's solution is to fine the gas stations?	Here's a thought, why can't the police simply enforce the laws that are currently in place?  You know, it's expensive to pass new laws.  All the lawyers that need to write them, etc etc.  All a waste if they're not enforced.Anyway, my REAL question is what is stopping the police from actually doing something about it?  No chase policy?  I'd be fine with that if they used some other means of stopping them, like a net gun.  Am I really way out of line to think the criminals could be easily stopped using a net gun?It just seems that the police should be able to get this in check using the existing laws and tools at their disposal.

Stuff happens and contacts fall though sometimes.  I think it would be better than having it disappear because you can't make a connection in person.

17h0b3	-59536	1359428116	subaru	First car? Should I buy a Crosstrek?	First off, I appreciate any help. Thank you.I am about to buy a crosstrek but am a little lost after all my research. Everything says it is a pretty solid car, but the engine needs to be a little stronger to be a great car. And that is a little alarming to me.Currently I am driving a 2005 Toyota Matrix XR, which isn't going to win many races but will get up to speed in a hurry. I have tried to get a test drive but the scarcity of them is making it very hard. I am also torn because I have access to the VIP pricing program, but of course, the crosstrek is excluded (damn you murphy).So:1) Car guru's, how would you compare the crosstrek to an 05 matrix? for reference it has 130 hp and a curb weight of about 2700 lbs http://www.edmunds.com/toyota/matrix/2005/features-specs.html?style=&amp;sub= 2) In your opinion is the crosstrek a good subaru? I could get an impreza sport for considerably less on the VIP program, but I do like the clearance the crosstrek provides. And I think its a good looking subie.3) That being said, should a 2013 forester be in the cards? I steered away due to it not being updated lately. But i want to explore all avenues.Thank you for the time, and words of wisdom. I want the crosstrek, but I am a first time car buyer, and terrified of making the wrong decision.Someday, I hope to contribute here....

Both units are owned by two different landlords and are rented out. I live on the bottom unit. The above tenants' water heater broke and the water leaked into my ceiling, leaving my place in a construction zone. Mind you, my place is a 1 bed 1 bath and the construction area is pretty central to my living space. I am staying with a friend until my place is back to normal. We caught it in time, and moved my stuff out of the way. None of my personal belongings were destroyed.The HOA Vice President confirmed that this situation and insurance issue is between landlord and landlord.  However to seek reimbursement for my extra commute, additional food expenses and reimbursement for my rent for the month of February, my landlord wants me to make a claim through my renters insurance company and claim from the above landlord's insurance.My understanding is that this is supposed to be landlord to landlord, so is this normal?  None of my personal belongings were destroyed, so I'm just seeking reimbursement for my rent and added expenses.I have informed my landlord that I would prefer not making a claim (to avoid the negative impact of my insurance rate) and would be happy with her foregoing my march rent to take care of the days I haven't stayed there and the extra expenses incurred from not being able to live there.Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I am getting a lot of conflicting instructions from a lot of parties, who I think are just protecting their insurance rates. I just don't want to get screwed.Edit: format/a word

I know it's really cool to be able to cook eggs in cast iron and have them not stick.... But Teflon is not a shitty product. I know it wears and flakes; but high quality pans with Teflon are worthy advancement in cooking technology. We don't have to go out of our way to make people feel bad about Teflon. It is really condescending and probable makes it intimidating for new cast iron users who come here. Show us your steaks or your potatoes, your roasted veggies and clean seasoning.

But at the same time, washing a hot pan is heavily discouraged since it could create too much thermal irregularity in the pan. What's the difference? Is there some magic about still being on the heat vs in the sync?

26ebr3	-59546	1400962208	CodeGeass	Theory about the end of R2	I see a lot of love for an alive Lelouch around but here's my theory as to how he's really dead.So, we know that a high level Geass user can kill someone who has a Code. Specifically, they need to have Geass in both eyes. Keep this ind mind.Secondly, we know that Nunnally could see Lelouch's memories when he slid down to her. This is a popular reason for people to theorize that Lelouch, who must have the Code, cannot die.Lastly, when Lelouch and Suzaku plan Zero Requiem, Lelouch explains to Suzaku that Geass is like "a people's wish." He says that he is giving that Geass to Suzaku. Suzaku says that he will "accept that Geass." Keying together all of that, I say that Suzaku, using the power of his Geass'd mind ("to survive") and the "Geass" of the people's wishes, killed Lelouch, who had the Code, but gave Suzaku the "Geass" of the people's wishes. The part about the two eyes? When Bismark and Suzaku fight and Suzaku has to use his "to survive" command to win, it highlights both of his eyes. Suzaku is, in theory, a high level Geass user.

28eco4	-59546	1403035820	whowouldwin	Who is the weakest character that could solo the horde of demons from Zzyzx (Fablehaven)?	**Mild spoiler alert for the Fablehaven series**, although the last book was published a few years back so I'm not going to spoiler tag the entire thing as that's annoying to read.[Small article on Zzyzx, though it does not have much info.](http://fablehaven.wikia.com/wiki/Zzyzx)Some of the more powerful demons were strong enough to solo armies (think old fashioned armies using spears and shit, not ones with nukes) including the Demon King and several of his sons as well as others. One demon was basically a frog that would eat anything until it got strong enough to eat whatever first activated it (it will freeze and do nothing, someone has to feed it to activate it again). Another was strong enough to wipe out a fairly large army of protagonists via disease which had to be stopped by one of the strongest protagonists (a unicorn, unicorns have magic and are in general bad-ass in the series).The size of demons isn't exactly known, but it took over three hours for all of them to get out, and they weren't exactly slow. The total number is easily in the thousands.Obviously a planet buster could solo, but who is the weakest who could?
29nx92	-59546	1404320867	whowouldwin	How long would it take Santa to kill off the human species with a Death Note?	Let's say he has an infinite life span for both rounds. He can watch any children ages 16 and below, so he cannot directly kill anyone 17 or above. He has the ability to already know any child's name so let's say he has no Shinigami eyes, meaning he does not know their natural life span. Round 1: Directly killing every child 16 and below until the Human race is extinct.Round 2: Killing particular children in order to cause adult deaths and more children deaths until they are extinct. 
2amcht	-59546	1405293948	whowouldwin	Who is the strongest character Tom Ward (The Last Apprentice) could beat?	The series is called 'The Last Apprentice' in the U.S., 'The Spook's Apprentice' in the U.K., and is also known as 'The Wardstone Chronicles'. Just needed to clear that up.I'm guessing nobody here really knows his current feats (book 13 spoilers, clear away if you're in the middle of the series.) so I'll go ahead and list his average attack power:- The equipment we'll give him (besides something he could grab with prep-time) is his star-blade, given to him by a Witch Assassin. It negates spells up to a certain strength, even though Tom already had a natural resistance. He also has his staff, probably his best weapon, made of wood with a switch-blade at the end of it that he can pull out or leave in. He also has the three Hero Swords, made for killing the (previously) strongest entity in the universe. See below as to what that was about. The last of his weapons is his silver chain, able to bind many enemies of the "dark." He doesn't have any armor, he wears a black cloak that doesn't seem to inhibit his movement.- His speed is pretty much average, as his his strength. Not even peak-human of his universe strength-wise, and even that is pretty low. However, he does have the ability to slow down or stop time. This ability is pretty iffy in the fact that the only times he uses it are against gods. Who generally have the same ability. No pre-cog, however he can sense enemies' locations and generally where he should be headed for whatever reason. Don't think this matters, but he also has a very keen sense of time. For in-character fights, he is generally pretty smart strategy-wise. Only one time has he really lost his cool, and even then he did pretty well in battle.- Finally, his feats. Firstly: a wizard in the series with god-like powers was unable to harm Tom with magic, and lost in a sword fight. He also was stated to be able to defeat one of the strongest witches in the series, who was earlier able to take town an entire ship full of average witches and ab-humans, who are basically stronger than peak humans of various sizes and powers.  - Secondly: He took the three Hero Swords mentioned above and more or less killed the Fiend, the main antagonist of the series. He was severely weakened, I will mention. He did earlier in the series with the help of a witch assassin and his master bind a full strength Fiend and cut his head off.   - Lastly (that I'll mention for now): He fought a war god, lost, but won anyways. The god was the Fiend's right-hand man who was resurrected to help resurrect the Fiend himself. He lost the initial fight, but his mother was basically a god herself, being the first Lamia, and her blood poisoned the god when he tried to eat Tom. This god, by the way, was so goddamn metal his dimension (each of the gods have their own dimension in "the dark") was literally an ocean of blood that he lived in.

Basically, I have an Ender Quarry set up to four golden chests, and at the end of the chests I take out all redstone and cobble. The cobble goes to a Magma Crucible to generate lava. The redstone is sent to a Heated Redstone generator, which is powering the quarry and the Magma Crucible easily.The issue is that it keeps disappearing. Not a chunk reset, just everything connected with the machinery, including the chests. It only seems to happen when I unload the chunk.[Here is my set-up in picture form.](http://imgur.com/1QWqFEX)

Knightmare Frames are advanced war machines, far beyond the tech of actual humans. Before I get to feats, Suzaku has also been hit with a Geass command from Lelouch to simply "not die."

So, was Ned gay for Robert when they were Jon Arryn's fosterlings and later during the rebellion?Not saying that there was an actual physical relationship (and Robert would be probably unaware of Ned's thoughts) but it seems like something *more* than brotherly-type love...I actually made this connection while also watching House of Cards and there was [a scene at the military academy](http://www.bina007.com/2013/02/hoc-8.html) drawing a similar parallel, with even more hints at that.Could this be an [Achilles and Patroclus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_and_Patroclus) kind of relationship?

Why would he think the coming of the long night imminent? Could it be because he has made a deal with the followers of the Great Other (and / or) the Storm God? What has he promised the warlocks of Qarth for their service? And why would he give the Valyrian dragon horn to Victarion, without seemingly worrying about what Victarion might really do with it?

1oze55	-59563	1382457224	TalesFromRetail	"You're closed? Can you still make us a pizza?"	I work at a pizza place centered mostly in New England. We usually close around 10 o'clock on weekdays. I'll be honest the only time I ever make an effort to pick up the phone is when we are closed after a hard day, because I enjoy nothing more than telling people we are closed after dealing with the shallow end of the gene pool all day. I don't usually become a smart ass with people when I tell them we are closed, just a nice "Thanks for calling but I'm sorry we are closed" but when people get stupid with me I will get stupid with them. So this is how this particular conversation went down.Me: "Hi, thanks for calling(Insert pizza place name here), I'm sorry but we are closed"To late to the party customer: "Yeah can I get a large cheese pizza"(usually a sign that this will be a *fun* conversation)Me:"I'm sorry sir but we are closed."TLTTPC: "What?! Are you sure?"M: "Yes sir"TLTTPC: (Said to someone in the background)"They're closed"*Background mumbling*TLTTPC: "I don't know I'll ask. Can you still deliver?"M: "I don't know I'll ask." I put the phone down, give my manager the are you f**king kidding me look, then pick it back up and say "no, we're closed"TLTTPC:"Oh, ok...."Not the worst story I've seen on here, but this kinda stuff gets old after a while.

Again, this is not the worst story I have seen on here, but I like to believe if you ask stupid questions you get stupid answers, and just so you know I **HATE** when customers think it is okay to poke their heads through our driver door.So this is how this mornings interaction went down. On Sundays we open at eleven. Head poker (HP), shows up at 10:30. Sometimes customers call early to set timed orders, so when this interaction happened I was on the phone.*I see HP in my peripheral vision go up to one of our doors. obviously it is locked. Then he comes over to driver door and spots me*HP: HEY!*I put down the phone and look at him*HP: You guys open?Me: Was the door locked?HP: yeah....?Me: What do you think?*HP looks less than pleased and leaves*TL;DR: **STAY AWAY FROM MY SPECIAL DOOR**

For me is  "el flaco" Pastore.He has been the most exciting Copa America player to watch. he has so much class. Much better than Messi as far as overall performance during the entire cup (even though Messi was phenomenal today)top 3 would be-Pastore (best overall)-Messi (insane performance today)-Paolo Guerrero (outstanding player. he made a good Peruvian team into actual title contenders) Honorable mentions: Ospina has probably been the best keeper so far

It is hard not to be beating myself up and I know it isn't helpful so I am trying to be positive.  On the plus side, it was my shortest relapse and I called someone to help me instead of trying to ween myself.  Also, in this year of on again and off again sobriety I have more days sober in 2014 than the last 3 years combined.  I was also able to start a conversation with my SO.  I know it is going to take work and figuring out what to do differently but the shame of the relapse was only going to drive me farther into a bottle instead of scaring me sober.

I have to sit through and feel everything.  I really don't want to; I want to escape and blur into the background.  Logically I do not want to drink but emotionally is different.

Yes, today was a difficult day but I was super busy and barely had time to even think about entertaining the cravings.  Today, I just accepted that they exist and when they popped up I told myself "I've given 5 years to this, I'm going to try this now.  I would rather study and build my life up" and then proceeded to study, go to class, go to counseling, go to SMART.  Tomorrow is another day but tonight when my head hits the pillow I will be sober.

I want just one day to say screw it!  One day to hide from responsibility, and one day to have one bottle all to myself.  I know these are lies-anything I would escape today I would reap 10 fold and have more anxiety over later.  And more likely than not I would not stop at one day.  My entrie future could be derailed if I give in to this today.  Off to study and build the life I want.  For the next 6 hours I will not drink.
2gihj7	-59582	1410827527	stopdrinking	Cunning, baffling, powerful	Now I'm not huge ino AA.  I've been before, and I still go occassionally but I am not currently working the program.  That being said, this hit me today 'Remember we deal with alcohol-cunning, baffling, powerful.'  I was already struggling today and was trying to keep to a strict plan of school work and a few other activites to keep me active.  At the beginning of the day I wanted to climb in a bottle and hide from the world-I move past it and begin studying and a few assignements get done and addict me thinks "Hey!  I've done great!  I deserve a break!"  Sane me reels me back in.  I play the tape forward and move on with my day.  I walk my dogs, run an errand and I'm about to go for a run.  Well I get interrupted shortly after my warm up and struggle.  But the thing is-my own alcoholic brain is what interrupted my short run.  It was a stupid excuse I didn't even realize until an hour later of white-knuckling.  I realized I was tricking myself into thinking I couldn't run today, that it was too early to make dinner, ONE HUNDRED other reasons.  In the moment I thought I had legit reasons to quit-and the second I quit the voice started with the reasons and the excuses.  And that is when this hit me-cunning, baffling, powerful.  It was coming at me and my guard was down.  It took being honest with myself and I am relieved.

2gk0u9	-59582	1410872665	AskVet	Please help, out of money, out of options?	So we have exhausted what we set aside after we had to rebuild it from using it earlier this year.  We have spent $700 (USD) on one of our dogs in the past two months.  We noticed on Thursday she (7, Chiuaua mix, 17 lbs) was acting funny and she had these little bumps that were raising under her fur and disappearing within hours.  She also could not hold any food or water down.  She was still pooping and it was solid.  We took her to the vet at 1 am Sunday morning.  They drew blood and said that revealed nothing. She had a bit of a temp. They gave us an anti nausea medication and a few antibiotics (her 3rd round this year).  We haven't seen any bumps on her in 24 hours, she is drinking a little water but still no food.  She is eating grass.Should we wait and see if she can eat and if we wait how long should we wait?  She hasn't been into anything out of the ordinary.  We will come up with the money no matter what.  We have spent over 1,100 on her this year not including her checkup.

With that said, the real estate market is slowly coming back but it is nowhere close to what it was prior to the bubble in 2008.  This makes it a very good time to invest, as prices are still relatively low and interest rates are low (depending on your credit also).  Prior to the bubble bursting in 2008, there was not a decrease in real estate equity between the end of WWII and 2008.  I'd take the odds that real estate will be another safe investment for the next decade.  In order to maximize future profits through equity, investing now is a must.

With the universal TRIM support by apple in OS update 10.10.4, it allows my new 850 EVO SSD to be supported, however this is also one of the "third party SSDs" that could run into a problem with corruption using apples TRIM that it warns against. I'm using it for personal use and not sure whether I should turn it on and pray, not use it at all, or if there is a fix to this.Please help!

(everything is produced by ZyXEL)A modem type P2812Three switches in three different floors type ES-1528 connected through fibre linkA Hotspot Router type N4100Two Access points type NWA1124NITwo other access points of different type.Neither the modem nor hotspot can read tagged Vlan so that's not an optionSo, the producers told me to set up internett connection through the switch to the admin net access points and create a Vlan with PVID on a few ports for the hotspot. I duplicated this on all switches.So Vlan 1 is all 24 ports untagged (default, can't be removed)Vlan 2 is port 19-24 untagged. These ports have PVID 2The hotspot is connected through port 24. Two access points are on the two other switches, set to get signal only from Vlan 2. The admin net AP are set to Vlan 1.Now this should in theory work. But it doesn't. The ap locks up, doesn't work and so on. When i plug both the modem and the hotspot into the router the dhcp crashes and i can't get them to work simoltaniosly.Can anybody help? what am i doing wrong?

I want to extend the fastening points from wrist to elbow on the arms and ankle to knee on the legs. All four places fastened with a wide leather strap.The pipe in the middle is planned to have a thick leather padding around it instead of the current cushioning. There is also plans for a wide leather "belt" that goes over the hips of the bound person so they are strapped to the bar in the middle (pipe). The entire frame is rethought so that part will be pretty different, but the idea is doable. And with leather cuffs on arms/legs it will take about a minute to strap somebody in. When cash starts to flow i'll construct my improved version and post pics. I've had a friend tied up with the current works but it's too rickety and not enough support as many have said. But! it was functional to tie her up and spin her around. It just needs a bit of tweaking for longer sessions.

yll2e	-59610	1345581669	Homebrewing	Figured I'd share my new kegerator build...	I started piecing it together when I picked up one of [these] (http://www.bestbuy.com/site/KitchenAid---Architect-6.0-Cu.-Ft.-Frost-Free-Compact-Refrigerator---Other/8017442.p?id=1156607143252&amp;skuId=8017442) at a local secondhand warehouse for only $100, in stainless![Here's](http://imgur.com/m0je4) the build shortly after I completed the tower blower and insulator.  Given the size of it I'm able to get 2x 1/6bbls and a 5lb CO2 tank with a dual pressure regulator in it. A bit of trigonometery tells me *theoretically* I should be able to get a full 1/2 keg in it with the CO2 tank on the exterior. I plan on going directly to kegging when I finish my homebrew setup (still collecting supplies). So until then I guess I'll just have to suffer through having crafts on tap :D.

1195yj	-59610	1349881506	bikewrench	What wheels will fit this bike?	I recently was given a mid 80s kia 24 bike. It doesn't appear to be the greatest bike after what i've read but this one is in such excellent shape I'm thinking of slapping some alumn. rims on it.Obviously the stock ones are steel and terrible all around. I'm unsure what wheels it would take, unsure about the gearing and break clearance. Would something like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Sta-Tru-Silver-Alloy-Freewheel-24X1-5-Inch/dp/B004YJ2IF8/ref=sr_1_23?s=cycling&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349881419&amp;sr=1-23&amp;keywords=24) work in the rear?

1198d9	-59610	1349883899	Homebrewing	Lets talk wort chillers.	Has anyone looked at the efficiency of your standard garden hose, copper coil cooler as compared to a closed system with a radiator and condenser?I could build a copper coil flow through setup but it seems messy and cumbersome, and, not all that efficient to boot. Also, I've seen people put a "pre-chiller" coil in an ice bucket ahead of it entering the wort. This also doesn't seem super effective.I guess the real question here is: How fast do I need to chill down the wort? Is faster always better or am I not going to see an improvement from chilling in ~30min vs 15min or 10min.I've also thought about using automotive coolers such as [This](http://www.amazon.com/Hayden-Automotive-403-Ultra-Cool-Transmission/dp/B000C39C9A/ref=pd_sim_sbs_auto_3) inplace of a copper coil as it would seem to me that most the heat transfer occours within the first section of coil and the rest is not actively conducting heat away.

It's a custom built windows 7 DT unit, I can get specific specs if you wish.Here's the issue though: When her cat jumps on top of the computer it freezes momentarily. Hitting/tapping/slapping the computer doesn't do it. As far as I can tell nothing but the cat jumping on it causes the issue. Strange, right?We'll my initial response was "move the unit, don't let the cat jump on it" Not possible b/c of space I suppose.My first thought was maybe it was disturbing the seating of one of the components, but, as far as I can tell all is okay. Any ideas?

After my recovery week I decided to do week 2 again as I didn't feel ready for Max.The first week was pretty brutal and now that I'm in the middle of week 2 I'm noticing my energy levels are droping off a lot. Yesterday during MaxCardio/CardioAbs. I started getting excessively fatigued towards the end and ended up not even doing CardioAbs.I'm wondering what this could be? It's almost like I feel like my body's not getting enough oxygen, but my HR isn't excessive (150-160). It's a bit hot in my house but that didn't stop me during the first 6 weeks. Am I not eating enough during the day? I drink lots of water supplemented with amino acids and salts. No thermogenics or anything like that. Usually drink 1 protein shake after every workout which is also when I eat my largest meal.

It needs to come down. When I say large I mean ~ 60-75ft tall. The trunk is very straight and probably has a solid section of 15-20 ft of 4'-5' diameter trunk.I've read that holly is an extremely white wood, somewhat rare, and when dried correctly can be very beautiful worth quite a bit.The tree must be at least 100+ years old. It's taller than a full grown maple on the property. I think it may even predate the house (1921).Any tips on how to tackle this? I'm considering building a solar kiln in my back yard if the investment is worth it.
1hx1dm	-59610	1373347010	HVAC	Purchased new home, some HVAC concerns.	Hi all! I recently purchased an ~ 1800 sq foot 1921 craftsman style bungalow. The house has a central air system about 6 years old. The ductwork and all are relatively new from what I can tell. As i've been gutting the house I've noticed some blatant but easy to fix issues which I've already corrected:A supply vent which the duct had fallen away from the floorDozens of large air leaks in the supply ductworkA huge air leak in the return ductwork that was sucking in lots of basement air. The former owners also used a cheapo washable filter which I've replaced with a standard fiberglass filter.I have some additional concerns though; in sealing the opening of the return ductwork in the basement I noticed that when the air handler switches on the return ductwork seems to contract A LOT (like the sides of the duct pull in ~ 2-4 inches). I haven't seen enough systems up close to know if this is normal; but I worry that too much strain is being put on the handler.Upon inspecting the return vents I discovered there's only one return vent on the main level. It seems that all of the return air is pulled from ceiling height (9 ft) in the living room next to the stairs.  Is this normal?? The upstairs only accounts for ~ 700 of the 1800 sq/ft home. I'm worried that without two returns or a large enough single return it's straining the air handler. The upstairs is definitely warmer than the main level.I also noticed there's 3 rooms lacking supply vents; both upstairs and downstairs baths and the upstairs "side room" (an ~ 18x6 ft room). Am I able to just install new ducts and vents if I want them to have supplies?
1hx5g6	-59610	1373351610	electricians	[Help] Bought new home; some electrical concerns.	Hi Everyone!I recently purchased a 1921 Craftsman Style Bungalow in Maryland.I've been gutting the house and it's empty right now. As i've been working I've noticed some "peculiar" electrical work. First; the house originally had K&amp;T wiring but It's been upgraded to a modern breaker which has a subpanel coming off it. I however have noticed that some of the junctions in the basement supply from modern wiring into old K&amp;T wiring. Not all; just some. These mostly lead to the second floor and some first floor bedrooms. The kitchen appears to all be GFCI (except the fridge) and modern wiring. There's a socket in each bathroom which is modern with GFCI as well. What has me concerned is:A) Why did they not replace all the wiring? I worry that almost 100 year old wiring is not 90c and/or may have insulation corrosion.B) I've noticed at least 2 open splices INTO K&amp;T wiring (really worrisome).What would it cost to have an electrician come in and evaluate the entire system to separate what's dangerous from what just needs updating?

1jaw9m	-59610	1375131650	HVAC	Proper way to size return ductwork?	I recently purchased a house which has a pretty new HVAC system (5 years).It's come to my attention though, that the ductwork is garbage; especially the returns.The supply runs into a main that feeds 7 main floor vents. The main then runs vertical through the dead center of the house to the attic where it feeds 4 additional vents connected by flex tubing.The return however is interesting. I've come to the conclusion is at LEAST way undersized. Working from the air handler it goes into a main that is fed off a single panned joist. This then feeds into a sealed chamber that surrounds the supply ductwork. It ends at the ceiling of the main level with a single 24" square grille. From what i've read it's not taboo to have supply duct in the return. But, its so undersized the blower is working supremely hard. Also, there's no return upstairs so the upstairs is quite warm.Come sept/oct when it's cooler out I want to completely redo the return but I'm not sure how to size it.

1onm3v	-59610	1382030178	Homebrewing	Lets talk electrical for a second.	Hi all,I'm posting this out of concern of some things I've seen in, what otherwise are very ingenuitive builds, over the last year or so.I ask, please, be mindful in your builds of the power and responsibility that comes with electrical wiring; especially AC circuits. I've seen a lot of makeshift receptacle and junction boxes built out of very non-kosher things (sometimes even flammable!). I'm no expert by any means but, I've done enough wiring in and out of homes to know why these previsions exist. At least please use an approved junction box with approved k/o connectors. Something like: [This](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Steel-City-2-Gang-Square-Electrical-Box-521711234EW-30R/202590467#.UmAZxVCfhe4) with [This](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Halex-3-8-in-Twin-Screw-Non-Metallic-Cable-Clamp-Connectors-5-Pack-20511/100133208#.UmAaV1CfiY8)Be sure to use wire nuts and sheath the cable to the proper lengths. Also, if you're using metal boxes be sure to GROUND the box and the receptacle/switch.Outdoor rated boxes may not be a bad choice too since this is /r/Homebrewing and we're often wet. Also, in the same context we should really be using GCFI rated receptacles here as we're around water a lot.Id hate to see one of these neat builds go up in smoke or worse someone get injured.

Hi, quick picking of the brain.My sump is on a GFCI (per code), like many others during a heavy rain a few weeks ago it tripped the socket and we didn't realize it until we had a few inches of water in the basement. Luckily there was no damage, but, it was a huge headache and could have done some harm if we hadn't caught it. I've been looking at different ways of preventing this like failed circuit alarms ect. Would it be kosher to replace the sump plug with a self resetting GFCI plug like those you see on hot tubs?

1s4jll	-59610	1386207540	HVAC	Help reworking ductwork in home?	Hi, thanks for reading HVAC aficionados. I'm sure you get asked about proper ductwork and system sizing all the time but, hear me out please.We bought our house about 5 months ago in the middle of summer. The AC was not very effective (poor cooling, high utilities). When I looked into the HVAC system I found what I think is the culprit: Drastically undersized and improperly pulled return air.The systems are Trane: xb13 3 ton cooling and xb80 gas furnace. The return stack is 8"x24"x8' and runs to a panned 8"x16"x 12' floor joist. That's not the worst part though. The joist just then opens up to a hall closet FLOOR with a 3.5"x18" opening with no grille. From what I can tell they then installed a return grille in the wall to make it look like a return (great).The good news is it looks like that's the main thing they half assed and the rest of the system looks legit.[HERE](http://imgur.com/flUb8I9) is a diagram of the ductworkThere's two trunks that come off the main: 8"x14"x6' (feeds 3 6" rounds)8"x24"x12'(feeds 4 6" rounds)Then off the second trunk a 8"x24"x22' runs to the attic where 4 6" flex lines &lt;10' each serve the upper floor.I'm planning on completely redoing the return stack to proper size, no panned joists, and having the main return grill pull from ceiling level of the ground floor (9' off the floor). I'll add a return on the second floor if necessary. I'd also like to add another register on the first and second floors (downstairs bath and upstairs closet).Any pointers you guys can give about properly sizing the return and adding the other registers?

Then when he got in he started pointing things out on the bill (that were basically lies) and tried to get me to switch providers.

I have a dehumidifier and can rig up a drying box with an incandescent bulb.As for the carving, would the best way be to cut it to a manageable block like 6"^3 and then carve by hand with chisels, or should I use my drill press to remove the bulk of the material and then shape with chisels?

28w0rj	-59610	1403545085	electricians	Question on getting things inspected.	Hi, we purchased our home around a year ago.It's electric wasn't in terrible shape but being a 100y/o home it had various ages of electrical. One thing to note is i've never seen an inspection tab or label on any of it.To my best knowledge everything is in good working order. The main panel is an older QO 20 space from my best guess being the late 70s. Everything appears to be in good shape, no corrosion, no double taps, decently organized. We recently replaced an old sub panel that was incorrectly connected (hots directly to the main lugs) with a new 12 space and corrected any issues in the sub panel, along with 2 old k/t circuits replaced (the last of them).I've also spent some time fixing general wiring issues; securing wires properly, grounding metal boxes.My question is; how do I go about getting all these things inspected, should I ask our electrician to do a whole house evaluation or pull permits for everything and have a city inspector out? I want any new work to be up to code but also and old violations corrected.

2u3ygi	-59610	1422558071	personalfinance	Getting engaged on a budget.	Hi everyone, my girlfriend and I have been together for over 4 years. We own a home together and are well on our path to marriage (even if we're moving out of order). We're 26 &amp; 27, she's finished her masters and working and I'm close to finishing my PhD and making an okay salary. We're not engaged yet because, frankly, the cost of engagement plus marriage has me worried. We have student debt as well as revolving debt, a car loan and mortgage on a home we're renovating. We're paying on all of these (reducing and starting to build a savings) and living within our income but we don't have much that's expendable.Luckily we're both rational and relatively easy going people. We've discussed many options to reduce our overall cost, such as public parks, cupcakes instead of cake, making our own beer (I homebrew), having our bartender friends bar tend &amp; getting an independent caterer (even buffet style). However I'm looking for advice on all fronts on how to keep this from bankrupting us. As far as the ring goes, I have an old engagement ring already which was given to me by family. It has a nice stone and was hoping I could save by getting it re-set. However, All the estimates I've gotten for nice settings have ranged from 1500-2500; which seems high to me. Any additional thoughts on this front?Also, I have no clue how we'll afford a honeymoon.Help me get over the psychological hump /r/personalfinance; I'm worried as soon as the ring goes on, the countdown starts to being broke.

2ycen1	-59610	1425830107	Roofing	Re-flashing dormer with slate siding. How to approach.	Hi everyone. We own a 95 year old bungalow which has two large dormers. The dormers still have the original slates as siding. We've been having roof problems which are occurring at the dormer wall flashings; they're currently lead and I suspect to be the original flashings which have been reused again and again.I'd like to re roof from the roof line of the dormers down and reflash in the process (the steep portion is only ~ 6 years old). I'm unsure of how to approach removing the slates in an unbroken state. I understand how to rip and pull a normal roofing slate however, since these are so close to the roof line I don't see how I can get a ripper under the slates. Should I remove slates 1 level above the bottom and then remove the bottom? How should I go about putting the slates back up afterwards; I'm assuming you don't want to hang a whole row of slates with slate hooks. We'd really like to retain the slate on the dormers.Additionally; does anyone have any recommendations for high quality 3 tab singles? I was looking at owens corning traditional and they seemed very thin.Pictures of dormer: http://imgur.com/gallery/OI3pP/new
2zdnio	-59610	1426617812	electricians	Advice on detached garage sub-service.	Hi everyone I'm looking for some advice as I redo my detached garage. The original structure is very sturdy double wythe brick build before 1950. The original roof was allowed to decay and I am now replacing it entirely. While doing this I'd like to redo the electrical service. Currently it's supplied with a single 12/3 wire on a 20amp circuit which is in poor shape. I'm going to completely rerun the supply. The garage is only about 25 feet from the house and between the house and garage is our rear deck. Could I theoretically bury only part of the conduit run and then run the rest above grade, underneath the deck, along one of the deck joists to where it would enter the house? I have questions regarding service size and wiring. Currently I only see myself running lights and a few receptacles in the garage for various tools. Additionally, I would like to run a 3hp compressor in the garage. I was thinking two 20amp circuits for lights and receptacles and a 30amp for the compressor should be sufficient. Keeping future applications in mind, I've played with the idea of A) placing an electric vehicle charger in the garage, and B) eventually installing a photo-voltaic system on top of the garage (flat roof, strong walls, ideal for panels).For the EVC I was thinking a 40amp circuit at least would be required for a majority of chargers ([ex](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FA44WX2/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_2?pf_rd_p=1944687522&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=B008RZXWNM&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=05A3M8ZP3NZRMTS5SJYT)). So this would have me at 2x20a, 1x30a, and 1x40a breakers. Is 100a service overkill in this scenario? I assume the EVC and Compressor would not be in use at the same time.I assume adding a photovoltaic system is whole different ballgame however and am curious what steps I could take now to prepare the new system to accept that in the future.
383u9g	-59610	1433180285	gardening	Why are my cucumber plants wilting away? :(	Two nights ago one of our cucumber plants seemingly over night completely wilted and wouldn't respond to watering. We pulled it for fear of disease spreading to other plants.Yesterday one of the remaining two plants started showing the same symptoms (farther away from the original). The larger leaves seem to be collapsing while the smaller ones are not; also the stem seems weak. I've tried several tests for bacterial wilt but don't see any of the normal positive results. I also haven't noticed any unsual pest activity and there aren't any spots or yellowing of the plants. When I pulled the original plant it seemed like its root system was strong. I'm at a loss here; I'm afraid we're going to lose all of our cucs and that it will spread to our other melon/squash. I bombed the plants with DE today and fed them a liquid fertilizer.It has been unseasonably hot here over the last week but they've been getting water daily.http://imgur.com/LUWzocT

I have never been happier. I haven't had a "real" smoke since friday, and now even my husband smells bad when he does! I'm so happy!I've got grape drink flavor right now from ivape.net - and am so excited to discover more. Any and all affordable, yummy flavor suggestions are welcome!
181iwm	-59616	1360206515	electronic_cigarette	Is finding flavors you like always hard?	I ordered Grape Drink and Fruity Juicy Gum from ivape.net -- really liked the grape drink, but after almost a week, i'm already tired of it -- so i switched to the fruity juicy gum. Was really let down by it. It's good and all, but almost weak-ish in flavor, and i think the Nic is wrong from it...I'm waiting on an order from Vapor Chef with 4 of the SMALL bottles, so i can try them - but my husband is getting upset because i keep finding flavors i want to try, and he's afraid i wont like them and will waste the money.I know people suggest flavors all the time, but i've learned it really is to each-their-own with vaping flavors...Will it always be this hard?

1ivra6	-59621	1374585053	Harley	Do you ride helmet or no helmet?	I'm just curious where everybody stands on this issue.  My wife and I are halfsies on them.  When we go on the long rides we wear helmets, but if we are just going somewhere in town we don't.  What about you guys and gals?
1jf8bg	-59621	1375281333	Harley	Have a question about a sound I'm hearing on my bike???	Ok I have an 05 Dyna wide glide.  32K miles on it.  Great condition, bike rides fantastic, sounds good, BUT what I believe to be the clutch, I am hearing a clicking noise.  When I have the Clutch pulled in it still clicks just not as fast.  I can hear it as I'm accelerating the clicking gets faster.  So I've test my theory on it being the clutch.  I was going about 35 in 2nd and the clicking sound was going pretty fast then i pulled the clutch in to coast and the clicking  noise slowed down just like it does when i am at a stand still.Has anyone ran into this problem before?  I've check the bolts up front too.  Nothing loose.  Just want to know do I have a potentially big problem and need to take it in right away or is this a normal sound from the clutch or possibly something else?  I just think its the clutch, but i could def be wrong!

Both cam chain tensioner shoes were worn pretty bad and one was on the verge of completely shattering.   Avoided a bullet there.  I replace all 4 tapit rollers too since i was already in that area and put in adjustable pushrods.   Bike fired right up and ran good..... still the knocking noise in the same place.....  any more suggestions?  im thinking a rocker arm or a valve now...

We are going to draw numbers 1-10 to see what the order is.  Ok here is the my dilema:What should my draft order be-1st:RB 2nd: RB 3rd: QB 4th: WR 5th: TE 6th: WR or1st:RB 2nd: RB 3rd: WR  4th: TE 5th: QB 6th: WRIs it not a good idea to draft two RB's right off the bat?  I know there a good amount of legit QB's and not a good amount of legit TE's so i almost feel i should draft a TE before a WR.Any input is appreciated.  I draft this saturday.

ebdc9	-59624	1290641792	AskReddit	What kind of Laptops would Reddit recommend?	So Reddit, this month has been... interesting. My desktop finally bit the big one when the PSU surged (that's a VERY fun smell!) and my Laptop is a heaping pile of crap. (Acer Aspire 5515) with a battery that lasts for 6 minutes and 4 seconds (I timed it for fun! &gt;_&gt;), a broken graphics card (verticle lines on the screen, green splotches) and it'll only stay on for about an hour before it overheats and shuts down.I bought it for about $300, but I only got 2 and a half years of LIGHT use out of it, so I'm really not interested in buying ANYTHING Acer anymore.I'm wanting a laptop that can handle maybe some decent games, Starcraft II, and maybe Call of Duty: Black Ops.However, I'm on a bit of a budget, seeing as how I just had a baby, and I don't have a great deal of disposable income. Any suggestions?
fos64	-59624	1298167007	AskReddit	Going for Firefighter in the Air National Guard, any tips or advice?	So, I have had the want to become a firefighter for quite a while, and I am being told that the easiest way to do it is to go into the Air National Guard and have them pay for it. We have a local air base here so that's where I would be stationed (hopefully), and I've been told that our local fire department likes to hire from the Air Guard. At current I am trying to get down to the proper weight requirements before I go and waste a recruiters time. (5' 8", 194lbs at current). Apparently I need to be able to run 1 and a half miles in 11 minutes, at current I can only manage .75 miles within 14 minutes, so that needs to be addressed too. I'm trying to train to get better. Besides physical requirements and the like, what else should I do or what else do I need to join the air guard for firefighting? Are there any tips that you lot can give me that would help me succeed?

ilfli	-59624	1310277647	guns	To buy, or not to buy?	Hello Gunnit! My experience with handguns is very miniscule, but I have a working knowledge of the calibers. Enough to get me by, or get me in trouble... I have been looking at two of the guns that I have wanted for a LONG time lately, and now I have the money to buy them. On both counts, MANY people have warned me off of them, saying ammo is hard to find, expensive, and unreliable. For both. The first gun that I want to buy is an Israeli Military Industries Jericho 941, chambered in both .41 AE, and 9mm. The second, is not a specific gun, but a caliber. I'm looking at buying something in 10mm, and I am leaning towards purchasing an EAA Witness / Tangfoglio gun for this caliber.I have been told this is a bad idea from numerous people I know. My reasons are different for both. The Jericho is dead sexy, and I just want it for the looks, and the ability to throw some .41 AE through it. The 10mm I want because as far as I can tell, it is the cheapest / most practical hand cannon round that I can find, and I wants me some stoppin' power. (I realize my 9mm +p+ can put a man down just fine with one shot center mass with no trouble, but I want overkill dammit!)Any suggestions / advice?

mnp7l	-59624	1322120782	guns	Fullsize, or Compact?	So I've been using a Springfield XD Sub-Compact 9mm as my carry gun for a while, and I like it, but I'm getting tired of it. I'm considering going to a Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P Compact for the better feel of the gun. One of the questions I'm asking myself is.. What's the point in going compact? I feel I can comfortably carry a full sized gun most of the time and I don't notice any different in printing with my 13 round mag with pierce grip extension, or my 16 round full sized mag on my XD. So gunnit.. Should I go with the Compact just in case, or should I go full-sized? I know only I can decide what's best for me, but I want some opinions on the merits and disadvantages of both, things that I maybe haven't thought about. Another thing that got me started on this is that the M&amp;Pc with it's pinky mag plate does not look much smaller than a full-sized version. 
n3bhb	-59624	1323223161	guns	Is this normal?	http://imgur.com/wiQul - Picture of a target from my range trip today. The outlined area is from 15 feet, fired as fast as I could pull the trigger.Ignore the rest of the holes. They were made by .40 cal and other stuff. My main wonder is... I CANNOT get groupings that good (Yes, I know to some of you that grouping is awful, but I'm working on it..) when aiming from 21 feet, but bearing down and just unloading from 15 feet, I can hit like that? Is there something I'm doing wrong? I'm left handed, and when shooting pistols, everything I shoot is right, and low, and it's usually all over the paper, but with this, I was pretty much right on at where I was aiming.

n7np9	-59624	1323545831	guns	What "OSHI-" moments have you had Gunnit? 	I'll start. I used to live in Kansas when I moved out of my parents house. First month out, and I was always a bit paranoid, cause we lived in a pretty shady trailer park. One day I was sitting in my 'office' on the computer, .45 EAA Witness next to me, and I see a shadow pass my window on the way to my front door. Look outside and see a white truck parked near my trailer that I don't recognize and some big rough looking dude walking to my door. I start to get up to go check who it is, when I hear my locked door handle jiggle. I grabbed my gun, set up in a position where I was half in/half out of my office doorway with the gun pointed at the door. My door then swings open as the man uses a key to open it and steps into my trailer and looks right at me. After he nearly shits himself he tells me he's here to replace the filters for my air conditioner. He's the park maintenance man. I don't think my heart has ever beat that fast in my life.  
nzgaq	-59624	1325482915	guns	Christmas came a bit late! But it's not unwelcome. Dillon Precision RL 1050.	http://imgur.com/AwjftSo the story behind this beauty is my father bought one when my mom was into competition shooting at KCR. We'd reload thousands of rounds a month, and she'd blow through them all, so the thing was a great investment. Fast forward many many years, and this thing has sat, forgotten in the basement, rusting.. I finally remember that they have it, and talk to dad about cleaning it up and using it. He says go ahead, and gives it to me.So now I have the press, the electronic blue hopper thing that sits at the top. A 9mm upper assembly as well as one for .45, and a bunch of other neat stuff like a tumbler, dillon electronic scale, etc.. My only problem now is, I don't even know how to reload at this point, and I DEFINITELY don't know how to operate, or even rebuild this machine. The instruction manual that came with it is going to get much use tomorrow, and dad says he's going to teach me how to use it. Once I get it de-rusted and cleaned I think I'm gonna take it in for powder coating, get some materials and start a wonderful new hobby. Any suggestions from the more-learned people from gunnit?

qdd1m	-59624	1330632843	CCW	A Better Holster for CCW?	Hi CCW! First post here as I just discovered the subreddit. I've been carrying for approx. 3-4 months now with a Springfield XD Sub-Compact 3" 9mm in a Crossbreed Supertuck. Here's my problem:I'm a bit pudgy. 5' 8" and 215lbs, so I have a bit of a gut, but I'm not overly fat. The Crossbreed seems to be very uncomfortable for me in everything but 6 o'clock carry which I am being told is a massive no-no due to safety concerns. When I wear it at anything but 6, the holster's leather seems to dig into my stomach when I sit down and is extremely uncomfortable.I'm fairly certain this is due to the aforementioned pudginess which I am working to fix, but for the present, is there anything I can do to make carrying more comfortable? The way I carry is with a Blackhawk TDU 1.5" belt, jeans and a t-shirt. I have been looking at holsters like the Comp-Tac CTAC, which looks very skeletonized and looks like it might work better, but I'm not sure. Has anyone had the chance to use both the supertuck and the ctac? Any insight on which is more comfortable?
qy5u9	-59624	1331838032	guns	How many of you have ever been in a life or death situation? What are your stories?  	I've had one experience in my life that was particularly scary. This was about 3 years ago. I was 20 years old working overnight alone at a gas station, but it wasn't in a bad part of town, just a fairly empty part. It was about 2AM on a Sunday, and I was cleaning out equipment and had my back to the door. I hear someone come in, and I turn around to say hello, but see no one. I start looking around, and then I see this dude coming around one of our large displays in a ski mask, holding a gun. Guy points it right at me and says "Give me your money". At this point, I have several friends who I know would probably play a joke along these lines, so I laugh and say "Right, you expect me to believe that?"At this point, he racks the slide on his gun and says that he's not joking. The sound of it made me fairly certain that it was a real gun, so I decided not to press my luck. I went over, emptied my drawer, and this dude got pissed because I had just made a safe drop about 10 minutes earlier, and just had $70 in the drawer. He tells me to open the safe we have sitting right next to the register. I don't hesitate in popping the lower door which housed about $300 in bills and $20 in change for when we needed it and handed it all to him. All throughout this, I was considering hitting the silent alarm he had next to the register, but decided it wasn't worth the risk. Also had a tire iron near the register as well, but as the old saying goes, I'm not bring anything but a gun to a gun fight.After the dude got his money, he told me to get in the back office and lay down on my stomach. I was extremely apprehensive at this point, and seriously considering turning and taking my chances, but I complied. The guy said not to get up, that he'd be watching, and took off. I waited until I heard the door, looked at the security feed overlooking our parking lot and saw him running off. Immediately I hit the silent alarm he had (Thank God I didn't do it while he was there, because it's a spring loaded switch, and made a loud "PING!" when I depressed it that would NOT have gone un-noticed), and then picked up the phone and called the police. I had 5 patrol cars there in literally 45 seconds. My city isn't small... They were all half a mile away at another gas station, getting coffee.... -_-.Unfortunately, they were too late and the guy got away, but not for much longer. He eventually got caught after robbing several other places around town. Especially after picking his girlfriend up from work at a Sonic, then coming back half an hour later in the same car, and robbing them...Here's a news story about the guy's conviction: http://www.newspressnow.com/localnews/27137559/detail.html

Alright gunnit, I've done some searching, and I think I have found a solution, but I want to verify.I have a buddy who has just gotten into guns and wants to CCW. I helped him pick what gun he wants, what holster, etc.. But, in conversation, he says that he has a Felony Suspended Imposition of Sentence for theft when he was 17/18. What this means is that he was charged with a felony, plead guilty to it, and had the sentence suspended per completion of probation.This means he has not been CONVICTED of a Felony, but he has plead guilty to one. What this means, in Missouri law, is that he can legally purchase and own a handgun, since he was never convicted, but on the missouri CCW application, it clearly states: "Have you ever plead guilty to a felony?"This means he will be denied for a Missouri CCW permit. No if ands or buts. However, I did some looking around, and it looks like he may be able to get a Florida non-resident CCW permit, as their application states "Have you ever been convicted of a Felony?"Is this correct? What advice do you have gunnit?

For me, I have always been a proponent of 9mm as a very good carry round, with a good balance of ballistics, capacity and recoil. For a year I carried a Springfield XD Sub-Compact 9mm with Winchester Ranger-T 127Gr +p+, but I've now switched to carrying a Glock 22 .40S&amp;W with Winchester Ranger-T 165Gr RA40T. I love the ballistics of these rounds as well as the recoil. The reason for the switch is I actually like the recoil of .40 more than I do 9mm nowadays. I don't know why, but I seem to be able to control it better (Get shots on target faster / more accurately) than with 9mm. Anyone else experience this?So Gunnit, what do you carry? 
xoizs	-59624	1344107123	guns	M&amp;P Shield 9mm - Range Report	Manufacturer: Smith &amp; WessonModel: M&amp;P9 ShieldCaliber: 9mmCapacity: 7 or 8 RoundsBarrel Length: 3.1" / 7.874 cmWeight: 19.0 oz / 538.7 gTrigger Pull: 6.5 lbs. +/-So I've had a chance to fire a Shield in the past, but only in a "Hey, can I shoot that?" Kind of way, and didn't have much of a chance to really get a good impression of how the gun feels and functions. My friend recently just bought a Shield, and I had a full day to play around with it and see what I liked and didn't like.What I like:       * Build Quality - You would think for only paying $400 dollars for a polymer, striker fired pistol, you might be reaching if you thought it would be every bit as nice as your full-sized duty pistol, but the Shield surprised me. It's very solidly put together, and looks absolutely amazing. You really get a sense that this gun is incredibly sturdy when holding it.   * Ergonomics - The Shield feels fantastic in the hand, even with the flush 7 round magazine. I was able to get a very solid grip on the gun. It does not feel too thin, either. It has the feeling of being 'just right' from the moment I picked it up. It does feel a tiny bit top heavy, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.    *  Recoil &amp; Accuracy - I was very surprised by how well the Shield managed recoil. Using a mix of 115, 124 and even 127gr +p+ loads, it handled everything extremely well, even better than some of the larger pistols that I have had the chance to shoot. Every shot was dead on right where I wanted it to go, and follow up shots / double taps were quick and easy.    * Features - The trigger does take a bit to get used to, but it is very nice. Take-up is short, and the break is very crisp and clean. There is none of the typical mush or grittiness that seems to plague the larger line of M&amp;P Pistols. The reset is very positive and audible, which seems to be another break in tradition from the M&amp;P series.    * The safety is very unobtrusive. I thought I was going to be bothered by it, but I'm really not. It's very solid, and has very distinctive on / off clicks. I completely understand why S&amp;W included it with the gun. A lot of their target audience with this will be women carrying it in their purses, and they want the assurance that the gun will not accidentally discharge. I don't have any more worries that it would be accidentally engaged, but I would still practice to throw it into the off position when carrying just in case.     * The mag release is ambidextrous, in the way that it can be flipped from either right or left, depending on where you want it. Unfortunately this is the only thing on the gun that is ambi.    * Carry - This is a bit good and bad. For those of us who wear jeans on a daily basis, pocket carry might be a bit too much to ask of this pistol. If you have cargo shorts, you will definitely be able to pocket carry in a big pocket, but the jeans crowd might have to stick to IWB or OWB. Either way, carrying is incredibly comfortable. What I don't like: * The Sights - Don't get me wrong, the 3-Dot metal sights are very visible and very durable, but the paint or plastic white dot insert is not. When shooting the 124gr +P Speer Gold Dot, the white insert for the front sight popped off, never to be found again. It's easily fixable, but it's still a bit of a pain. * The Mag Release - While the mag release does not stick out or snag as much like on a full sized gun, the placement is a bit awkward for left handed people. When shooting the gun, my middle finger engaged the release twice, causing the mag to become unseated. Lefties will definitely want to switch the release to the right side, even if, like me, you prefer to use the index finger of your left hand to depress the release.That about sums up my thoughts on the pistol. I like it VERY much, and will be getting one as soon as I am able to. Not quite sure if I will go for 9, or .40 yet, as I have a bunch of .40 ammunition for my primary carry gun (Glock 22) so I will have to wait and see on that.Hoped this helped anyone who was on the fence at all. I'm not a professional reviewer by any means, but I still wanted to get my thoughts out on it.

Some say I'll blind myself, others say I'll burn my face off. What are your thoughts /r/guns? Here is my current CCW / EDC weapon: http://imgur.com/X9STL (The picture was taken on a cell phone, at night in a kitchen. I did the best I could.)Details on my setup - I really don't know. I do not know who designed or manufactured my barrel / slide setup. 
10xd4k	-59624	1349336803	guns	Range Report: Bersa BP9CC	Manufacturer: BersaModel: BP9CCCaliber: 9mmCapacity: 8+1 (Single Stack)Barrel Length: 3.3"Weight: 21.5oz UnloadedTriger Pull: 4.5lbs +/-So an FFL buddy of mine got this pistol in about a week ago and he wanted to go try it out. I do not own this pistol, but I am very tempted to buy one after the range session. http://olegvolk.net/gallery/d/42328-2/bersa_BP9CC_C5L_7325web.jpg (Picture obviously taken from Olegvolk, as none of my shitty cell phone pictures looked decent.)What I Like:    * Ergonomics - I was immediately impressed with how well this gun felt in the hand. It points very naturally and doesn't have the awkward feel of some of the larger or smaller guns on the market. This gun is thin. 0.94" to be exact, and it is very noticeable in how it feels in your hand and on your side. The slide serrations are very grippy (Is that a word? I don't think it is. I'm using it anyways.). They're very reminiscent of the M&amp;P line of serrations, except less abrasive and in my personal opinion, more effective.    * Trigger - This is a love it, or hate it kind of trigger. It is kind of wide for the size of the gun it is on and is unique in design. It doesn't use the glock-style safe-action trigger with the nub in the middle, and it doesn't use the M&amp;P style hinged trigger. The trigger basically pivots at some point and allows the mechanism to be pulled with enough pressure towards the bottom half. (I'm terrible at explaining this.) At first it felt a little awkward, but after firing several hundred rounds through it, I got used to it and it was very functional. It does have a bit of mush, but I've come to expect that from almost every striker-fired handgun. The trigger has a fairly short reset, so follow up shots / double taps can be made very easily.    * Build Quality - Nothing shockingly good in this category, but nothing I could find to really gripe about in the overall quality of the pistol. In the several hundred rounds we fired, it didn't malfunction once. (Federal 9mm Wal-Mart value pack, Speer Gold Dot 124Gr +P, Winchester Ranger-T 127gr +P+).    * Recoil - This isn't a sub-compact pistol, so I came in expecting it to handle the recoil of a 9mm well, and it did. Regular, +P and +P+ all fared very well, and I had a hard time telling which was which between the Speer and the Federal. The Winchester was obviously a bit more stout, but it was still very manageable.    * Loaded Chamber Indicator - I like this. It offers a tactile assurance that there is a round sitting ready in the chamber, and at a glance tells you whether or not the gun is hot. I would not trust this in any way shape or form, and I would still visually verify that the chamber is empty when handling, cleaning and disassembling the gun, but it's still a nice feature.    * Carry - Unfortunately we did not have a holster designed for this pistol on hand, but we did have one for a Kahr, which, coincidentally is almost the exact same size and shape, save a few things such as trigger guard shape. It was very comfortable and very concealable. This succeeds in almost every possible category that the compact pistol competes in. What I Don't Like:    * The Sights - They're cheap and they're plastic. I understand to keep costs down, Bersa had to skimp somewhere, but I expected a bit better. They get the job done, without a doubt, but the overall impression left me a bit discouraged. As well, if you go to replace them, you have to source different spec'd parts. The rear uses Glock sights, the front uses Sig.    * The Slide Lock - This thing is large and intrusive. It's not snag-free and I can see it becoming a problem if your method of carry and choice of clothing is not correct.    * Mag Release - It's ambidextrous, which is nice, but it also has some issues. I don't know if it is just because the gun is new, but it took some pushing to get it to engage. This may be a plus to those who are concerned about their holsters activating the mag release accidentally.    * Internal Locking Mechanism - This thing is asinine, period. Those are my thoughts. It's a solid choice for someone considering a compact-sized pistol, and competes directly with the Kahr CW9 (Which it does very well.).

As with all my my range reports, this is a pistol I do not own. I'm too poor to go around buying everything, so I get hands on time through things that friends buy, or receive in their shop. This comes from a buddy who just bought it about a month ago, and so far, he loves it. With that said, lets get on with it. What I Like:    * Ergonomics - I really love the feel of this gun. It feels very well proportioned and feels fantastic to my medium-sized mitts. I found it points very naturally and needs very little if any correction to bring the sights in line when drawing from a holster. As well, the grip texture does very well the keep the gun firmly seated where you want it. With the flush mag, I was actually able to  get a full grip on the pistol if I tried / scrunched my fingers close together enough, but most shooters will be using a two-fingered grip.   * Trigger - I have had quite a bit of experience with XD triggers from my time owning and carrying the XD Sub-Compact 9mm, and this trigger is a world apart from typical XD triggers. It has a very short take up, and a crisp break. You get none of the typical mush from the XD line of triggers. As well, the reset is very audible and tactile, and the best comparison I can make is to the Glock in how it functions / feels. It's a very welcome improvment over any XD trigger I have felt previously.    * Build Quality / Reliability - I didn't know what to expect from this gun, as it was a completely new design, but I was hoping it would be good for the amount of money that SA is asking for it. I'm happy to report that it does not disappoint in this area. Everything seems to be made of high quality materials / machining, and I could find nothing to fault the pistol for in this area except for some minor issues when chambering a round. When loading a round on an empty chamber + full mag, you have to haul back hard and let the slide go right at the end of it's travel to get a new round to chamber correctly. This is good practice for all firearms, but seems to be a necessity for this one. Besides that little nagging detail, the pistol performed well with all types of ammo that was fed to it from cheap Winchester FMJ to Federal HST 230gr, it didn't have a single hiccup from either the flush mag, or the extended mag.    * Loaded Chamber Indicator - As typical from the XD line, the loaded chamber indicator is back, and as I've mentioned before, I really like this feature. It's not something to be used as a substitute for good safety practices, but something to augment them. This is my personal opinion anyways, but I really do like the feature.    * The Sights - Very high quality metal / fiber sights. The rear sights are your standard steel dovetail / dot sights. The front sight is a high visibility red open-top fiber sight. During the day time, at least, this is a very nice setup and it is incredibly easy to reaquire sight picture during firing. I would not suggest keeping the standard sights if you are going to use this for its intended purpose, which is concealed carry, obviously. I'd be looking at a set of TruGlos or Trijicons, but for out of the box sights, these really can't be beat.    * Carry - Some people will say that this is a 'Pocket Gun, but at least for the jeans and t-shirt crowd, this will not be the case. If you have cargo pants, sure, go for it, but jean pockets simply cannot accomidate this thing comfortably or without printing pretty badly. It IS thin. 1" wide to be precise, and that makes it very concealable in an IWB or OWB holster, but I found pocket carry impossible with my attire. During the days I was able to carry the gun, it disappeared under my t-shirt in both IWB and OWB and it felt as light and well proportioned on the hip as the M&amp;P Shield, or Bersa BP9CC. The grip texture was a bit irritating at first, but I got used to it. What I Don't Like:    * Recoil - Some people will say the recoil is manageable, and they're right. The recoil is very manageable for what it is. I have only ever fired .45 ACP out of large revolvers and full sized 1911s, so the recoil did surprise me a bit. I typically associated .45 with a soft but firm push, but out of the XD-S, it feels more like a hard snap that I would usually expect from .40 S&amp;W. This may not be an issue for most people, but I just didn't like it all that much. That said, I was still able to produce a very respectable grouping at 25 yards.    * Cost - This pistol is expensive. In a world where polymer 'pocket pistols' hover around the $3-500 dollar price range, this is firmly in the $600 and up price range. Considering that SA is one of the first, if not the first to produce a .45 ACP semi-auto pistol this small, this isn't surprising, but there's still the feeling of sticker shock when you look at the price tag in the gun shop.    * Capacity - For some, 5+1 rounds are adequet enough to get the job done, especially when it's .45 ACP, but I would prefer 7-8. I realize that this is a physical limitation due to the size of the pistol and the size of the round, but it's just a personal gripe of mine. So those are my thoughts on this nice little pistol. The pro's highly outweigh the cons, and the cons are all subjective, so you may find every single one of them to be null. Personally I wouldn't buy one unless it was released in 9, or .40 and the price dropped a bit, but if recoil, cost and capacity are not a concern for you, the XD-S does very well as a sub-compact / compact .45

I'd be looking at a set of TruGlos or Trijicons, but for out of the box sights, these really can't be beat.    * Carry - Some people will say that this is a 'Pocket Gun, but at least for the jeans and t-shirt crowd, this will not be the case. If you have cargo pants, sure, go for it, but jean pockets simply cannot accomidate this thing comfortably or without printing pretty badly. It IS thin. 1" wide to be precise, and that makes it very concealable in an IWB or OWB holster, but I found pocket carry impossible with my attire. During the days I was able to carry the gun, it disappeared under my t-shirt in both IWB and OWB and it felt as light and well proportioned on the hip as the M&amp;P Shield, or Bersa BP9CC. The grip texture was a bit irritating at first, but I got used to it. What I Don't Like:    * Recoil - Some people will say the recoil is manageable, and they're right. The recoil is very manageable for what it is. I have only ever fired .45 ACP out of large revolvers and full sized 1911s, so the recoil did surprise me a bit. I typically associated .45 with a soft but firm push, but out of the XD-S, it feels more like a hard snap that I would usually expect from .40 S&amp;W. This may not be an issue for most people, but I just didn't like it all that much. That said, I was still able to produce a very respectable grouping at 25 yards.    * Cost - This pistol is expensive. In a world where polymer 'pocket pistols' hover around the $3-500 dollar price range, this is firmly in the $600 and up price range. Considering that SA is one of the first, if not the first to produce a .45 ACP semi-auto pistol this small, this isn't surprising, but there's still the feeling of sticker shock when you look at the price tag in the gun shop.    * Capacity - For some, 5+1 rounds are adequet enough to get the job done, especially when it's .45 ACP, but I would prefer 7-8. I realize that this is a physical limitation due to the size of the pistol and the size of the round, but it's just a personal gripe of mine. So those are my thoughts on this nice little pistol. The pro's highly outweigh the cons, and the cons are all subjective, so you may find every single one of them to be null. Personally I wouldn't buy one unless it was released in 9, or .40 and the price dropped a bit, but if recoil, cost and capacity are not a concern for you, the XD-S does very well as a sub-compact / compact .45

11xooq	-59624	1350976722	Glocks	Oil Selection	We all know about Glock's legendary reliability, but the gun requires standard maintenance just like any other firearm. What oils do you all use? I'm fond of Mobil 1 20W50 V-Twin. Not a gun oil, I know, but I have a link that will explain why. http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=271x1301I've done my own testing with Mobil 1 on a Glock 26, 23 and my own 22. I even put my own Glock through a not entirely torturous torture test of 2,000 rounds without cleaning while using the Mobil 1, and it functioned just as flawlessly if not better than when I used other oils. It seems to function a lot smoother most of the time as well.
12br7n	-59624	1351577314	Glocks	Glock 19 Grip Chop - Has anyone done it?	So, I've been reconsidering my carry gun lately, as my Glock 22 is effing large, and doesn't conceal well for social events such as birthday parties and the like. I like the Glock 19, but the grip feels wonky and isn't much of an improvement over the Glock 22's size, but I still want the long sight radius and the 4" barrel. This in mind, I have considered getting a Glock 19 and chopping the grip to accept Glock 26 mags.Has anyone done this before, or had first hand experience with a Glock that has had this done? If so, how did it feel / operate?

195vdf	-59624	1361753862	guns	Range &amp; Carry Report: FNH FNS 9mm	Manufacturer: FN HerstalModel: FNS-9Caliber: 9x19mm NATO Capacity: 17+1Barrel Length: 4"Weight: 25.0oz UnloadedTriger Pull: 6.0lbs +/-MSRP: $599http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/fns_9_d-tfb.jpg - Pic taken from The Firearm Blog, because as I've mentioned before, my picture taking skills are shit. This is a bit different from my other range reports, as I liked this pistol so much that I bought it. I've been needing a second pistol for a while, and while I love my Glock 22, I like this better. I also decided caliber diversity was a good goal and switched to 9mm for this pistol. This version came with Trijicon night sights, and out the door, with a 50 round box of Winchester Ranger-T 127gr +P+, I paid $549.What I Like:    * Ergonomics - It's why I bought the gun. The FNS feels FANTASTIC in the hand. It comes with interchangeable backstraps, a rounded and a flat one. I immediately changed to the flat backstrap and haven't considered changing back. The best way I can describe it is it feels like a doublestack 1911, and is one of the most comfortable pistols I have ever laid hands on.      The grip stippling is very aggressive, and it makes and impression after shooting for quite a while, but it's not uncomfortable when shooting and aids greatly in control of the firearm.   * Trigger - The trigger is not the best striker-fired trigger I'ved ever used, but it's not the worst either. It's a hinged trigger, kind of like what the M&amp;P uses, but it's useless for any actual safety, as the lower portion of the hinge does not reset after it gets depressed slightly, so anything can actuate the trigger after it has been depressed the first time. There is a slight amount of take-up before a clean break, right at about 6lbs, and the reset, while not short by any means, is quite positive.     I have been told the the trigger will break in a bit better after 500 rounds, and I'm really looking forward to that.    * Reliability - Out of 350 rounds fired during my initial range trip, I had no malfunctions of any kind. The pistol ate everything fed to it, from WWB to Federal bulk for range ammo, as well as Speer Gold Dot 124gr +P, and Winchester Ranger-T +P+. The biggest surprise was that it cycled light powered 115gr reloads that were specifically loaded to JUST cycle in an MP5. It went through a good 50 of those without any hiccups as well. Overall I am very impressed with reliability, and will be doing more extensive 1-2,000 round test at a later date.    * Loaded Chamber Indicator - While not as tactile or as visible as the XD, or SR-series of pistols (The FNS uses an extractor-type indicator like the Glock), the loaded chamber indicator is still a nice feature to have. It sticks out just enough that during the night, you can definitely feel a difference, as well it has a small amount of red paint along the top of it for visual inspection.    * The Sights - Trijicon night sights, factory mounted from FN. They aren't the brightest on the market, but they seem very durable and are very clear and precise.   * Recoil / Accuracy - This is a full-sized polymer-framed pistol chambered in 9mm. Recoil is extremely minimal when using standard pressure ammunition, and does not increase in any significance when using +P or +P+ loadings. Followup shots are quick and precise, and incredibly easy. The grip stippling, angle of grip, and general design of the pistol lend itself to very quick and accurate shots.     Grouping at 10 yards was around 3-4", which for me, isn't bad. I'm not exactly the world's greatest marksman, so I was very pleased with this grouping, especially when compared to shooting a Glock or M&amp;P of the same caliber.    * Ambidextrous Controls - Every single control on the FNS is ambidextrous except for the take-down lever, which doesn't need to be. Mag release, slide-stop and manual safety. All controls are very easy to reach and easy to actuate.    * Manual Safety - Yes, I know what you're thinking. A manual safety on a striker fired gun is unnecessary, and you're right. The FNS comes both with and without a manual safety. Unfortunately the gun shop I purchased mine from did not have the ones without the safety, but I honestly don't mind it. It's not intrusive, and this is a gun I frequently carry off-body in a Maxpedition Versa-carry bag when the situations limits me from on-body carry, and I do like the added safety during those situations.What I Don't Like:    * Build Quality - Let me be clear here. The pistol itself, the polymer frame and slide are very robust, and built very well. My gripe however, is with the finish on the slide. It scrapes and wears very easily, and I'm not sure what this will mean for the condition of the pistol further down the line. I don't really care how it looks, but my main concern is rust somewhere down the line.     * Ambidextrous Mag Release - I both love, and dislike this mag release. It is VERY positive, and easy to actuate. This causes a bit of a problem, however. It sticks out so much that it is easily depressed by a holster or a misaligned finger. I wish that FN had sunk it a bit deeper into the frame, or made the release a flat button as opposed to a rounded one, as this would have made it better for carry. Carry: I have carried this pistol for about a week now, both on-body and off-body. I trust it as my daily carry, and I'm very pleased with it. Holsters are easy to find, and are standard fair when fitting and positioning.I do have a few gripes, and these are that the aggressive stippling on the grip causes a fair amount of irritation on bare skin, and that the pistol is a bit wider than other options such as the Glock, M&amp;P and XD/XDm series, and weighs a tiny bit more, but these are very minor. Overall I love this pistol, and am very happy with my purchase. It is rapidly becoming one of my favorite pistols, and if it can bring the same level of reliability and durability down the line as a Glock or XD, it will have secured a permanent place as my preferred carry gun.

Guess who went over? I was previously able to circumvent this ban by spoofing the wireless mac on my phone to a different one, but this was with an EVO 4G, not my current Note II. I went and rooted my Note II last night, put it on CyanogenMod 10.1, and downloaded Mac Address Ghost, which is a program which has worked for me in the past. I followed all the instructions and told it to spoof the MAC, but it didn't do it, even though it said it did. I tried two other programs that claim to spoof the MAC, but nothing worked. I tried manually changing it using terminal and using the commands subusybox iplink showbusybox ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 28:BB:4A:0A:AB:30Even this doesn't change it, however I get no errors whatsoever.

1jxmrv	-59624	1375933999	guns	Range Report: Springfield XDm .45 3.8 Compact	Manufacturer: Springfield Armory USAModel: XDm 3.8 CompactCaliber: .45 ACPCapacity: 9+1 (Compact Mag) / 13+1 (Full Sized Mag)Barrel Length: 3.8"Weight: 27oz Unloaded w/ flush mag, 29oz w/ extended mag. Triger Pull: 5.5-7.7lbs +/-MSRP: $600http://northeastshooters.com/images/Compact45_1x.jpgImage credit: North East ShootersA friend of mine recently purchased this firearm, along with an XDs for his EDC. Being very familiar with the XD series of pistols, as I currently alternate between a Glock 22, and an XD9SC for my daily carry, I asked him if we could go shoot it, and if I could carry it for a few days to see if I liked it. I have never really been a fan of .45 ACP due to how costly it is to train with, and the limited capacity, but I decided to give this a try to see how it felt. What I Like:    * Ergonomics - I'm kind of on the fence about how the XDm feels in the hand. It doesn't feel as blocky as a Glock, but also doesn't feel as good as my regular XD. It points naturally, but does feel a tiny bit awkward without a pinky extension. With the pinky extension, it feels perfect, but it also adds bulk to the grip, which hurts the concealability. The grip texture of the XDm is also very aggressive, which makes it very easy to hold on to during firing, but can tear up your hand during a great deal of firing. For now, I'll add this as a pro, since this is still the most comfortable polymer .45 pistol I have handled.   * Build Quality / Reliability - Having owned and carried an XD for several years, I expected the XDm to exceed my expectations in this category, and was not disappointed. The build quality on the XDm series feels very solid and sturdy. When we brought this to the range, we wanted to outright hammer it to test how it would fair. We ran a total of 1,197 rounds through it with no cleaning. (My friend went a bit overboard a while back on stocking up on .45)    400 rounds of TULA 230gr   397 rounds of WWB 230gr   300 rounds of low power reloads   100 rounds of Federal HST 230gr +P   Everything performed flawlessly in the XDm, except for the WWB. We tossed two rounds from two different boxes - one because there was significant setback to the round, the other because of case damage around the bullet where it looked like it was seated incorrectly. The third bullet we think is a dead primer - it chambered and the striker hit the primer causing an indent, but the round did not fire. We waited 2 minutes before unchambering, re-chambering, and trying it again. After two tries we tossed that round, and went on with the rest.    During this time, the barrel / front of the slide did get very hot, and I was worried we were damaging the finish on the gun, as it was getting a lot of discoloration near the muzzle, but this turned out to just be dirt / power from the rounds fired upon later inspection / cleaning.    * Loaded Chamber Indicator / Striker Indicator - As typical from the XD line, the loaded chamber indicator and striker status indicator is back, and as I've mentioned before, I really like these features. They're not something to be used as a substitute for good safety practices, but something to augment them. This is my personal opinion anyways, but I really do like these features.    * The Sights - I've always liked the fact that the XD and XDm series came with metal 3 dot sights. The sights are very durable, and clear, making it very easy to reacquire sight picture and perform followup shots. The XDm series seems to differ from the XD series a bit here, as the sights are pushed all the way to the back of the slide, giving XDm a slightly longer sight radius.    * Carry - During my time carrying the XDm, I noticed no difference in how the pistol felt as far as the shape, and dimensions. It fit perfectly in my cross-breed supertuck which was designed for the XD9SC. Retention was great, and position was spot on. The only area where the XDm felt different was weight. You can definitely tell it's a bit heavier, but overall it didn't bother me.   * Capacity - 10 rounds of .45 ACP is nothing to sneeze at in a carry gun, especially for how small this pistol is. I still prefer 9mm for the capacity gains, but I would not feel under-gunned with this pistol.   * Recoil - In recent years, my experience with .45 ACP has been with full sized 1911s, and the XDs. The 1911 makes recoil almost non-existent, and the XDs is very snappy, so this being middle ground between the two, I had no idea what to expect. Over the course of the day, I was incredibly surprised with how little recoil the XDm had. Subjectively, it feels less than my 9mm, and I felt like I was much more accurate with it than my XD9SC. What I Don't Like:    * Cost - The XDm series has always been expensive. Typically, I have seen them sell for anywhere between $580-650, which is quite a bit more than I could get a comparable pistol for, such as a Glock, or M&amp;P. Springfield does try to offset this a bit by giving the purchaser every thing they need to carry, or compete in IDPA right out of the box with the XD Gear, but I feel quite a few people would like to see an 'essentials' package in the XDm series, which forgoes the gear for a lower price point.    * The Trigger - One thing I cannot stand about the XD and XDm series is the trigger. It's mushy, does not break clean, and has almost no tactile or audible reset. I really wished Springfield would have addressed this issue in the XDm series, especially since they tout the advantages of their 'match grade' barrel. It's disappointing to see they didn't make the component that makes the most difference match grade. There are still Powder River Precision, and others that provide a drop in or total conversion kit, but that should not be necessary in a $600 firearm. So there we are - I really do like the XDm series. It's great carry gun, and a lot more accurate than I am, and in .45 feels fantastic compared to the Glocks that I have fired. As I said I am disappointed in the trigger, and the pricing, but both are subjective. I don't believe I would purchase the XDm in .45 for myself due the cost of ammunition for training, and capacity, but I would have to think real hard about it if I were to be offered a good deal on one.

The third bullet we think is a dead primer - it chambered and the striker hit the primer causing an indent, but the round did not fire. We waited 2 minutes before unchambering, re-chambering, and trying it again. After two tries we tossed that round, and went on with the rest.    During this time, the barrel / front of the slide did get very hot, and I was worried we were damaging the finish on the gun, as it was getting a lot of discoloration near the muzzle, but this turned out to just be dirt / power from the rounds fired upon later inspection / cleaning.    * Loaded Chamber Indicator / Striker Indicator - As typical from the XD line, the loaded chamber indicator and striker status indicator is back, and as I've mentioned before, I really like these features. They're not something to be used as a substitute for good safety practices, but something to augment them. This is my personal opinion anyways, but I really do like these features.    * The Sights - I've always liked the fact that the XD and XDm series came with metal 3 dot sights. The sights are very durable, and clear, making it very easy to reacquire sight picture and perform followup shots. The XDm series seems to differ from the XD series a bit here, as the sights are pushed all the way to the back of the slide, giving XDm a slightly longer sight radius.    * Carry - During my time carrying the XDm, I noticed no difference in how the pistol felt as far as the shape, and dimensions. It fit perfectly in my cross-breed supertuck which was designed for the XD9SC. Retention was great, and position was spot on. The only area where the XDm felt different was weight. You can definitely tell it's a bit heavier, but overall it didn't bother me.   * Capacity - 10 rounds of .45 ACP is nothing to sneeze at in a carry gun, especially for how small this pistol is. I still prefer 9mm for the capacity gains, but I would not feel under-gunned with this pistol.   * Recoil - In recent years, my experience with .45 ACP has been with full sized 1911s, and the XDs. The 1911 makes recoil almost non-existent, and the XDs is very snappy, so this being middle ground between the two, I had no idea what to expect. Over the course of the day, I was incredibly surprised with how little recoil the XDm had. Subjectively, it feels less than my 9mm, and I felt like I was much more accurate with it than my XD9SC. What I Don't Like:    * Cost - The XDm series has always been expensive. Typically, I have seen them sell for anywhere between $580-650, which is quite a bit more than I could get a comparable pistol for, such as a Glock, or M&amp;P. Springfield does try to offset this a bit by giving the purchaser every thing they need to carry, or compete in IDPA right out of the box with the XD Gear, but I feel quite a few people would like to see an 'essentials' package in the XDm series, which forgoes the gear for a lower price point.    * The Trigger - One thing I cannot stand about the XD and XDm series is the trigger. It's mushy, does not break clean, and has almost no tactile or audible reset. I really wished Springfield would have addressed this issue in the XDm series, especially since they tout the advantages of their 'match grade' barrel. It's disappointing to see they didn't make the component that makes the most difference match grade. There are still Powder River Precision, and others that provide a drop in or total conversion kit, but that should not be necessary in a $600 firearm. So there we are - I really do like the XDm series. It's great carry gun, and a lot more accurate than I am, and in .45 feels fantastic compared to the Glocks that I have fired. As I said I am disappointed in the trigger, and the pricing, but both are subjective. I don't believe I would purchase the XDm in .45 for myself due the cost of ammunition for training, and capacity, but I would have to think real hard about it if I were to be offered a good deal on one.

This firearm is of particular interest to me due to the fact that it is almost the exact same size as a Springfield XD, which is what I currently carry when I want a small firearm.What I Like:    * Ergonomics - The Ultra Carry feels fantastic in the hand. It's got a very nice balance of it's weight, and feels 'just right'. I don't know if this is the right term for it, but then length of pull, between my palm and to the trigger feels very nice, and my finger sat perfectly on the trigger. This is a bit different from some striker fired pistols I've had a chance to handle lately. The positioning of the safety / decocker, and the slide lock do seem a bit bunched up and awkwardly spaced, but that can't be helped on a pistol this small.    * Reliability - I really didn't know what to expect here. Bersa as a company is really beginning to gain my appreciation due to their recent products and the quality of them, and I had high hopes for this pistol in this category.      We put a total of 300 rounds through the Ultra Carry. A mix of FMJ and JHP. The first magazine through the gun had 2 failures to eject using Federal 115gr FMJ. After this magazine, however, we had no issues with the Federal, and progressed to Hornady Critical Duty 135gr, and Federal HST 124gr +P. Both loads cycled well, and had no issues.   * Capacity - 13+1 rounds of 9mm is very respectable in a firearm of this size. You could still do a bit better in this form factor if you went with a Glock, or a bit worse on capacity if you chose a Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P9C. 1 or 2 rounds isn't much of a difference, and it all comes down to what your personal preference in firearms is, but this budget minded Bersa can still keep pace with the more well known competitors in this category.     * Recoil - It's a 9mm, so light recoil is to be expected. Recoil in the Ultra Carry is very manageable and seems to be a bit less snappy in comparison to my XD, or even a Glock 26.   * The Trigger - The trigger is very nice in double-action mode. Pull is long, but smooth and predictable.    * Rail - Plain and simple, it has a rail for mounting small lights, or, if it's your thing - lasers. What I Don't Like:    * Safety / Decocker - The Ultra Carry has an ambidextrous safety / decocker mounted on the frame. I understand the need for a safety on a DA/SA firearm, but I dislike the decocker. You can carry this firearm with the safety on, but not with the hammer cocked. This is a minor annoyance, but one that has stuck with me during my time with it.    * The Trigger - The trigger in single action feels a bit weird. It might be that I'm just used to single action revolver triggers, but the Ultra Carry's trigger in single action still what seemed to be a long amount of travel before it dropped the hammer. The resistance was a lot less than double action, but I usually anticipate very little or no travel on a single action trigger.   * Carry - While the Ultra Carry is lighter than the XD that I am used to carrying, it's also wider. This definitely noticeable in an IWB holster.  As someone who likes Bersa products quite a bit, I am conflicted on this one. Personally, if I were going to buy a new carry firearm, I would stick with either a Glock 19, or a S&amp;W M&amp;P9c, but this is mostly due to the fact that I like striker-fired polymer pistols more than hammer fired alloy/steel ones. I believe that if you DO want something hammer-fired then this should be a strong contender if you're on a budget, but overall I didn't like this one very much.

1ovpc9	-59624	1382327998	guns	Question about legality / etiquette for an interaction at a gun show today.	So I went to a local gun show today and was browsing around when I saw an XDs .45 at a table and decided to take a look because I was curious if the store owner (who is local, and one of the biggest assholes on the planet) had a new model that wasn't affected by the recall, or if he had received stock back from Springfield. As I get there, there's two or three people also looking at the XDs but they're not in serious conversation and it's still laying on the table. I get the owner's attention and ask if the gun has been sent in for the recall. He states it is a new production and did not need it. I look closer and note the serial number, which is clearly not new production, as a friend had an XDs with a higher serial, and it had to be sent in. I pull up my phone, go to the recall page, and then check the serial number... Lo and behold, it's slated for recall. I inform the owner of this, and by this point he is beginning to get pissed, as the people who WERE looking at the XDs are now mumbling and asking questions to themselves about it, and he states it has been sent in and fixed and that he recently received it back. So he's completely changed his story now, and he's clearly lying as to my knowledge no one has received their gun back, and it did not have a roll pin in the grip safety, which should be present from what I know of the recall process. As well, Springfield's website should have indicated that the gun had already been sent in if this were the case, or am I mistaken on this point? I decided to push it a bit and point out that the roll pin was not present, and that he had already changed his story when he told me to leave his table.I left, made the obligatory Facebook post warning friends who I knew were going to the show, and went about my day.From an etiquette stand point, was I in the wrong for calling him out at his table / in front of potential customers?From a legal stand point, could he be held liable if that gun ended up injuring someone in the future due to the recall related fault if he made the claim that it was safe and had been through the recall?

We can't really find any pricing or any auctions on gunbroker to give us a basic price as to what to sell this thing for.

Features I am looking at are a rail, ambi safety and night sights are a plus. This will be a carry and home defense gun.

It began with random apps force closing and quickly progressed into huge lag times between selecting an action and having it carried out. If I press the home button, it takes approximately 5-8 seconds for anything to happen. Some apps my lock up entirely and take 45 seconds to a minute before the phone responds again. I have tried different roms, wiping both internal memory and the ext. SD card, unrooting and returning to stock, I have even tried a different battery as some have suggested, but nothing has worked.The only thing I can think of would be, looking in my battery statistics, it shows that there are points where my screen is on, but the phone is not awake. I have included a screen shot to illustrate this. I have also included a screen shot of my baseband and any other potentially relevant info.Does anyone have any other suggestions here?http://i.imgur.com/m3GIEydh.jpghttp://i.imgur.com/WVyPdBs.png

I came to this phone from a Samsung Galaxy Note II with a ZeroLemon 9200mAh extended battery. I loved the large screen, and the ability to go several days without charging my device, even after extremely heavy usage. (Several hours of Netflix, Youtube, Pandora, mobile gaming and remote desktop applications per day at full brightness on a mix of LTE and WiFi) I had no idea what to expect of this phone. I’ve owned several HTC devices before such as the G1, HTC HD2, and the EVO 4G and was always impressed with the devices, but not HTC’s customer service. Due to a bad experience with their support, my next phone was the Samsung Galaxy SIII which I had for a month before trading for a Note II due to my love of phablets. The Note II started dying early into 2014 and I decided I needed a new phone. I’m not really impressed with Samsung’s approach to Android. Touchwiz is a bloated and ugly mess which ruins a lot of the experience for me, and I don’t really like Samsung’s ‘throw all the gimmicky features at the flagship to see what sticks’ approach either. After watching and reading several reviews, and handling the HTC One M8 and the Galaxy S5 in stores, I decided I would give HTC another chance. The S5 felt iterative, like it’s nothing special, just another bland offering which improves everything just enough from the last device to justify calling it a new phone. Immediately what stood out to me when holding the HTC One was the outstanding build quality. The fit and finish are near perfect and it feels robust and sturdy due to the weight. Everything about the phone feels premium, like there were no corners cut, and no expenses spared to make it look and feel fantastic. The design is strangely proportioned, and the phone is quite tall, but after a week or so, this no longer bothered me as I got used to it. One area where I feel HTC could have done better is the HTC logo at the bottom of the screen. I understand that they have stated that this space is necessary, but it still detracts from the overall aesthetic of the device and is the one glaring flaw that still bugs me.One major gripe I have is concerning the build of the phone, but it’s not a ding against HTC’s design, just the material. Aluminum is amazing. It looks and feels fantastic and really makes the phone stand out among it’s rivals, but the one problem I have run into is heat. Holy balls the M8 gets hot. Not just make your hand sweaty hot, but actually noticeably uncomfortably hot. Imagine the early Macbook Pro and how it lightly seared the outside of your legs, and then concentrate that into the back of a phone. Yes, I’m exaggerating here, but it’s a major issue for me. A case has solved this. Battery life is alright. Not what I am accustomed to, but it's nothing that sends me running for the charger.  The display is very sharp and crisp, and colors seem accurately represented. Viewing angles are fantastic. The brightness, while not as bright as other devices I have, such as the Nexus 7 (2013) is still adequate for outside daytime use, and you will not struggle to make out anything on the screen. The speakers… Where do I even begin with these? I watched several Youtube videos comparing the speakers with other devices, and you really cannot get a sense of just how loud and clear these speakers are without experiencing them first hand. There is simply no device out on the market today that can compete with the audio experience the HTC One M8 provides, and this is one of the main reasons I bought the phone, as I frequently use it to watch videos and stream music without headphones. My morning alarm is loud enough to wake the dead, and if I have the volume up all the way on the ringer, it can startle me quite a bit when it goes off. Since purchasing the phone, I have been able to compare it side by side against a Galaxy S5, and the LG G2. The S5 feels noticeably slower and jerkier than the HTC One M8 in many aspects. The area where you notice this the most is transitioning in and out of apps, as well as using the multi-tasking menu. There is just so much of a gap in performance here that it has me wondering how much of the processing power of the 801 is being devoted to dealing with Touchwiz. Things are not so clear when comparing to the LG G2. While the M8 is very quick and snappy, the G2 seems more fluid and polished. This could be down to LG’s overlay, and if it is I have to give them praise for it, as it doesn’t seem to cause any appreciable resource drain on the processor. With that said, I do prefer Sense over LG’s offering, as it seems much closer to a stock Android experience and at least to me, feels more functional. HTC has incorporated LG’s tap-to-wake feature into the M8, and while I thought this was a bit of a gimmick at first, I don’t think I could go to another phone without it at this point. It is extremely useful, especially due to the placement of the power button at the top of the phone. They have also introduced swipe gestures that allow you to swipe up, down, left or right on the screen to access certain areas or features of the device. Swiping right brings you to Blink Feed, swiping left brings you to the home screen, swiping up takes you to the area you were at before you locked the phone, and swiping down activates voice calling. On that last note, some people have expressed a dislike for HTC’s voice features, stating that they are inaccurate, or clumsy. At least in my use, voice dialing has been spot on every time, and very responsive. I’ve not had a single issue with this feature and it adds a great deal of functionality to the phone. Another feature that I love is HTC’s TV app, with the IR blaster. I have several TVs, and Tivo boxes. I also have small children. This means that after the first few days of owning each device, the remotes were lost to oblivion. We’ll probably find them when we happen upon the pile of socks that my dryer keeps eating. This feature, combined with how the TV app automatically wakes the device when you pick it up while in the app interface makes the M8 incredibly useful to me. Now on to the bit where everyone is a bit ‘meh’… The camera. Yes, it’s only 4 megapixels, and it really is outperformed in almost every respect when compared to other devices, even in low light, which is one of the areas where HTC was hoping it would shine. I honestly cannot understand HTC’s decision making process here. The M7’s camera was lackluster, and was received poorly. What made them think that sticking with the same design was a smart idea? If they would have included a regular camera with optical image stabilization, it would have been fantastic, and the phone would be a lot more marketable. That said, I am not a professional photographer. I take pictures and videos and I post them to Facebook, or Youtube. I watch these videos on my phone, and I look at the pictures there as well. On Facebook, or a 5-7” device, the quality differences are honestly not very noticeable to me. Everything from the camera is just good enough to not be a detriment to the device, but it’s nothing to praise either. If someone from HTC is reading this – Please, for the love of whatever deity you hold dear, don’t keep the 4 megapixel camera on upcoming devices.I have included several pictures and videos from my use of the M8, including videos shot in ‘Fast HD’ (1080P, 60FPS) and you can make your own determination on the quality. These weren't taken specifically for quality, just in the moment kind of things. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o44KPJNQ8H8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58MCFwvTPkghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ar0huFLtIpEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9CsadYaJVQhttps://imgur.com/a/sY8kR-------------------------------------------------------------http://ca.crackberry.com/images/product_images/accessories/additional_images/17797/large/4.jpgAs a bonus, I have a mini-review of the Urban Armor Gear Outland (Rust Orange) case for the M8. As I said, I absolutely love the look and the feel of the phone outside of the case. It is a fantastically pretty device, and it’s a shame to have it confined to a case, but due to the aluminum construction and how the aluminum body stops just short of covering the edges of the glass, I had to put a case on it. I found myself gingerly setting the device on desks, and having a mini melt-down every time it slipped a bit in my hand. It was nerve-racking. The fit of the case around the phone is perfect, as expected and the design is pretty to look at. It looks and feels very robust while being slim and light. The plastic is VERY rigid. While this makes taking the phone in and out of the case a pain in the ass, it gives me confidence that it won’t warp or become loose like other cases I have used in the past. The thicker straight edges of the case make gripping and retaining the M8 in your hand a lot easier, and while the plastic is slick, it never feels like it’s going to slide out of your hand. The camera openings on the back of the device are beveled to prevent vignetting, while still being small enough to adequately protect both. The depth of field camera has a slight tear-drop shape to accommodate the orientation of the sensor, allowing it to do it’s job. The buttons on the case are not very pronounced, but they’re easily identifiable and actually make the experience more tactile, as they feel more clicky or positive when using the phone. The power button is also not entirely solid, allowing the IR blaster on the top of the M8 to function as it should, which is a feature that some cases do not support. If I had one thing to complain about on this case, it would be the size of the port openings for the USB cable and the headphone jack. This may be a limitation caused by how close these two are, but I find that I have to remove the case in order to use my headphones. (Audio-Technica M50X, and Shure SE-215). The port for the audio jack is simply too small to use any cable that has any kind of base around the jack itself. Well... That's it. I hope I helped a bit in someone's decision on whether or not to buy this device. Personally I would pick this over every single device on the market right now, and even some upcoming devices. As well, again, sorry if the quality of this review isn't on par with others. Also, for some reason the videos shot in Fast HD (60FPS) don't seem to have retained their smoothness on Youtube. It seems like Youtube may have messed with the quality or with the FPS. Not sure how to confirm that, or how to fix it if that's the case. 
2a80wd	-59624	1404892365	guns	The most retarded question you will see on this sub for months. (Or: How can I successfully grip chop a Five-Seven?)	So I was reading through the sub, and saw someone post their Five-Seven and it reminded me that I have a friend who has two and has been wanting me to chop the grip down on one of them to a sub-compact size. This person has two Five-Seven pistols, a Mk1 and Mk2, he wants me to try this on his Mk1. I will not be held financially responsible if I fuck it up, which I am pretty sure is gonna happen. He doesn't want to do it himself because he has no mechanical or ... really any type of skill that would work here, and I have done quite a few mods recently on other pistols that have come out well. Now, I have no doubt that I can chop the grip comfortably and precisely on the Five-Seven and still retain it's function with a full size magazine. My problem comes from the fact that I would need to create new magazines for this project. I believe I only have 2 options here. Option 1: Take an existing Five-Seven magazine and chop a section from the middle, and then 'weld / glue' the upper and lower sections back together. I have no idea how to retain the strength of the magazine during this process. I'm positive that I can make it feed reliably if I can get the two halves to stay together, but that is the hard part. Option 2: Design and 3D print a new mag and then scavenge and hack up the internals from an existing Five-Seven mag. This would be much more time consuming and I really don't know how well the plastic would hold up under use. Anyone have any better ideas other than not doing it? I've been putting this off specifically because I don't want to ruin his gun, but he's adamant that he gives no fucks if it's destroyed in pursuit of a 'unique' gun.

After the latest update, I can now fly directly through every object on my map for my large carrier and small battle-cruiser. There is no collision detection at all. I cannot even land on the ships with my fighters because the landing gear do not detect anything in proximity. Has anyone had this issue yet?

The wasps are about 2-3cm in length and seem to be rather aggressive when someone gets close to the window. Is it safe to remove this nest myself, or spray it with wasp spray? I'm rather concerned as I have two small children who love to play with bugs of all shapes and sizes and have yet to experience a wasp or bee sting. 
2ha20x	-59624	1411515926	legaladvice	Getting the run around from Ford, what are my options?	Location: Saint Joseph / Gower, Missouri, USA. So my wife and I purchased a used vehicle from a local Ford dealership in Gower, MO. The car was a 2011 Ford Fusion Sport, with 15,000 miles, and still had the factory warranty. We paid $18,000 for it. When we bought it, the salesman said that it had been in a minor wreck, but with new cars these days, any type of wreck would cause frame damage, and that the car was repaired back to 100%. He had us sign a piece of paper that stated that we had been informed of the frame damage. Like idiots, we did not check the carfax report. Well, fast forward a year, and we still had the factory warranty, when our passenger side window stopped working. We took it in for repair, and told us that since the car had been repaired due to being wrecked, the window was no longer covered under warranty... Great. Fast forward another month, and the passenger side trim piece pops off the door. Bumper to bumper warranty... We go in, and are told we pried that piece off ourselves, and it would be $300 to replace. Not really understanding what the warranty is all about, then, and of course, yes, we intentionally mangle our $18,000 car all the time. Now, I have no warranty on the car, and we decided we wanted to get rid of it. This car has every option selectable from the factory. It should be worth quite a bit. We take it to trade in, and we are told that the carfax states it was in a severe accident, with severe frame damage, and is only worth $8,000 at most, at 32,000 miles.Do I have any legal recourse here to at least make Ford inspect or fix the car?

2lampc	-59624	1415132568	gunreviews	[Review] [Springfield Armory] XDs .45 ACP	Manufacturer: Springfield Armory USAModel: XD-SCaliber: .45 ACPCapacity: 5+1 (Single Stack)Barrel Length: 3.3"Weight: 21.5oz UnloadedTriger Pull: 5.0lbs +/-MSRP: $650http://xdspistol.com/images/gallery-left.jpg (Picture obviously taken from Springfield's website, as I don't have an actual camera, and my phone is terrible.) As with all my my range reports / reviews, this is a pistol I do not own. I'm too poor to go around buying everything, so I get hands on time through things that friends buy, or receive in their shop. This comes from a buddy who just bought it about a month ago, and so far, he loves it. With that said, lets get on with it. **What I Like:**    * Ergonomics - I really love the feel of this gun. It feels very well proportioned and feels fantastic to my medium-sized mitts. I found it points very naturally and needs very little if any correction to bring the sights in line when drawing from a holster. As well, the grip texture does very well the keep the gun firmly seated where you want it. With the flush mag, I was actually able to  get a full grip on the pistol if I tried / scrunched my fingers close together enough, but most shooters will be using a two-fingered grip.   * Trigger - I have had quite a bit of experience with XD triggers from my time owning and carrying the XD Sub-Compact 9mm, and this trigger is a world apart from typical XD triggers. It has a very short take up, and a crisp break. You get none of the typical mush from the XD line of triggers. As well, the reset is very audible and tactile, and the best comparison I can make is to the Glock in how it functions / feels. It's a very welcome improvment over any XD trigger I have felt previously.    * Build Quality / Reliability - I didn't know what to expect from this gun, as it was a completely new design, but I was hoping it would be good for the amount of money that SA is asking for it. I'm happy to report that it does not disappoint in this area. Everything seems to be made of high quality materials / machining, and I could find nothing to fault the pistol for in this area except for some minor issues when chambering a round. When loading a round on an empty chamber + full mag, you have to haul back hard and let the slide go right at the end of it's travel to get a new round to chamber correctly. This is good practice for all firearms, but seems to be a necessity for this one. Besides that little nagging detail, the pistol performed well with all types of ammo that was fed to it from cheap Winchester FMJ to Federal HST 230gr, it didn't have a single hiccup from either the flush mag, or the extended mag.    * Loaded Chamber Indicator - As typical from the XD line, the loaded chamber indicator is back, and as I've mentioned before, I really like this feature. It's not something to be used as a substitute for good safety practices, but something to augment them. This is my personal opinion anyways, but I really do like the feature.    * The Sights - Very high quality metal / fiber sights. The rear sights are your standard steel dovetail / dot sights. The front sight is a high visibility red open-top fiber sight. During the day time, at least, this is a very nice setup and it is incredibly easy to reaquire sight picture during firing. I would not suggest keeping the standard sights if you are going to use this for its intended purpose, which is concealed carry, obviously. I'd be looking at a set of TruGlos or Trijicons, but for out of the box sights, these really can't be beat.    * Carry - Some people will say that this is a 'Pocket Gun, but at least for the jeans and t-shirt crowd, this will not be the case. If you have cargo pants, sure, go for it, but jean pockets simply cannot accomidate this thing comfortably or without printing pretty badly. It IS thin. 1" wide to be precise, and that makes it very concealable in an IWB or OWB holster, but I found pocket carry impossible with my attire. During the days I was able to carry the gun, it disappeared under my t-shirt in both IWB and OWB and it felt as light and well proportioned on the hip as the M&amp;P Shield, or Bersa BP9CC. The grip texture was a bit irritating at first, but I got used to it. **What I Don't Like:**    * Recoil - Some people will say the recoil is manageable, and they're right. The recoil is very manageable for what it is. I have only ever fired .45 ACP out of large revolvers and full sized 1911s, so the recoil did surprise me a bit. I typically associated .45 with a soft but firm push, but out of the XD-S, it feels more like a hard snap that I would usually expect from .40 S&amp;W. This may not be an issue for most people, but I just didn't like it all that much. That said, I was still able to produce a very respectable grouping at 25 yards.    * Capacity - For some, 5+1 rounds are adequate enough to get the job done, especially when it's .45 ACP, but I would prefer 7-8. I realize that this is a physical limitation due to the size of the pistol and the size of the round, but it's just a personal gripe of mine. So those are my thoughts on this nice little pistol. The pro's highly outweigh the cons, and the cons are subjective, so you may find them to be null. The XDs is a very nice .45 ACP sub-compact / 'pocket' pistol. 
2lanxh	-59624	1415133170	gunreviews	[Review] [Bersa] BP9CC	Manufacturer: BersaModel: BP9CCCaliber: 9mmCapacity: 8+1 (Single Stack)Barrel Length: 3.3"Weight: 21.5oz UnloadedTriger Pull: 4.5lbs +/-So an FFL buddy of mine got this pistol in about a week ago and he wanted to go try it out. I do not own this pistol, but I am very tempted to buy one after the range session. http://olegvolk.net/gallery/d/42328-2/bersa_BP9CC_C5L_7325web.jpg (Picture obviously taken from Olegvolk, as none of my shitty cell phone pictures looked decent.)**What I Like:**    * Ergonomics - I was immediately impressed with how well this gun felt in the hand. It points very naturally and doesn't have the awkward feel of some of the larger or smaller guns on the market. This gun is thin. 0.94" to be exact, and it is very noticeable in how it feels in your hand and on your side. The slide serrations are very grippy (Is that a word? I don't think it is. I'm using it anyways.). They're very reminiscent of the M&amp;P line of serrations, except less abrasive and in my personal opinion, more effective.    * Trigger - This is a love it, or hate it kind of trigger. It is kind of wide for the size of the gun it is on and is unique in design. It doesn't use the glock-style safe-action trigger with the nub in the middle, and it doesn't use the M&amp;P style hinged trigger. The trigger basically pivots at some point and allows the mechanism to be pulled with enough pressure towards the bottom half. (I'm terrible at explaining this.) At first it felt a little awkward, but after firing several hundred rounds through it, I got used to it and it was very functional. It does have a bit of mush, but I've come to expect that from almost every striker-fired handgun. The trigger has a fairly short reset, so follow up shots / double taps can be made very easily.    * Build Quality - Nothing shockingly good in this category, but nothing I could find to really gripe about in the overall quality of the pistol. In the several hundred rounds we fired, it didn't malfunction once. (Federal 9mm Wal-Mart value pack, Speer Gold Dot 124Gr +P, Winchester Ranger-T 127gr +P+).    * Recoil - This isn't a sub-compact pistol, so I came in expecting it to handle the recoil of a 9mm well, and it did. Regular, +P and +P+ all fared very well, and I had a hard time telling which was which between the Speer and the Federal. The Winchester was obviously a bit more stout, but it was still very manageable.    * Loaded Chamber Indicator - I like this. It offers a tactile assurance that there is a round sitting ready in the chamber, and at a glance tells you whether or not the gun is hot. I would not trust this in any way shape or form, and I would still visually verify that the chamber is empty when handling, cleaning and disassembling the gun, but it's still a nice feature.    * Carry - Unfortunately we did not have a holster designed for this pistol on hand, but we did have one for a Kahr, which, coincidentally is almost the exact same size and shape, save a few things such as trigger guard shape. It was very comfortable and very concealable. This succeeds in almost every possible category that the compact pistol competes in. **What I Don't Like:**    * The Sights - They're cheap and they're plastic. I understand to keep costs down, Bersa had to skimp somewhere, but I expected a bit better. They get the job done, without a doubt, but the overall impression left me a bit discouraged. As well, if you go to replace them, you have to source different spec'd parts. The rear uses Glock sights, the front uses Sig.    * The Slide Lock - This thing is large and intrusive. It's not snag-free and I can see it becoming a problem if your method of carry and choice of clothing is not correct.    * Mag Release - It's ambidextrous, which is nice, but it also has some issues. I don't know if it is just because the gun is new, but it took some pushing to get it to engage. This may be a plus to those who are concerned about their holsters activating the mag release accidentally.    * Internal Locking Mechanism - This thing is asinine, period. Those are my thoughts. It's a solid choice for someone considering a compact-sized pistol, and competes directly with the Kahr CW9 (Which it does very well.). 
2ldr76	-59624	1415207071	gunreviews	[Review] [Springfield Armory] XDm .45 Compact	Manufacturer: Springfield Armory USAModel: XDm 3.8 CompactCaliber: .45 ACPCapacity: 9+1 (Compact Mag) / 13+1 (Full Sized Mag)Barrel Length: 3.8"Weight: 27oz Unloaded w/ flush mag, 29oz w/ extended mag. Triger Pull: 5.5-7.7lbs +/-MSRP: $600http://northeastshooters.com/images/Compact45_1x.jpgImage credit: North East ShootersA friend of mine recently purchased this firearm, along with an XDs for his EDC. Being very familiar with the XD series of pistols, as I currently alternate between a Glock 22, and an XD9SC for my daily carry, I asked him if we could go shoot it, and if I could carry it for a few days to see if I liked it. I have never really been a fan of .45 ACP due to how costly it is to train with, and the limited capacity, but I decided to give this a try to see how it felt. **What I Like:**    * Ergonomics - I'm kind of on the fence about how the XDm feels in the hand. It doesn't feel as blocky as a Glock, but also doesn't feel as good as my regular XD. It points naturally, but does feel a tiny bit awkward without a pinky extension. With the pinky extension, it feels perfect, but it also adds bulk to the grip, which hurts the concealability. The grip texture of the XDm is also very aggressive, which makes it very easy to hold on to during firing, but can tear up your hand during a great deal of firing. For now, I'll add this as a pro, since this is still the most comfortable polymer .45 pistol I have handled.   * Build Quality / Reliability - Having owned and carried an XD for several years, I expected the XDm to exceed my expectations in this category, and was not disappointed. The build quality on the XDm series feels very solid and sturdy. When we brought this to the range, we wanted to outright hammer it to test how it would fair. We ran a total of 1,197 rounds through it with no cleaning. (My friend went a bit overboard a while back on stocking up on .45)    400 rounds of TULA 230gr   397 rounds of WWB 230gr   300 rounds of low power reloads   100 rounds of Federal HST 230gr +P   Everything performed flawlessly in the XDm, except for the WWB. We tossed two rounds from two different boxes - one because there was significant setback to the round, the other because of case damage around the bullet where it looked like it was seated incorrectly. The third bullet we think is a dead primer - it chambered and the striker hit the primer causing an indent, but the round did not fire. We waited 2 minutes before unchambering, re-chambering, and trying it again. After two tries we tossed that round, and went on with the rest.    During this time, the barrel / front of the slide did get very hot, and I was worried we were damaging the finish on the gun, as it was getting a lot of discoloration near the muzzle, but this turned out to just be dirt / power from the rounds fired upon later inspection / cleaning.    * Loaded Chamber Indicator / Striker Indicator - As typical from the XD line, the loaded chamber indicator and striker status indicator is back, and as I've mentioned before, I really like these features. They're not something to be used as a substitute for good safety practices, but something to augment them. This is my personal opinion anyways, but I really do like these features.    * The Sights - I've always liked the fact that the XD and XDm series came with metal 3 dot sights. The sights are very durable, and clear, making it very easy to reacquire sight picture and perform followup shots. The XDm series seems to differ from the XD series a bit here, as the sights are pushed all the way to the back of the slide, giving XDm a slightly longer sight radius.    * Carry - During my time carrying the XDm, I noticed no difference in how the pistol felt as far as the shape, and dimensions when compared with my XD9SC. It fit perfectly in my cross-breed supertuck which was designed for the XD9SC. Retention was great, and position was spot on. The only area where the XDm felt different was weight. You can definitely tell it's a bit heavier, but overall it didn't bother me.   * Capacity - 10 rounds of .45 ACP is nothing to sneeze at in a carry gun, especially for how small this pistol is. I still prefer 9mm for the capacity gains, but I would not feel under-gunned with this pistol.   * Recoil - In recent years, my experience with .45 ACP has been with full sized 1911s, and the XDs. The 1911 makes recoil almost non-existent, and the XDs is very snappy, so this being middle ground between the two, I had no idea what to expect. Over the course of the day, I was incredibly surprised with how little recoil the XDm had. Subjectively, it feels less than my 9mm, and I felt like I was much more accurate with it than my XD9SC. **What I Don't Like:**    * Cost - The XDm series has always been expensive. Typically, I have seen them sell for anywhere between $580-650, which is quite a bit more than I could get a comparable pistol for, such as a Glock, or M&amp;P. Springfield does try to offset this a bit by giving the purchaser every thing they need to carry, or compete in IDPA right out of the box with the XD Gear, but I feel quite a few people would like to see an 'essentials' package in the XDm series, which forgoes the gear for a lower price point.    * The Trigger - One thing I cannot stand about the XD and XDm series is the trigger. It's mushy, does not break clean, and has almost no tactile or audible reset. I really wished Springfield would have addressed this issue in the XDm series, especially since they tout the advantages of their 'match grade' barrel. It's disappointing to see they didn't make the component that makes the most difference match grade. There are still Powder River Precision, and others that provide a drop in or total conversion kit, but that should not be necessary in a $600 firearm. So there we are - I really do like the XDm series. It's great carry gun, and a lot more accurate than I am, and in .45 feels fantastic compared to the Glocks that I have fired. As I said I am disappointed in the trigger, and the pricing, but both are subjective. I don't believe I would purchase the XDm in .45 for myself due the cost of ammunition for training, and capacity, but I would have to think real hard about it if I were to be offered a good deal on one. 
2ldsez	-59624	1415207691	gunreviews	[Review] [FN] FNS-9	Manufacturer: FN HerstalModel: FNS-9Caliber: 9x19mm NATO Capacity: 17+1Barrel Length: 4"Weight: 25.0oz UnloadedTriger Pull: 6.0lbs +/-MSRP: $599http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/fns_9_d-tfb.jpg - Pic taken from The Firearm Blog, because as I've mentioned before, my picture taking skills are shit. This is a bit different from my other range reports, as I liked this pistol so much that I bought it. I've been needing a second pistol for a while, and while I love my Glock 22, I like this better. I also decided caliber diversity was a good goal and switched to 9mm for this pistol. This version came with Trijicon night sights, and out the door, with a 50 round box of Winchester Ranger-T 127gr +P+, I paid $549.**What I Like:**    * Ergonomics - It's why I bought the gun. The FNS feels FANTASTIC in the hand. It comes with interchangeable backstraps, a rounded and a flat one. I immediately changed to the flat backstrap and haven't considered changing back. The best way I can describe it is it feels like a doublestack 1911, and is one of the most comfortable pistols I have ever laid hands on.      The grip stippling is very aggressive, and it makes and impression after shooting for quite a while, but it's not uncomfortable when shooting and aids greatly in control of the firearm.   * Trigger - The trigger is not the best striker-fired trigger I'ved ever used, but it's not the worst either. It's a hinged trigger, kind of like what the M&amp;P uses, but it's useless for any actual safety, as the lower portion of the hinge does not reset after it gets depressed slightly, so anything can actuate the trigger after it has been depressed the first time. There is a slight amount of take-up before a clean break, right at about 6lbs, and the reset, while not short by any means, is quite positive.     I have been told the the trigger will break in a bit better after 500 rounds, and I'm really looking forward to that.    * Reliability - Out of 350 rounds fired during my initial range trip, I had no malfunctions of any kind. The pistol ate everything fed to it, from WWB to Federal bulk for range ammo, as well as Speer Gold Dot 124gr +P, and Winchester Ranger-T +P+. The biggest surprise was that it cycled light powered 115gr reloads that were specifically loaded to JUST cycle in an MP5. It went through a good 50 of those without any hiccups as well. Overall I am very impressed with reliability, and will be doing more extensive 1-2,000 round test at a later date.    * Loaded Chamber Indicator - While not as tactile or as visible as the XD, or SR-series of pistols (The FNS uses an extractor-type indicator like the Glock), the loaded chamber indicator is still a nice feature to have. It sticks out just enough that during the night, you can definitely feel a difference, as well it has a small amount of red paint along the top of it for visual inspection.    * The Sights - Trijicon night sights, factory mounted from FN. They aren't the brightest on the market, but they seem very durable and are very clear and precise.   * Recoil / Accuracy - This is a full-sized polymer-framed pistol chambered in 9mm. Recoil is extremely minimal when using standard pressure ammunition, and does not increase in any significance when using +P or +P+ loadings. Followup shots are quick and precise, and incredibly easy. The grip stippling, angle of grip, and general design of the pistol lend itself to very quick and accurate shots.     Grouping at 10 yards was around 3-4", which for me, isn't bad. I'm not exactly the world's greatest marksman, so I was very pleased with this grouping, especially when compared to shooting a Glock or M&amp;P of the same caliber.    * Ambidextrous Controls - Every single control on the FNS is ambidextrous except for the take-down lever, which doesn't need to be. Mag release, slide-stop and manual safety. All controls are very easy to reach and easy to actuate.    * Manual Safety - Yes, I know what you're thinking. A manual safety on a striker fired gun is unnecessary, and you're right. The FNS comes both with and without a manual safety. Unfortunately the gun shop I purchased mine from did not have the ones without the safety, but I honestly don't mind it. It's not intrusive, and this is a gun I frequently carry off-body in a Maxpedition Versa-carry bag when the situations limits me from on-body carry, and I do like the added safety during those situations.**What I Don't Like:**    * Build Quality - Let me be clear here. The pistol itself, the polymer frame and slide are very robust, and built very well. My gripe however, is with the finish on the slide. It scrapes and wears very easily, and I'm not sure what this will mean for the condition of the pistol further down the line. I don't really care how it looks, but my main concern is rust somewhere down the line.     * Ambidextrous Mag Release - I both love, and dislike this mag release. It is VERY positive, and easy to actuate. This causes a bit of a problem, however. It sticks out so much that it is easily depressed by a holster or a misaligned finger. I wish that FN had sunk it a bit deeper into the frame, or made the release a flat button as opposed to a rounded one, as this would have made it better for carry. **Carry:**I have carried this pistol for about a week now, both on-body and off-body. I trust it as my daily carry, and I'm very pleased with it. Holsters are easy to find, and are standard fair when fitting and positioning.I do have a few gripes, and these are that the aggressive stippling on the grip causes a fair amount of irritation on bare skin, and that the pistol is a bit wider than other options such as the Glock, M&amp;P and XD/XDm series, and weighs a tiny bit more, but these are very minor. Overall I love this pistol, and am very happy with my purchase. It is rapidly becoming one of my favorite pistols, and if it can bring the same level of reliability and durability down the line as a Glock or XD, it will have secured a permanent place as my preferred carry gun.

This firearm is of particular interest to me due to the fact that it is almost the exact same size as a Springfield XD, which is what I currently carry when I want a small firearm.**What I Like:**    * Ergonomics - The Ultra Carry feels fantastic in the hand. It's got a very nice balance of it's weight, and feels 'just right'. I don't know if this is the right term for it, but then length of pull, between my palm and to the trigger feels very nice, and my finger sat perfectly on the trigger. This is a bit different from some striker fired pistols I've had a chance to handle lately. The positioning of the safety / decocker, and the slide lock do seem a bit bunched up and awkwardly spaced, but that can't be helped on a pistol this small.    * Reliability - I really didn't know what to expect here. Bersa as a company is really beginning to gain my appreciation due to their recent products and the quality of them, and I had high hopes for this pistol in this category.      We put a total of 300 rounds through the Ultra Carry. A mix of FMJ and JHP. The first magazine through the gun had 2 failures to eject using Federal 115gr FMJ. After this magazine, however, we had no issues with the Federal, and progressed to Hornady Critical Duty 135gr, and Federal HST 124gr +P. Both loads cycled well, and had no issues.   * Capacity - 13+1 rounds of 9mm is very respectable in a firearm of this size. You could still do a bit better in this form factor if you went with a Glock, or a bit worse on capacity if you chose a Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P9C. 1 or 2 rounds isn't much of a difference, and it all comes down to what your personal preference in firearms is, but this budget minded Bersa can still keep pace with the more well known competitors in this category.     * Recoil - It's a 9mm, so light recoil is to be expected. Recoil in the Ultra Carry is very manageable and seems to be a bit less snappy in comparison to my XD, or even a Glock 26.   * The Trigger - The trigger is very nice in double-action mode. Pull is long, but smooth and predictable.    * Rail - Plain and simple, it has a rail for mounting small lights, or, if it's your thing - lasers. **What I Don't Like:**    * Safety / Decocker - The Ultra Carry has an ambidextrous safety / decocker mounted on the frame. I understand the need for a safety on a DA/SA firearm, but I dislike the decocker. You can carry this firearm with the safety on, but not with the hammer cocked. This is a minor annoyance, but one that has stuck with me during my time with it.    * The Trigger - The trigger in single action feels a bit weird. It might be that I'm just used to single action revolver triggers, but the Ultra Carry's trigger in single action still what seemed to be a long amount of travel before it dropped the hammer. The resistance was a lot less than double action, but I usually anticipate very little or no travel on a single action trigger.   * Carry - While the Ultra Carry is lighter than the XD that I am used to carrying, it's also wider. This definitely noticeable in an IWB holster.  As someone who likes Bersa products quite a bit, I am conflicted on this one. Personally, if I were going to buy a new carry firearm, I would stick with either a Glock 19, or a S&amp;W M&amp;P9c, but this is mostly due to the fact that I like striker-fired polymer pistols more than hammer fired alloy/steel ones. I believe that if you DO want something hammer-fired then this should be a strong contender if you're on a budget, but overall I didn't like this one very much.

Not sure if this is correct for every device, but since at least last week, I now have 1080 and 1440p options on the Youtube application, as well as all of my family members.I've checked it on 2 HTC One M8's, and a Note 4, and it seems like the new higher resolution options are actually doing something. Here's to hoping that they will eventually incorporate 60fps modes, as well as higher bit rate.

I did anoms and other bullshit as well as a few fleet ops, and then got bored. I quit EVE for about a year, and lo and behold, the corp I was with apparently pissed off their biggest ally, and then got their shit pushed in during the ensuing sov battles. If you can't tell, I'm talking about TEST. The station where I had made camp is now held by a different corp. When I logged in, my jump clone at Jita was what was activated and I now don't really know how to get my 1-2B ISK worth of stuff out of the station. I've put in a ticket to the GMs, but that's gone unanswered for about a week now, so I'm not sure what to do. Any ideas? Will the GMs even move a players stuff for a situation like this?

I propose the Olympia Convention- the military and political authorities from across the land have yet to establish international standards of warfare, and this situation might be ameliorated through a meeting in the capitol building of Olympia. I would recommend October 11th, 7:00 PM EST as the appointed time.We must define the wartime rights of prisoners (civil, military). The world as a whole has yet to establish protections for civilians; the protections afforded to non-combatants must be standardized and enforced, in or around war zones.A few questions that this treaty must answer:Is it permissible to pearl enemy soldiers indefinitely?What tactics are permissible? For example, is releasing convicted criminals from an enemy's vault permissible?Are railways a viable target, even if the railway is connected to a neutral town?What standards must be upheld in a military court/tribunal?What constitutes a war crime?How do we treat a defeated foe?How will we respond to those who violate international law?Is it necessary to establish an international organization that will determine who has violated international law? Where would that organization be situated?
2iq0wg	-59627	1412821087	Olympia_Court	Ministerial Decree Regarding Court Processions and the Olympian Justice System	As it is within the purview of my authority, I am hereby decreeing a preliminary set of articles enumerating the rights of citizens and the limits within which the Ministry of Defence must dispense justice.Article I: The Rights of Citizens  Citizens have the right to remain silent. Citizens have the right to speak freely, but threats towards Olympian citizens are considered assault.  No citizen or individual may be tried twice for the same crime regarding the same instance- double jeopardy is forbidden. This guarantee does not prohibit the court from trying separate cases of the same type of crime.  A criminal may appeal to have his or her case considered in terms of judicial interpretation; in essence, this grants a criminal found guilty a chance to dispute the constitutional basis for a law. The determination of the constitutional basis for a law shall be considered by 3 officials: the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defence, and a final minister selected randomly by the acting judge; such a committee will be referred to as a Constitutional Assembly. If a minister is unable to convene, the acting judge will appoint an available member.  No citizen may have their citizenship revoked without a trial, though the rights of citizenship may be curtailed in times of insurrection or war;  This law refers to the revocation of citizenship due to criminal offenses, revocation due to extended inactivity is permissible without a trial.  Citizens may not be held indefinitely in times of crisis- within seven days an offender must be released or charged with a crime. If they are charged, they may be held for an additional three days before the trial commences officially.  All citizens have the right to a trial that is as brief as may be provided by the Ministry of Defence (or acting judiciary).  No Olympian citizen may have their home searched without a written warrant approved by either the Minister of Defence or both the Prime Minister and any other Minister (People, Economy, etc.).  Citizens may not be arrested (pearled) on the basis of suspicion, though if the court deems it necessary an offender deemed a flight-risk may be held before and during a trial. Article II: The Justice System  Evidence obtained through an unwarranted search of an Olympian's home is inadmissible in court.   All crimes occurring within the confines of Olympian territory are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defence.   The guilt or innocence of an offender shall not be determined as a whole- each crime shall be considered individually. The court is not obligated to provide separate hearings or threads if there is multiple charges, but each charge must be considered on its own merit.   nterference in court proceedings which is not warranted by a Constitutional Assembly is considered a treasonous act- an offender who is reasonably suspected of a capital offense against Olympia may be held for a period up to but not exceeding twenty days prior to the initiation of a trial.  Speculation and other potentially deceptive verbal arguments are permitted for the sake of argument; a mature judge should be able to discern mere speculation from fact.   Laws may not be applied retroactively. An Olympian citizen may not be prosecuted on the basis of an act that was performed prior to the establishment of legislation forbidding the citizen's actions.

His original offense was merely harassment; I was told this by a citizen of Olympia, who had somehow trapped him in our factory area (which I thought was a bit foolish.) The harassment of the citizen included placing dirt on the rails and smashing his cart. After I put on full diamond with a sword/bow (no potions sadly) I went to the factory vault, and I was not surprised to find he had broken out of the weak point (but he didn't destroy the factories). He logged in a few feet away as I was talking- had he been inside the factory and not broken out of it I would not have attempted to pearl him; my original plan was to talk to him about an apology and possible restitution. Because he had broken out, I decided I was going to pearl him and see that he went to trial for the more severe offense of breaking out of the area he was contained in. At the least, he was going to serve a day for harassment and pay to repair whatever he had broken.He pearled me instead, hence this post.He's welcome to deny as much of this as he wants, I have evidence but I will not post more of it unless he denies his guilt; I'm completely willing to let him incriminate himself by denying an act I have evidence for (i.e. harassment). If he returns my gear, he will be sentenced to at most one week if he turns himself in voluntarily. If he is captured through a bounty and found guilty, his punishment will be much more severe.As far as my position in Olympia, I am the Minister of Defence. As of this post, adambrooks is still skulking around Olympia, for what reason I can not quite discern (likely to further harass our citizens.)I would like to reiterate that the harshness of his treatment will be proportional to the time and wealth lost by Olympia- you have it on my word that if he turns himself in he will not be imprisoned for more than a week and he will only be forced to make restitution of equal value to what he has damaged, assuming he makes a full apology for the harassment of the citizens of Olympia. http://imgur.com/99x3ePs,Rx97utMhttp://i.imgur.com/Rx97utM.pnginb4 comments about the imagesGimp wouldn't open my app data folder so I just used paint.Oh, here's the evidence Geohash wouldn't stop crying about me not posting. http://i.imgur.com/VKeIB57.png

37av26	-59627	1432623982	legaladvice	Prenups can get thrown out for being "unfair?" (Florida)	To clarify, I'm not married or even dating anyone, but I am interested in how to prevent myself from getting financially ruined in the event of a divorce. My concern was prompted by a quote from this [article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stann-givens/when-a-prenup-gets-thrown_b_5542093.html):"A divorce judge will first look at whether the prenuptial agreement is unfair as compared to what the court would do without the agreement. For example, has one of the spouses given up property or alimony rights that would have been available during a divorce without the existence of a prenuptial agreement? If there is a significant difference in what the court would do with and without the existence of the agreement, then the court can determine that the agreement is unfair."An [article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2013/04/02/five-reasons-your-prenup-might-be-invalid/) in Forbes also said that a prenuptial agreement can be thrown out because it's "lopsided." From my perspective as a man, the only point of a damned prenuptial agreement is that there is SUPPOSED to be a "significant difference in what the court would do with and without the existence of the agreement." If there wasn't going to be a significant difference, why would I even bother making the agreement?If I was going to get married I'd like to have alimony out of the question and clearly limit the amount of child support I'd be liable for. But apparently asking my potential wife to agree not to come after me for alimony is unfair? Although I would like to have children, due to the way divorce courts treat men, I don't think I ever will be married. Also, "common law marriage in Florida no longer exists as an option for cohabiting couples," does that mean I can't get sued for alimony if I broke up with my girlfriend of 10 years? Obviously I'd be on the hook for child support if we had any kids. I refuse to put myself in a position where I am liable to pay a woman I despise a bunch of money. How do I avoid this? Please don't tell me "marry the right girl" or whatever, I want to avoid a worst case scenario.

lgetb	-59631	1318954950	TrueFilm	Are heroic narratives about labor critical of capitalism?	I read [this article](http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/the-work-ethic-of-breaking-bad-20110808) about Breaking Bad and its place among recent television series that appear to be about people trying to do their jobs well. The author proposes that shows like Mad Men and Friday Night Lights are about men struggling with two opposing forces: being good, and being good at their jobs. These series contrast with more popular American procedurals like Law &amp; Order, where the hero's job is a noble duty. You would think that this difference would imply a criticism of capitalism's alienation of labor, but for the most part these heroic characters are bosses and managers. The labor they're being alienated from is the exploitation of workers. So what is really going on with these shows? Mad Men makes a lot of subtle and not-so-subtle references to Ayn Rand, who had a particular attitude toward labor and achievement within capitalism. The show doesn't seem to bear her out, though. Rather than tying life choices to consequences, the show constantly pulls down characters who attempt to take their destinies into their own hands. Draper's reward for starting his own company is anxiety, alcoholism, a ruined marriage, a miserable daughter, financial instability and loneliness. There are people who are successful based on nepotism and politics, but those people are just as likely to be good at their jobs as the hard-working poor people like Draper and Peggy Olson. If there is a message in the show, it's that everyone is a scam artist one way or another, and [the Spectacle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Society_of_the_Spectacle) (as Draper understands it) is just a big version of the thing every person has to do just to get by. Is that a Nietzschean justification of shitty behavior, or a Marxist/Situationist criticism of capitalism?I thought it would be useful to compare these shows to the kind of films about labor that were produced by communist regimes in the 20th century: mid-century Chinese kitchen sink melodramas about women trying to balance work and family life, or Soviet montage films about the noble collective farmer and his wonderful cream separator. Unfortunately, there's little in terms of existential crisis going on in these films. Chinese housewives, like their American counterparts in the films of Douglas Sirk and Michael Curtiz, struggle with *getting* what they want, but not with *knowing* what they want. Soviet dairy farmers aren't even afforded the heroic subject position for the most part, as these films employ the "collective protagonist" approach Eisenstein used in Potemkin. Tarkovsky's films, produced under the Soviet regime in the 70s, could possibly give us a model for anti-capitalist existentialism (which would be backed up by Tarkovsky's own writings about the negative impact of capitalism on the soul), but none of his movies really deal with labor as such. Andrei Rublev could be said to be about a painter who struggles with the question of why he paints, but his struggle isn't with the art market or patronage. His battle is with the validity of achievement in the first place, and his relationship with God in a world full of suffering. As adventurous as Tarkovsky is, even his movies that appear to be about the absence of God (Stalker, The Sacrifice, possibly others) still come from the perspective of characters wrestling with their souls. A show like Friday Night Lights, on the other hand, makes spirituality look like a kind of sad consolation prize for people who aren't in control of their own destinies. The job here is football, and the church (and everything else) is in service to that. People care so much about doing a good job that football becomes a receptacle for the feelings of disappointment, helplessness and fear that comes with living in the middle of a literal and spiritual desert (Texas, America, the immanent universe, et al). Matt Saracen is much like Andrei Rublev; the world in which he lives is torn apart by violence and tragedy, and the only things that don't strike him as absurd are art...and football.And love, of course. One thing that Breaking Bad, Friday Night Lights, Mad Men, the Wire and Deadwood have in common is that people love each other. These shows are bleak portrayals of the working week, but all of them offer love as a shelter from existential crisis. No one ever wonders whether they should love. They just do it, the way that cops in action movies don't question whether they're part of a destructive apparatus for keeping capitalism afloat. In fact, any criticism of capitalism present in these shows would probably be rooted in their presentation of a dialectic between jobs and love; that is, between duty to a position in society and duty to a position in a family. The social construction of these motivations is not questioned. Few would likely stomach these shows if they did criticize romantic love. Mad Men, which has the darkest view of romantic entanglements, still puts forth Draper's love for his daughter and his sham ex-wife as possibly redemptive. Is that attachment to the narrative of love the flaw in the critical potential for these series? Christian Marxism would say the opposite: loving people is why we're critical of capitalism in the first place. So then are these series just insufficiently inclusive of radical ideology? The Wire doesn't exclude much in terms of pessimistic attitudes toward systems of power. The police can't do their job, the teachers can't do their job, the union workers and the journalists and the drug dealers and the lawyers can't do their job. You can't get much bleaker than a world where murderous thieves are tragic heroes and the biggest villains (the politicians) never face any justice at all. But is the Wire like Dilbert, in that the criticism is de-fanged by a playful and hypocritical nihilism? The Baltimore of the Wire is like Sisyphus' boulder, but like the old joke says, at least Sisyphus had job security. Is doing your job pointless because it serves a system of power and not you, or is it pointless because the world is bad and endeavor is hopeless?I think there's a limit to the degree any of these shows can really criticize capitalism without depicting characters actually struggling with capitalism as an idea. Marxist filmmakers like Bunuel, Pasolini and Godard draw explicit links between the suffering of workers and the systems in which they are trapped. Of the shows I mentioned, Deadwood feels the most like a descendant of an explicitly critical Marxist tradition. David Milch won't let anyone be a "hero." Everyone is either exploiting someone, hurting someone or a victim of someone else. Love means less here than in any of the other shows, possibly because the warping effect of capitalism on the "frontier" means that no one can afford to look after anyone else while they're looking out for themselves. No one loves anyone enough to choose not to sacrifice them when the time comes. There are no Marxist Christ figures in Deadwood. That may be why Milch's follow-up project was a mystical Marxist-Christian surfing series (John from Cincinnati). This is stuff I was thinking about this morning. I'd love to know what you all think.
lr5iz	-59631	1319735796	TrueFilm	On deception in films	Film theorists have written [a lot](http://www.cineaste.com/articles/emf-is-for-phony-fake-documentary-and-truths-undoingem) about the issue of whether you can "trust" a film. Movies have a complicated relationship with the truth, and the ones that seem to have the most at stake on the subject (documentaries and explicitly political work) are the ones with the most vividly constructed biases. My question relates to film acting: is an actor who gives a "good" performance (whatever that is) lying or telling the truth? Or neither? What is the relationship between film acting and lying?Strasberg and the adherents of Method acting work under the idea that film performance, like theatrical performance, is related to human behavior and human psychology. An actor who understands enough of the circumstances of a character's life is able to employ certain strategies (sense memory, animal exercises, improvisation, etc) to create a performance that is as close to "reality" as it would be if you were documenting the actual event occurring. If the inner life of the character matches, then the outer behavior will match as well (the thinking goes). But actors aren't really doing the things their characters do. If a performer is able to achieve a kind of self-hypnosis that makes it possible for real emotions to express themselves in behavior, that's still a vivid and convincing lie. Then there are films like Borat, where we are really seeing people emotionally react to the situations they're in. The situations are artificial, and reveal little except how people behave in bizarre situations. But is a film like Borat less of a lie, even though it explicitly involves people lying to each other? Film is a record of the events that occur in front of the lens, and is made up of the experience you have as you watch images play out in front of you. In that way, it's possible that illusions occur, but film itself is as real as anything is. Should the issue of truth even come up? Does truth exist in any meaningful way within cinema?
lwf18	-59631	1320156342	TrueFilm	How do you talk about films?	I'd like to know how you decide what to talk about when you talk about a movie. When I watch a movie, I have a few different experiences at the same time: * I am emotionally wrapped up in the narrative and the feelings of the characters.* I am thinking about the process of making the film (writing, shooting, acting, editing, etc) and the choices that were made.* I am thinking about all the previous films that are similar or dissimilar, or unrelated.* I am thinking about the politics of representation, of language, of commerce, of sex, of history, etc.* I am thinking about the feelings that I have when I watch the movie and what they say about me as a person, and whether other people have similar experiences or if I'm missing out on something (or they are). * I am thinking about whether I like watching the film.When I talk about movies, I generally try to synthesize all this stuff using the things I've learned from watching movies my whole life, and reading books and making movies and what have you. But then I read film reviews or forum posts and it seems that everyone else just thinks about whether they liked the movie and I'm accused of worrying too much. This happened to me recently when I saw Tree of Life. I enjoyed it, but there were a million other things in my head as well. I mentioned to a friend that I had a problem with the gender politics (woman as sign, alienated from the subject position, reinforcing regressive heteronormative relations) and he said that I had been "fucked up by film school."In certain situations, it's easier to talk to people about the *other stuff* in movies. Triumph of the Will, for example, is a pretty, well-made film that is morally horrifying. It's easy to draw a distinction between "I enjoyed it" and "those people should burn in hell," even if you experience both of those things when you watch it. What's tough is when the film is marketed as mainstream entertainment, and the person you're talking to is convinced that taking it too seriously is a waste of time. The problem I have is that people tell me I'm taking things too seriously, and they say it so often that I'm starting to think they're right. Is film really as irrelevant as that? Is there a right way to talk about movies and a wrong way?

I set up my WRT160Nv3 as a wireless repeater bridge for my apartment's wifi network (using DDWRT). Everything worked fine.UNTIL I tried to connect to the wireless network with my Wii. The Wii doesn't allow for the use of TKIP in a WPA2 encryption. So I switched to AES on both the primary router and the repeater.Now the repeater doesn't connect to the primary router anymore. Is there something simple I didn't do when I switched the two wireless routers (primary and repeater) over from TKIP to AES?EDIT: I switched both routers to WPA with TKIP (because the Wii accepts that config as well) and now it works. Any idea why AES would be giving me a problem here?

n2i45	-59631	1323180861	skyrim	Skyrim and the aesthetics of landscape painting	&gt;"Landscape painting is the thoughtful and passionate representation of the physical conditions appointed for human existence. It imitates the aspects, and records the phenomena, of the visible things which are dangerous or beneficial to men; and displays the human methods of dealing with these, and of enjoying them or suffering from them, which are either exemplary or deserving of sympathetic contemplation."- John Ruskin, "[Lectures on Landscape](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20019/20019-h/20019-h.htm)," 1871I think we're starting to see screenshots from Skyrim that are a little more ambitious than the usual "check out this cool thing that happened" screenshots that you see from every game forum.&gt;"We are surrounded with things which we have not made and which have a life and structure different from our own: trees, flowers, grasses, rivers, hills, clouds. For centuries they have inspired us with curiosity and awe. They have been objects of delight. We have recreated them in our imaginations to reflect our moods. And we have come to think of them as contributing to an idea which we have called nature. Landscape painting marks the stages in our conception of nature. Its rise and development since the Middle Ages is part of a cycle in which the human spirit attempted once more to create a harmony with its environment."- Kenneth Clark, "[Landscape into Art](http://art-landscape.blogspot.com/2010/01/landscape-into-art-by-kenneth-clark.html)," 1949It's possible that the desire to represent the landscapes of Skyrim in screenshots that are deliberately composed (rather than hastily snagged) reveals something about the way we play the game. As Clark and Ruskin said, landscapes only matter to us if they have an effect on our lives: the way we live in them, the threats and benefits they offer, the symbols that we impose upon them.My point (and I do have one) is that Bethesda has apparently produced a pretty successful simulator of human aesthetic experience. Successful enough, anyway, to generate the same (or similar) feelings in gamers that actual landscapes stimulate in people who experience them. The fact that we're sharing these landscapes with each other and appreciating them outside of the specific narrative context of the adventures within the game is proof of that much.

Is there a store in New York that sells a variety of low-end foreign candies?EDIT: I spoke to someone at Simply Gourmand, and someone else at French Feast, and while they only offer by-mail service, they were able to direct me to a French market on 63rd and 1st Ave (and one at 77th and York) that sells what I'm looking for.

I was reading this interview with [Bill Walsh](http://www.sportsxchange.com/ds97/walsh/walsh4.htm) and he mentions that he likes QBs who avoid interceptions. That's probably a good quality in a QB, but how exactly do they do it? I imagine all QBs *want* to avoid interceptions, but some are much better than others. It seems different from releasing the ball quickly, reading the defense, etc. How do you teach someone not to throw interceptions?

tb9tk	-59631	1336404759	rpg	Rolling dice as a surrogate for an editor	I have only been playing tabletop rpgs for about six months, but I've noticed something that I hope you'll be able to clear up. I apologize if this is an old topic that has been sufficiently discussed. As a DM, I am often in the position of rolling dice to determine the outcome of a situation. In my role as storyteller, it occurs to me that what I think will be best for the story and what the dice do will sometimes conflict. Is the benefit of rolling (a sense of a complex world simulated by combining randomness with pre-determined variables) always better than good writing? If there is a relationship between improvisational theatre and these games, does it not follow that any outcome is justifiable? If that is the case, aren't the players better served by a DM with a creative scheme than one with numerous charts and maps? Is the entire array of mechanics just a stand-in for good writing?

I'm editing a short video in FCP X, using footage that was shot on the T2i with the Magic Lantern "Christmas update" firmware. The footage was shot as 24 fps alternating-frame HDR, with the A frames exposed three stops lower than the B frames. I have a plugin for FCP X that allows me to combine the frames into a 12 fps video.My question has to do with one particular shot. All of the footage was shot on a tripod, so that the border between the highlights and the shadows wouldn't jump around as the camera moved - except for one two-minute tracking shot. That one is a little shaky, and could use the stabilization effect in FCP X. Unfortunately, the way this HDR plugin works, I have to replace the footage on the timeline with a "generated" clip (like the gradients and solid colors in the "generator" menu) and drop the original footage into a window inside that clip's "generator" panel. Since the clip on the timeline isn't video footage, but instead is a "generated" clip, is it possible to use the stabilizing effect, or do I need to export the project and re-import as video footage?

urs77	-59631	1339173632	rpg	Please help with clueless party.	I'm having a problem with the group I'm DMing. I would really appreciate your help.I'm running a D&amp;D 3.5 campaign with between six and eight players (depending on the week). They're investigating a number of narrative threads on a tropical island, including a hidden moon-worshiping temple, a racially-motivated peasant revolt against the island's colonists, a murderous crime boss, the port being closed by the ever-burning wreckage of the ship they arrived on, et al. The party seems completely lost as to what to do. They wander from one part of the island to another, occasionally running into encounters and figuring out tiny pieces of the bigger puzzle. Whenever they're presented with a problem (a curse that will go off in 48 hours, kidnapped party members, etc) they argue with each other, then either 1) ignore the problem until it bites them in the ass or 2) attempt a half-baked plan that usually ends worse than the problem they were trying to solve.They seem to have no ability to figure out what to do, no matter how many clues I give them. Aside from bringing in some deus ex machina to lead them by the nose to the solution, I don't know how to help the party without completely neutering the threats I've already established in the setting.BTW, these players are all college-educated, employed adults who asked me to DM for them because they haven't played D&amp;D before. Should I just whisk them away to an easier situation? Princess in a tower guarded by a troll, that sort of thing?EDIT: Thank you so much, everyone. There's so much great advice here. I'll make another edit tomorrow after I incorporate some of these suggestions.EDIT EDIT: Last night I had the religious studies professor at the local university tell the party some background on the plot. The party jumped on it, found the pirate ship, cured their curse, killed the witch in the swamp and started to pursue the rest of the plot. They did all of it in about four hours. It was a hoot and everyone got to do the things they like to do: the ninja snuck up on the witch by slowly creeping through the swamp water, the ranger/chef found berries in the jungle to make a pie to trade for the potion to kill the witch, the drag queen cleric disguised herself as an Orc child to trick the witch, the monk detective humiliated the corrupt priest and the bard/travel writer rode a celestial dolphin through the swamp. A little bit of direction went a long way.

I understand the primary advantages of the mirrorless system (smaller, sturdier, cheaper than DSLRs while keeping a large sensor). From what I've seen of the new lenses designed for these cameras, there doesn't seem to be practical advantage from an optical point of view. With the mirror removed, shouldn't it be easier to make excellent fast wide angle lenses? I don't see many wide primes for APS-C mirrorless cameras that are significantly faster than the ones currently available for Nikon and Canon APS-C DSLRs. The one exception is the Fuji 18mm f/2, which is a stop faster than what's currently available for DSLRs in that focal length.

Barnes and Noble stock has been rising since the CEO resigned yesterday. http://www.nasdaq.com/article/barnes--noble-inc-bks-is-rising-after-ceos-resignation-20130709-00556Is it really possible for Barnes and Noble to have a future? They own a bunch of physical stores that sell things people get easily over the internet (like Blockbuster), they tried and failed to compete in the tablet market (like BlackBerry), their website is a copy of Amazon without the great selection or low prices, and their biggest cultural footprint is convincing Meg Ryan to hate Tom Hanks.On the other hand, Barnes and Noble stores are generally pleasant places to spend time in. In the suburbs, they're as close to a functional public space as most small towns get. They still sell a lot of coffee and pound cake. At Christmas, the one in my tiny hometown is a madhouse. People do still purchase and read physical books, and nearly all of the competition (Borders, Waldenbooks, Crown) have gone out of business. What's left is Books-A-Million, which has all the charm and customer service of the warehouse where they lay out the remains of the luggage after an airplane crash.Is this resignation really a step in the right direction, or is Barnes and Noble a lost cause?

Camera lenses have such good resale value that most photographers have bought a used lens at some point, and many shoot with only used lenses. That means there's an enormous community of people on ebay buying and selling used camera lenses.These lenses are expensive, and a lot of photographers and videographers own their own businesses, so the buyers put a lot of thought into their bidding practices on ebay. They do price research, wait to bid, then snipe, like a well-informed customer would. It's not uncommon to see a good lens at a low price sit in a seven-day auction with no bids and two dozen watchers, then sell at a very high price after a 45-second bidding war at the end of the auction.Occasionally, however, a particular lens or piece of camera equipment will have a lot of bidders right at the beginning. This happens most often with items that have a value outside of the professional world. That is to say, you're more likely to see non-snipe bidding wars on items that are being pursued by amateurs and students. I believe, based on looking at completed auctions, that this actually drives the price of these items **down** because it discourages professionals from watching and then bidding on the items. The professionals see this early bidding, imagine that some wealthy amateur is going to drive the price on the item up, and the professionals decide to wait and bid on the next one.If you are bidding on an item that has an appeal primarily to budget-conscious professionals who buy a lot of used equipment, does it make sense to place several bids early on, to create the illusion of irrational amateurs driving up the price? Will this result in fewer bidders, and therefore a lower final auction price?

I updated the BIOS using the most recent version on the MSI support page. I chose optimized defaults and made sure the USB stick would boot first. I booted from the USB (prepared as a Mavericks installer with Unibeast) and got to the Apple logo with the spinning circle. After that, it went to a light grey screen, then a dark grey screen, then stuck there. I read about the "grey screen of death" that people have encountered, and discovered that there was no evidence that Galaxy video cards worked at all with Mavericks. I removed the card and tried to start again with the display connected to the integrated VGA output on the motherboard, but now it gets to the Apple logo with the spinning circle and freezes before even getting to the grey screens. I tried as many configurations of boot flags as I could find on tonymacx86, but nothing seemed to help. I can't get to the installer and I'm not sure what to do. I would appreciate some help. I would have tried this initially with Mountain Lion, but the Mountain Lion installer is no longer available through the App Store and I don't know how to get it otherwise. I'm running Mountain Lion on my current MacBook, but I can't figure out how to create a Mountain Lion installer USB without access to the App Store installer.

1ywsrn	-59631	1393352330	MyTheoryIs	On the role of selfishness in narrative	There are a few different popular theories about how and why people tell stories to each other. Most of these theories ([Aristotle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharsis), [Freud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wit_and_Its_Relation_to_the_Unconscious), [Kristeva](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjection), [Bergson](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4352/4352-h/4352-h.htm), [Mulvey](https://wiki.brown.edu/confluence/display/MarkTribe/Visual+Pleasure+and+Narrative+Cinema), et al) focus on the emotional or psychic motivations people have for experiencing certain things. It's a piecemeal model that offers an explanation for why people like stories, but not for why people *tell* stories. [Rudolph Arnheim](http://www.aakkozzll.com/pdf/arnheim.pdf) says that artists and art consumers share the same motivation - the motivation that philosophers and scientists also share - that there are complicated systems in place which are poorly understood, and no smart person with sufficient means can [resist a mystery](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0708688/). This ignores entirely the psychological theories regarding narrative, and directly contradicts Mulvey and Lacan. Below is my attempt to synthesize the theorists mentioned above, while also incorporating [Deleuze](http://www.amazon.com/What-Is-Philosophy-Gilles-Deleuze/dp/0231079893), [Grosz](http://projectlamar.com/media/groszchaos.pdf) and [Ranciere](http://www.versobooks.com/books/1425-aisthesis).The experience of the world is **confusing**, **terrifying** and **lonely**.In order to handle this experience, and transform it into something meaningful and optimistic, people create for themselves a story of their world. The story is like the stories we tell each other; it is made up of scenes, characters, settings, backstories, dialog, etc. By writing this story, we can draw connections between otherwise-random inputs and create testable theories about the future. This fights **confusion**. The story also allows us to assign values to certain objects, people and events, which provide us with motivation that can withstand the persistent examination of the relentless human analytical mind. This fights **terror**. The dialectic interaction between these two systems ("What is my world?" and "What do I want?") is what generates emotional reaction to stories (and I will go into that later on). We have several reasons for sharing our stories with each other, but the primary motivator is **loneliness**. By sharing experience-theories with each other, we break down the emotional barriers that prevent us from imagining that others share our values. Our values are tied directly to our sense of mortality and self. By sharing these values with others, we are able to feel connected to others, which has [real physical benefits](http://www.amazon.com/Loneliness-Human-Nature-Social-Connection/dp/0393335283) and prevents the creeping nihilism of the self/other dicotomy. By incorporating others into your personal "self," the individual builds a desire to improve the conditions of others, which results in the strengthening of social systems of order that improve the lives of people living in communities.People tell different kinds of stories.The kinds of stories people tell are categorized (in this model) by how they represent the world, and what that representation means in terms of the two systems I mentioned above - "What is my world?" and "What do I want?" The question "**What is my world?**" creates a split between two answers: these are the things in my world, and these are the things that are not in my world. Generally speaking, certain phenomena are incorporated into your personal model of existence, and certain phenomena are excluded. From a Freudian perspective, those things that are *not* part of our existence are **sex** and **death.** Sex can only exist as a **fantasy**, because the reality of sex is ridiculous (bodies slapping against each other, silly sex talk, etc). Death has a similar relationship to our realities, as we must build elaborate models of existence with the goal of making death either [irrelevant](http://www.nyu.edu/classes/keefer/hell/camus.html) or [nonexistent](http://www.rjgeib.com/thoughts/proud/). Thus we see that there are the things outside of our experience that we desire (sex, or the fetishized) and that we abhor (death, or the abject).Those things that *are* part of our model of existence fit into the same two categories: that which we desire (a good world, or "**justice**") and that which we abhor (the world as it is that we can neither ignore nor accept - the "**comical**"). Aristotle's concepts of narrative, as explained in the *Poetics*, apply only to the first category. The world created in an Aristotelian narrative is an example of Platonic "[divine eros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_eros#Platonic_eros)." This is the world as we would like it to be, and as we want to imagine it is. A world where justice, charity, honor, etc, are realities. A world where parents love their children. A world where rulers serve their subjects. A world where criminals are punished. A world with a benevolent God. A world without death. The use of stories to imagine this world is described in an unattributed [ancient Greek text](http://people.wku.edu/jan.garrett/302/critias.htm):&gt; I think,     Some shrewd man first, a man in judgment wise,    Found for mortals the fear of gods,    Thereby to frighten the wicked should they 15 Even act or speak or scheme in secret.    Hence it was that he introduced the divine     Telling how the divinity enjoys endless life,    Hears and sees, and takes thought    And attends to things, and his nature is divine,20 So that everything which mortals say is heard    And everything done is visible.     Even if you plan in silence some evil deed    It will not be hidden from the gods: for discernment    Lies in them. Those things which we know to be true, but cannot bear, stir in us the [urge to laugh](http://essays.quotidiana.org/montaigne/that_we_laugh_and_cry_for_the/). Without the humor response, awful things such as humiliation, the mechanical natures of humanity, injustice, selfishness, stupidity, laziness, cowardice, cynicism, cruelty, mediocrity - those things of which we are all guilty, at each moment of our lives - would drown us. Humor reassures us that, yes, we are awful, but that is not all we are. The fact of being able to share humor with each other means that these things can be considered and then defeated.Therefore we can build a grid which can chart how any particular story interacts with our values and our experiences.Justice | Titillation________________Humor   | HorrorAs a particular experience is outlined with details - as a story is told - it moves around in the cartesian plane described above. When the story depicts a world that is like your world, it wanders around on the left side of the graph (drama and comedy). When the story veers into that which cannot be incorporated (porn and horror), it moves to the right. Similarly, when a story appears to fit into your system of values, it moves across the top half of the graph. When it moves outside of your values, it stays in the bottom half. We can even see what happens when something sits in an indeterminate location.* Something halfway between sex and drama is both titillating and stirring, sometimes at the same time. This is how women have been traditionally narratively marginalized in Hollywood cinema. They're both alluring and pristine. This is why so much of Hollywood cinema in the 20th century seemed to be both chaste and seductive - lots of sex under the surface, but none onscreen.* Halfway between comedy and drama is the emotionally ensnaring comedy. Those aspects of life which we know to be true about ourselves, but which we know to be awful, are shown to us and then redeemed. Christmas movies are a good example. People are careless, selfish gluttons, but they show their love for each other when it really counts. Also, the American version of The Office.* Dark comedies. When the awful aspects are a pit in which we wallow, which cause us to cringe and squirm in our seats. We know these things are real, we know that we are guilty, but we are given no relief. The original version of The Office.* That which alternates between sexy and scary, or sits uncomfortably between them - the works that pace around in the subconscious. The films of David Cronenberg, David Lynch, François Ozon, etc. This territory - mapped out by the stories that you tell, that you hear, that you make up for yourself - is boundless, indefinable, difficult to comprehend. [This is the attempt to map the plane of immanence.](http://projectlamar.com/media/Pure_Immanence.pdf) So much is at stake, and yet the project is completely impossible. That is why people tell and seek out stories, and always will.

Everywhere I looked, people said it was a waste of time to try to kill My Nemesis in kittycore, especially as a Pastamancer. With the Black Cat blocking half of my items and spells, there's no way the Demon wouldn't land three special attacks (each of which take off 1/3 of max HP, whatever that happens to be). But I figured it out!The Attorney's Badge! By buffing Moxie up above 220, and equipping the Attorney's Badge, I made myself almost impossible to hit with normal attacks. The 1/3 HP special attack still hits, but Spaghetti Demon won't use it if you used Entangling Noodles on the previous turn. So I loaded up on spell damage-increasing equipment and alternated Entangling Noodles and Weapon of the Pastalord, and he died!I tried all the strategies others had suggested (macrame nets, muscle buffs, etc), but after three days, this is the one that worked. What a relief to be able to move on to the next excruciating waste of time on my Black Cat run.

Janeway and Kirk's fathers were in Star fleet , making them legacies, but Picard and Sisko don't have military families. Maybe they traded wine and ratatouille for a spot at Star Fleet Academy? It's possibly also significant that Federation's executive branch headquarters are in Paris (the legislature and academy are in San Francisco), indicating that the higher-ups probably enjoy French (and French-influenced Creole) food and wine.It seemed strange to me that the Enterprise was being constructed in Iowa, until I realized that farmers probably hold an inordinate amount of influence on a society that cherishes fresh food. It also explains why so many Starfleet officers are Americans (specifically Midwestern and Southern). That's where the farms are.Other prominent characters have either a food connection or a military/political family. Spock's father and Troi's mother are ambassadors. Miles O'Brien grew up on a farm. Dax had previously been an ambassador. Nearly everyone else on the various show had at least one parent who served in Star Fleet.You might say, "farming and food prep make up the entire private sector, of course everyone's either a farmer or an astronaut." But the idea of the post-scarcity economy is that everything you need is free, so there's no motivation to work...unless you want something that's still scarce- like a spot at the Academy. There's some kind of crypto-oligarchy in place in the federation where political and military dynasties trade favors with farmers and everyone else sits on the outside watching. Which makes it nearly identical to the economy of Ancient Rome.

He had the genes that allowed the main characters to survive the virus. Alternatively, they might have had the same biological mother, who sold her eggs. In either case, they're all blood relatives.

3bkagq	-59631	1435616973	FanTheories	Seymour Skinner's identity was revealed because of the end of the Cold War	(This is amended and reposted from my comment on the [AV Club's review](http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/simpsons-classic-principal-and-pauper-221473) of "The Principal and the Pauper")Reposted Lt. Broccoli Comments posted: &gt; One must ask oneself, who was it that got Homer interested in the Student Exchange Program. Skinner stated that he knew that the student coming in would be from Albania. I believe he personally decided that Homer, working in the nuclear plant, would be ideal as a parent of the little communist. One must also consider that Skinner spent time in Vietnam, where I believe he spent time in a POW camp. Re-education could have taken place there. Or, it is entirely possible that Armen was a communist "sleeper" from the start, and the story he told of being a young ruffian was entirely fabrication. He actually spent his early life in a hostile nation being trained by an intelligence service to infiltrate the United States. It is a matter of debate whether he was trained by the KGB, Stazi, or Albanian security.During the period when Tamzarian would have been operating in Vietnam, the Albanian security agency Sigurimi was allied with China, conducting operations in Europe and Asia. The agency continued to use agents to subvert enemy activities internationally until 1992, when it was disbanded (and reorganized as SHIK) following the end of the Communist regime in Albania. In April 1997 (five months before this episode aired), the Albanian prime minister temporarily suspending the agency's activitys pending a restructuring into a new agency [SHISH] with the assistance of the American CIA (which occurred immediately after the episode aired). (See "Encyclopedia of Intelligence and Counterintelligence" by Rodney Carlisle, Routledge, 2015)It's possible that Tamzarian was left in the cold following the dissolution, reorganization and suppression of his agency, eventually needing to concoct his own ridiculous cover story when the real Skinner reappeared. It also explains why Tamzarian was able to immediately resume being Skinner, as the following month SHIK was restructured as SHISH and agency activities resumed.This would also explain why Skinner attempts to transform Bart into an internal security agent in the season three (February, 1992) episode "Separate Vocations," as the primary function of the Sigurimi was to support the Albanian police state by suppressing domestic dissent through covert action. With his own support structure collapsing, Skinner's first instinct is to assemble a network of his own operatives to gather information and protect his position.Each time there was a significant disruption in the operations of the Albanian security agency, Tamzarian had to take drastic action to protect himself until the trouble subsided and he could resume his normal operations.Furthermore, it makes sense that Skinner/Tamzarian never married, as he couldn't risk a spouse blowing his cover. And, tangentially, this explains one of the reason's the show quickly deteriorated after season 9; a principal/principle conflict in the show was Bart's attempt to undermine the authority of Skinner/Tamzarian, who (after "Principal and the Pauper") had no more authority to undermine. After the town agrees to ignore what they learned about Skinner/Tamzarian, it's clear that neither Tamzarian's sketchy identity nor his authority matter much to the town of Springfield. Bart no longer has sufficient motivation to pursue his greatest nemesis. Bart's identity as a troublemaking scofflaw is permanently hamstrung, as there is no longer a legitimate law to scoff, nor any real trouble to be made. This leaves the show to focus on less-compelling narratives related to the countless mediocre low-stakes lives of the citizens of Springfield. The tireless struggle of a suspicious child to outwit a Communist sleeper agent is over, and nothing else the show comes up with after can compare.

Hello everyone,I'm new to GW2 and have been levelling a necro (currently 15), I chose this class purely because (you guessed it) they look _badass_. But the more i'm reading about the classes I see nothing but hate for them, namely their lack of DPS in PVE and mixed feelings about PVP. I was hoping to be able to do both PVE and PVP. Do I need to think about rerolling another class? And if so which would be my best bet? (I think guardian and thief both look cool)Thanks in advance.

It's not like im  tonedeath, but most of the time I only hear how bad it sounds after i've recorded my voice. It's most obvious for me when I record myself with my phone and then listen to the result.This is me singing Supersonic by Oasis. The first verse is with monitor on vocals and the second is without.

26liwr	-59648	1401190492	ShingekiNoKyojin	Speculations about Erens dad	I think we all can agree that Erens dad knows more about the secrets of the titans than most inside the walls. But just how much has he contributed in this apocalypse? He went on a business trip the same time as the titans attacked. Something he did on that trip might have been crucial in the upcoming of the titans. It might not have been his intent, and there might be someone hiding in the shadows who used him. Of course, we don't know what that trip really was about. But I don't think that the conclusion is gonna be that Erens dad died on that trip without us gaining anything as readers. There is also the factor of the monkey titan. It would not be suprising if he was someone we already know. But I feel that Erens dads actions so far has been too "good" for him to turn out to be the evil mastermind. But of course, we don't know the monkey titans true intent. How close do you think we are in finding out the faith and truth of Erens dad? And what will it be?

375aq0	-59655	1432513601	dndnext	Temple of Time - Challenges requested!	There exists a mysterious cave/temple.  In it are a number of portals each of which lead to various challenges, such as deadly monsters, impossible gauntlets, and capturing/defending objectives.Failure of a challenge usually results in the participants being brutally murdered.  ...Then transported back in time to the moment they entered the portal!  This info should be withheld for dramatic effect the first time ;) Additionally, depending on the challenge, DM, or campaign, the portal should close for a period of time to temper brute-forcing and complete derailment of a campaign.Success results in a suitable reward.These challenges are intended to test characters' upper limits, and often will also require clever thinking and teamwork to achieve optimal results.  It also might require the players to make very particular preparations for very specific problems.  A challenge might require a few failed run-throughs in order to learn, then use that information to make further progress. Certain challenges might have certain pre-requisites, such as class, ability, level, or min/max number of participants.  A series of challenges might also be interconnected; the reward of one might be required to complete another.So I'm looking for some collaboration on some challenge ideas!  What are some super sweet, scary, difficult, but fun challenges this place could throw at adventurers?

1vfgl7	-59666	1389938958	FindAUnit	[Request][A2] Looking for a tactical realism unit.	**Why:**  I played the ACE mod a while back with a buddy of mine and I really enjoyed it. I'm not entirely familiar with what the realism play style offers (although I have played countless hours of wasteland and DayZ), but if someone shows me the ropes for a bit I think I would have a blast with it.**When:**  Since I'm going to a university, my usual playtime for a serious game is around Friday (~5p - until I decide to stop), Saturday (possibly all day), and Sunday (~2p-~8p) CST.**About Me (Timezone, age, etc):**  I live in CST, so a unit that's anywhere in North America is fine by me. If needed, I'm 21. I'm currently in another clan whose main focus is CS:GO.I'm looking for a unit that's semi-mature, medium-large active playerbase, and mainly focused on ArmA 2. I use teamspeak, vent, mumble, and heck even IRC if needed. Also, I don't mind installing mods, as long as it doesn't get too crazy (ACE w/ ACRE is fine by me).

However, in the slide down album panel, the larger version of the same album art looks blurry.However, it's not like the album art itself is low-res, because when I switch to the MiniPlayer, http://imgur.com/WarAZ8M the same album art is shown scaled up EVEN MORE, yet it appears high-res and Retina quality.I doubt it matters, but just fyi, my music is purchased through iTunes, so all the album art is coming straight from iTunes and not some external source.

3bj60u	-59677	1435599399	AppleWatch	An app for Apple Watch shower users	Hi /r/AppleWatch!So a lot of Apple Watch wearers, including Tim Cook, myself, and many of you on this subreddit, wear Apple Watch in the shower. I thought this would be a unique opportunity to create an app that takes advantage of Apple Watch's water resistance.That's why for the past few weeks, I've been developing [Shower Savvy](http://www.showersavvyapp.com), an app that lets you keep track of your water usage in the shower. With that warm, relaxing stream of water, it's all too easy to lose track of the time, and many people spend a lot longer in the shower than is really necessary. The average shower lasts 15 to 20 minutes, using about 45 gallons of water. But simply reducing your shower time by 5 minutes could save over 4000 gallons of water a year. Not everyone has access to safe, clean drinking water. By taking shorter showers, you'll not only cut down on your utility bills, but you'll also be using water responsibly. And Shower Savvy is designed to help you do all of this.Some screenshots:* http://i.imgur.com/NCQpCj9.png* http://i.imgur.com/wcG0Ji0.png* http://i.imgur.com/EwT0t2g.pngEven if you don't take your Apple Watch into the shower, you'll still be able to track your water usage with the iPhone app. The Apple Watch app just offers a much more convenient solution. Whether you track your shower times with your iPhone, Apple Watch, or both, data between devices will always stay in sync thanks to watchOS 2.Shower Savvy will be available later this year as a FREE app for iOS 9 and a native app for watchOS 2. If you're interested, you can keep up with Shower Savvy's development by [following the app's Twitter page](https://twitter.com/showersavvyapp). And if you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to comment below. Thanks for reading!Edit: If you're interested in beta testing, I'm planning to do a TestFlight release within the coming weeks. Follow [@showersavvyapp](https://twitter.com/showersavvyapp) for more details! (You'll need the iOS 9 and watchOS 2 betas).

They want £100 for the fix but i feel thats a little high for just a cap replacement? The chap said he will use a very high rated component and thats why the cost is so high. Does this sound bogus or can caps really cost that kind of money?I would like to fix it myself but i'm not really skilled with a soldering iron so i just want to know if you guys think £100 is way to much to pay.

My question is this, if the subinterfaces are on the same wire from the switch (trunked) does the router wirespeed effect throughput between these vlans. I would like to stick my servers in a separate vlan from the clients and i need to maintain high throughput to these.setup looks somthing like this:100mb client switch with 2x GB ports trunked to core switch.Core switch (all gb) trunk to 2811 for all vlans that need routing.Server switch (all gb) trunk to core switch on 2x ports.Only just started my CCENT so go easy on me.

Works perfectly fine but this set-up doesn't provide any redundancy to the links, to address this I've been toying with the idea of creating a LAG between the two sites over these Microwave links.Design would look something like this.Data and VOIP VLANS - [L3 Switch] - [LAG Trunk - [MW1/MW2 - Bridged - MW3/MW4] - LAG Trunk] - [L3 Switch] - Data and VOIP VLAN if that makes sense.So is this crazy? Would it even work? How would the connection deal with variations in speed across the two connections?

hacz8	-59711	1305265053	hiphopheads	Hip Hop: Personas vs. Reality	Following the controversy surrounding Common's White House performance, my dad, who has never been exposed to hip hop (outside of mentions on the Daily Show and the New York Times), had a big question about hip hop culture: are the personalities of artists on stage and in the media reflective of those artists' actual personalities?  I of course said no, hip hop and to a greater degree rap is made up of "personas" like how Steven Colbert isn't truly a conservative and wrestlers don't really hit each other.  But I couldn't give him any concrete examples or evidence.  50 Cent obviously doesn't sell drugs or kill people, but he definitely raps about it.  Does anyone here know of scholarly articles, or other sourced material that would explain this concept better?  When I say "scholarly" I mean written in a way understandable to those clueless about hip hop/rap's history.  Thanks guys.tl;dr: rappers aren't all actually killer misogynistic drug lords; where's the proof? 
kvyj6	-59711	1317346265	techsupport	new GFX card causing BSOD :'(	allow me to recount my tale of woe...I recently RMA'd my old Radeon HD 4890 and just received a HD 6850 in return.  I popped in my new card without cleaning the drivers first, and installed the Catalyst 11.10 beta drivers.  Upon restarting, my computer crashed just as I got to the Windows home screen, causing a BSOD (STOP: 0x00000001e).  I uninstalled the 11.10 drivers, cleaned my system using driver sweeper in safe mode, and installed the Catalyst 11.9 drivers, which were just released and are claimed to be stable.  Upon restarting normally, the same BSOD happened.  I need help beyond this point, thanks.SOLUTION: After system restoring, I checked what programs were starting up with my computer, and disabled "ATI tray tools".  Upon doing this, my computer ran fine after a restart, and I successfully updated my drivers to 11.9.  [](/solved)

That being said, I have a friend that has a business that wants to create a database for her building materials company. She wants a database to pull up what her customers have ordered. Can I make one database for all this, or should I make two of them separate? One for customers, one for her products, and then have them pull up in a nice little form when she searches for the customer name? If its the latter, how difficult would it be to pull the information from the separate databases in a PHP form with a little gooey front end for her to look at? If this is no simple task I will tell her that I simply just can't help out because I have been out of the game way too long and I suck, but if I can manage to pull my head out and get this together for her it would be great.Thanks Reddit!!

368rkk	-59716	1431846599	flashlight	Anyone here into DIY torches? I'm somewhat of an electronic hobbyist as far as DIY gadgets but flashlights are becoming my favorite thing to make.	I used to play around a lot with lighting circuits mainly oscillators sometimes referred to as a Joule Thief which is basically a crude inverter to allow a near-dead AA battery to light a 3v led bright. I have made a ton of tiny lights some of which can run 10 or so 3v leds from an AA battery for a good amount of time. But ever since the newer Leds starting coming out I've been wanting to start making some real bright torches. I want to share a little info in a long rant on some torches I have been playing with if anyone is interested. I like Cree Leds so i bought a few XML's from ebay as well as some 18650 surefires (edit 'UltraFires' i mean) I decided i would throw together some BS lights just to play around with them first and get a feel for their limits etc. I found the batteries to be decent as 3.7 li-ions go, but the advertised mAh was 6800 per battery which i don't think is the actual case.I found the Led's to be pretty amazing, in that they are rated to handle 3A... at 3v...  but I wasn't able to push anywhere near that into them. My initial test flashlight was a simple hookup, no driver circuit. The Led, a couple switches, and the battery. I figured the battery itself was not going to quite kick out 3A, or over 1.5A for that matter but quickly realized there was too much heat, and though i was really happy with the brightness, the single 18650 was not going to last longer than 5 to 10 minutes at that brightness. I decided I would run the battery through a diode, dropping the voltage down a little as sort of a crude resistor, and i ended up adding a small extra switch to bypass that as a crude hi/lo switch. The end result was a single 18650 light that on high, is not as FULL brightness, but about as bright as my 3D led maglite, and on low, will last quite some time and is still impressively bright and about equal to anything you would pay $20 for at the store. I found a $3 gas station light i could use for a housing, jammed the circuit in there, added a USB cord for charging, and wrapped that sucker in electrical tape cause i don't care what it looks like lol.. Total cost for that guy was around $5.The next 2 Cree Leds out of the pack i bought i decided i would try to push as close to their limits as i could to achieve maximum brightness.  I had about six 18650's to play with so i figured i would once again bypass a driving circuit and get straight to the point putting three batteries in parallel and attempt to drive the Led at the max level of current they would kick out into it. I was unable to get the batteries to push more than about 1.4A into the Led even with 5 tested in parallel, but with the 3 pushing it about 1A, the Led would get so hot and the light was bright enough for my taste. I had to screw the led backing onto an aluminum heatsink i ripped from some old electronics about 2x2x1in. With that heatsink I was able to drive the Led at about that 1A without seeing instant smoke from the glue i used to fix the reflector on. I ended up wiring those 3 18650's straight through a 25ohm variable resistor, which is a crude rotating knob to control brightness from low to full bright. I also threw a spliced USB connector on there for charging, no other circuit or anything just crude charging. This one ended up looking like more of a frankenstein because i could only find a reflector and reflector housing and not a frame for the body. its basically the reflector on top of the led and heatsink, on top of the 3 batteries all taped together with the sliding knob on the bottom and USB charging cable holstered down with a magnet. This setup in total ended up costing me about $2 per battery and $2 per bulb and i bought a $1.99 flashlight for its reflector so about ten bucks total as i already had junk electronics to get the switches and variable resistor from. This light is so damn bright people try to buy it from me regardless of how it looks. The only downside is, on that extreme brightness it will only run for about 30 minutes or so before noticeably dimming, yet still running bright as hell.This is where another topic comes in regarding the driving circuits. Were I to remake this same flashlight, putting more effort into it, making it look legit, with perfect housing, perfect sized reflector, water proof it, build a small charging circuit for it and even it's own charger.. all of this would still run me less than about $20 and it would perform like a $100 or more flashlight. The question however is the type of driver to use, if any.. A driving circuit is going to make the light "cut off" at a given voltage, whereas a straight connection will continue drive the led even after the voltage in the battery has dropped below the rated operating level for the led.  This can be useful in certain situations and because the Leds we are using are 3v, once the battery drops below 3v and still continues to run it, it will draw practically nothing from the battery and eventually the light will die not totally damaging the battery by drawing it down completely below 2v and so on.The driving circuit however, can ultimately make the light last longer, being that it is a pulsed DC rather than a constant, and the quality of brightness you are getting will also be a constant until the battery gets too low.I personally am totally happy with keeping my light the way it is, but making a better looking model with a metal housing for the body. The reflector is not quite a good match and it causes it to give off more of a wide beam than i want, but the light is so immense i can turn it on in my room with the lights off and it looks like i cut on my 60 watt bulb. I can put it against any other heavy duty light i have and they get put to shame. the lack of a focusing beam is the only disadvantage, but i can say if i ever had to explore a deep underground cavern and needed a bright light, i would definitely be using this one MIGHT bring the triple D maglite just as a bludgeoning tool.I also want to note that the other Cree led i had to play with ended up going in an emergency work light torch which was the familiar setup. Led hooked straight to batteries through a 25 ohm variable resistor and on/off switch. I realized I could run the Led from 3 D batteries in series and get a longer run-time than from 3 18650's in parallel. So essentially i learned playing with these Led's, that without even creating or buying a driving circuit, i could make a really bright USB rechargeable flashlight that while crude, is safe if u know what u are doing, and costs less than $20. Having said that I still respect the craftsmanship of a good flashlight and would also probably end up buying one for $100 or so just to have it.

37aubz	-59716	1432623441	flashlight	the little glow rings and 'diffusers' are a cool idea for flashlights but how about a small led to keep them glowing?	as i keep tinkering with the ultimate torch setups i keep wanting to add new things, one of which is a cool glow thingy for finding the light in the dark. but the only torch i have that uses a glow thingy never shows me its useful. assuming it is sitting in the dark somewhere and i need to find it, theres not going to be any glow. the only reason i actually discovered one of my torches had the glowing tail switch was by accidentally running another tiny light over it in the dark.but that got me thinking it should not be too hard to add a tiny circuit into the tailcap of a torch that uses a tiny lithium button cell. the circuit could blink the led very dim, but just bright enough to charge the rubber glow thingy so its visibly glowing in the dark, at all times. a circuit like that could be made to drive the blinking led underneath the glower for months on end from the single button cell and also recharge from the main battery.has anyone ever seen or owned a flashlight that had this added circuitry? or added tiny indicator led?  i assume some of the insanely expensive lights may have this but ive never seen them on cheap or mid-range torches.

3ekyug	-59716	1437848983	flashlight	just bought a Nitecore P12. My first 'quality' torch aside from the Fenix LD02. Enlightening. oh man yea that was a pun.	got it from REI, they are having a special right now where if you spend $100 they give you a $20 gift card, so i picked up the P12 and a Gerber pocket knife. edit - it's the 2015 version P12, but not sure what the difference is other than mode spacing, it has super low, low, mid, and high. 1 lumen, 70, 240, and 1000.anyhoo the P12 is heavier in my hand than i thought it would have been. When my Convoy S2 FINALLY comes in the mail i'll be able to compare the two, but the this little P12 is packing some decent heavy dutiness for good reason.  with my DIY torches, being that they are very lightweight cheapo host lights, i never pushed 1k lumens for long at all because i just couldn't. I ended up making all of those push less than 1A into the emitters because of the heat that would build up over long periods. Playing with my cheap ass 30 watt soldering iron last night i was thinking damn, this is how hot an XHP70 emitter is getting when driven at max, if it's not VERY properly sinked.The P12 gets quite warm rather fast so the master race must be rocking some gloves or something, but seriously it's honestly not that big an issue i mean the light is obviously going to get warm, but not hot enough to burn you. I'm not going to try to EDC a 4k xhp70 torch though because IMO it literally would need to be too big to dissipate the heat right if ran longer than 20 seconds or so.

I was happy with my LD02 so i just assumed on the E13 being of perfect quality as well. What do you think? big enough of a deal to take the trip to swap it out? would they even let me i wonder?

They also just seem like a more quality cell than my others.  thoughts?(Ordered them along with some 18350's from Mountain Electronics, which i will be ordering from regularly now since i was happy with the shipping.)

2lcrjg	-59739	1415180917	skyrimclasses	Meet my Etherial Housewife who just wants to be done with all this 'dragonborn' bs	It's my 5th play through of this game and after a long break I decided to come back and play something really unique. My first playthrough was a generic overpowered all-rounder Dark Elf with everything maxed, second was a full mage Altmer, third a Khajiit Assassin, fourth an Orc Berserker, you know, the most generic classes in the whole game. This time, after completing every achievement and most quests 2+ times, I wanted to do something really different; I thought I'd share with you my fun housewife class.Eviane is a Breton who grew up Camlarn in High Rock, just north of Daggerfall. Conjuration is a big part of Breton culture, and as a young girl she was taught the Bound Dagger (Bound Sword if you don't have the DLC) spell to defend herself if she ever found herself being mugged - or worse. Eviane spent a lot of her childhood pretending that such an event would arise and training herself with the spell, eventually acquiring great skill with it, however she was never put in the position to need it. When she was twenty, she fell in love with a local Nord, however he became very homesick and they decided to travel to Skyrim and get married. Skip forward ten years and Eviane's husband has been killed by a pack of Stormcloaks raiding their Falkreath farmhouse when he tried to defend his wife, leaving Eviane with a bitter hatred for the Stormcloak Rebellion. As for being caught up in Helgen, Eviane was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time (fate?). Now that her backstory is out of the way, Eviane has no interest in lugging around pieces of metal and swinging them at foes, nor does she consider herself a mage or have any proficiency in thievery/stealth. Instead, she sticks to what she knows best: Bound weapons. As well as that, Eviane does have some skill in Illusion. She won't wear silly mage robes as she's not a mage, and she won't wear heavy metal all over her body or anything of the sort. She is a classy woman, but she is able to enchant her common clothing if it will help her on her journey (I found this a bit hard in practice, so at least early game I let myself wear normal robes/armour). What Eviane does have up her sleeve is her cunning. The world has turned her against it, making her a cynical woman. She has morals, but if you stand in her way, she will get rid of you, however not in the means most would carry out. When faced with a group of hostiles, Eviane is partial to enraging the entire cohort with Fury while sitting back, only to pick off the last with her bound sword or bow. She hates getting her hands dirty and is more likely to Calm or Fear her opponent in an encounter than slit his throat like a common brute. In terms of the storyline, she will do what she has to to benefit her journey, no more, no less. She will only join certain factions if there is something in it for her. However, she must complete the Imperial quest line. Often she will travel the world with Fear/Calm in one hand and Bound Sword/Bow in the other, and as she progresses the story her proficiency with Conjuration, Illusion, One Handed, Archery and Enchanting constantly increases, while she avoids most other skills like the plague. I've had a lot of fun with this class as pacifying your foes instead of hacking them to death and relying on illusion all the time is a pretty unique way of playing the game. I shared this in the hope that someone might like to try this class or it might inspire other adaptions. Obviously when I say it's unique I'm not saying it's never been done/shared before but it's a pretty different play style to the other hack and slash classes that encompass most of the game. Hope you enjoy!
2q5e7a	-59739	1419314190	skyrim	Is this considered an exploit / cheating?	Ok so I had a level 70 assassin/nightblade/archer who was already pretty overpowered. He wore full Ancient Shrouded Armour and used Invisibility, Blade of Woe, Firniel's End and Bound Bow. Pretty much one hit everything. I came up against Karstaag and got mega-r*ped. Decided to make myself some stronger gear so I started maxing alchemy, enchanting and smithing. I specifically avoided the restoration loop exploit, because that was obviously cheating. The best I could come up with was 4 items that each gave me 27% better smithing and a bunch of potions that made my enchantments 30% stronger. Doesn't sound like that much, does it? Crafted myself a set of upgraded dragonscale armour and dragonbone bow/dagger. I put fortify archery (45% each) enchantments on at least 4 items, only avoiding fortify one-handed because it doesn't affect daggers. My dragonbone bow now hits for 300+ with falmer arrows, and my dagger for 104. Sneak attack means 900 and 3120 damage per sneak attack, respectively. My armour is also well past the 80% cap, even being light armour. Came up against the Ebony Warrior, backstabbed him for half his HP, went invisible, sneak attacked him again to finish. We never even entered open combat. Went to retry Karstaag and summoned Durneviir, only to watch the troll one-hit-KO the dragon. Proceeded to kill him with 17 dragonbone arrows, no more, no less. Didn't chug one potion or switch weapon once. I hear all these people saying "oh the only way to beat karstaag is to spam Dremora Lords and an essential follower as noob bait while whittling him down with fire over half an hour" and I'm just sitting here wondering whether I did in fact exploit a bug or cheat somehow, because this doesn't seem right. I know it's fairly normal for an assassin to clear a dungeon without taking a point of damage but I don't think anyone should be able to clear the Ebony Warrior without entering combat with him and kill karstaag without going below 80% hp. Thoughts?

2zuokh	-59739	1426979427	leagueoflegends	Anyone else having this game-breaking attack move bug since Bard patch?	This has happened in 3 games now, and it is entirely game breaking. The first time it happened at the end of the game and wasn't resolved, the 2nd was the first 20ish minutes of the game before it miraculously fixed itself (still long enough to screw me over for the rest of the game) and the last time started halfway through an ARAM and wasn't resolved. These have been in the space of about 6 games inclusive.The issue is, randomly I lose the ability to upgrade abilities, access the pause menu, click on the map to recenter the camera, space to centre camera stops working, can look at shop but not buy, and cannot use summoner spells. There are only 3 things you can do - attack move, type in chat and use pre-unlocked abilities. You can see that it is attack move from the red click marker instead of the normal green. If you hadn't unlocked any abilities (like in the 2nd game) before it starts, bad luck, you're going to be autoattacking a lot this game, which is hard to do as Swain, because you can't unlock them. Attack move also means that once you start attacking something, you can't stop until the unit dies, so there are a lot of unnecessary dives as I frantically bash my mouse in the other direction. The game is unplayable. How can I fix this? I haven't figured out how to recreate the bug yet, as entering a game right now is akin to AFK'ing, since my team has to deal with a potato who can't do anything.Help?
30kijs	-59739	1427515673	LSD	How much should my friend take for his first time?	My mate has recently come into the possession of 4 ~150ug tabs. He is super excited about his first trip, and has read up on doasage guides before, but isn't sure how much to take. Some people say take more on the first time to break through the nerves, but he thinks 2 tabs might be a little too full on.
30mwl6	-59739	1427577097	MDMA	Effects of MDMA clarification	I've searched this plenty on the Internet but haven't found much. Last night I took a 100mg cap of Molly at a nightclub/bar and after maybe 70 minutes it finally kicked in. I was expecting to just dance and dance and dance but I didn't really feel like dancing... I just wanted to sit down and really have a deep connection with someone through a conversation. I then proceeded to spend the next 4 hours sitting in different spots, grinning and laughing like a retard, sometimes by myself without caring and at other times with my friends. I know pure happiness and being content with the world are common effects, but I thought dancing was part of it? I did not feel like dancing at all, I just wanted to keep being happy. Do you think this was good or bad Molly? It was definitely a strong feeling.Edit: for about 10 minutes I had some pretty cool tingling in my fingers but other than that there were no visual distortions or strange feelings, no sensory distortions. Just happiness.
30srdh	-59739	1427717262	LSD	The day after trying acid for the first time and going on a date	Ok so it's Monday night where I live and tomorrow my buddies and I are going to go out and have our first trip in the park, starting at about 10am through to 10pm... then I'm going to come home and have a good think and hopefully a good sleep on what happened. The day after that I'm going out for coffee with a girl I asked out at about  2pm. I usually have no problems talking to girls and holding a conversation and I know for a fact that she likes me a lot (through her friends), so I'm not nervous. I just don't want to be a jittering wreck, or so exhausted that I'm unable to hold a conversation or be the same normal nice guy that I usually am. It's pretty much too late to change either now. How do you guys think I will hold up talking to the girl? Is it worth calling off the date?Not sure if it makes much difference, but I tried MDMA the other day for the first time as well (just a moderate 100mg dose) and felt absolutely no noticeable comedown. I'm planning on just taking one 150ug blotter (says &gt;90% purity on the back) tomorrow so its not really a heavy dose. 
312f68	-59739	1427902242	LSD	Is lack of bitter taste enough to rule out NBOMe's?	I got some new tabs from my dealer, which are about 0.5x0.5cm in size. On the front they have a cartoon like normal and on the back they are white with font that reads:LSD150ug(&gt;)90%Best Before04/2016When I was buying them, the dealer said that they don't numb your mouth, are tasteless and you can swallow them right off the bat. Immediately I thought - well that rules out the possibility of the guy selling NBOMe's while honestly believing they are LSD, and those descriptions are exactly what you want (i.e. no taste). I took 1.5 tabs and I could definitely taste something, but it wasn't bitter... it just tasted like paper. My mouth wasn't numb from it either, even though I kept it in my mouth. But I was reading up on the effects of 25i-NBOMe's and how it didn't really produce euphoria, just trippy visuals, and I realised I wasn't particularly euphoric during the trip. Now I'm not sure if what I got was really LSD, or perhaps just some cross tolerance (lack of seratonin) after taking MDMA a few days prior that stopped the euphoria. TLDR;If it's not bitter and says LSD on the blotter, is that enough to safely assume it's LSD? Testing kits are not an option (live with my parents, not having acid testing kits showing up in the mail). 
319p02	-59739	1428029572	Drugs	Have any of you told your parents about recreational drug use and how did they react?	I'm 17 and in my final year of High School. Recently I've been experimenting with MDMA and LSD, outside of the usual weed ventures. Needless to say I love both Molly and Lucy now, and I'm being responsible in how much I use it and how so that things don't get out of hand. Recently I've been thinking about how much I would love to share this with my Dad (mother wouldn't enjoy/approve, has never smoked pot, but my Dad used to be a heavy underage drinker and said he's smoked a bit of pot over the years).I really want them to understand my views on how safe LSD and other psychedelic drugs are when used responsibly but I am worried that they are too brainwashed by the government propaganda around how "bad for your health" they are. I have a source for some DMT, which I think might be a better option due to it's much shorter effects, but $40 a point seemed ludicrously expensive (is it??), especially when the dealer said 2 points would be a breakthrough trip ($80 for a half hour trip!! No way). Anyway I am not sure how to suggest trying some LSD to my Dad, or whether it's even a good idea or not. Once I turn 18 I am an adult but I'm not sure.TLDR;Title, when did you tell them, and also is $40 a point reasonable for DMT? I figured I'd be better off making my own once I got my own house.Edit: just to clarify, in Australia both the drinking and driving age is 18, so turning 18 a much bigger deal. Even so, I'll still be in High School so it may still be too early.
31r2cd	-59739	1428417138	microdosing	What dosage should I aim at?	From a previous trip I have half a 150ug tab of LSD and was considering using it to microdose. It says on the back (normal cartoon on the front) that it's 150ug at &gt;90% purity. Would it be best to cut it into 3 ~25ug doses? I honestly have no idea what is on the tabs and it's fairly safe to assume there's less than 150ug, especially since it says 90% purity. Is &lt;25ug good for a microdose or am I better off cutting it into &lt;18ug quarters? I don't know that my fingers would be capable of going that small, but some people here say they cut their tabs into 8ths. Also, how long do you wait between microdoses (for tolerance)? I was planning on doing it Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Thanks!
322u1p	-59739	1428635234	Drugs	Has LSD or shrooms altered your weed high?	I've only taken LSD once (no shrooms) but today when I smoked some pot, this being the 2nd time high since doing the LSD, I could see intense closed eye visuals, which I had never seen with weed since taking the LSD. The CEV's on acid for me wasn't like seeing, it was like floods of fluorescent colours and abstract cartoons which I couldn't actually see but could 'feel' inside my mind and couldn't actually focus on, however these new CEV's on weed were like watching a little TV in my head that played both abstract and non-abstract objects, often having real people or snippets of movies and stuff on it and I could focus my eyes on it. I also noticed my thought patterns have been much more 'psychedelic' - if that's the right word for it - while high since doing LSD. So now I'm just curious, are these weed CEV's normal effects? Does a psychedelic experience change the weed high? I feel like LSD may have unlocked other effects of weed that my mind didn't even know was possible up to using it. 
32sk38	-59739	1429182550	Drugs	DXM question...	
33436b	-59739	1429436352	atheism	Is it possible to be an atheist yet still be 'spiritual'? Are you?	Whatever the word 'spiritual' means to you- are you a spiritual person while still rejecting the idea of God? I used to be a full atheist, believing that we have no free will (just neural impulses that are determined by genetics and past experiences) and that when you die, that's it, there is nothing else. As I got into my late teens I found this a fairly unpleasant thought and sometimes wished I was brought up religious, since now I cannot force myself to believe in 'God' or anything of the sort. I ended up trying out a few psychedelics - mushrooms, LSD, DMT and the like, being responsible with their use and knowing the safety precautions well beforehand - to hopefully give me some sort of new meaning of life and a sense of spirituality. Now, being a self-proclaimed /r/psychonaut I do have strong feelings of spirituality and interconnectedness, although I am still not religious  nor do I believe in God. I much better understand my own conscious now and think that at the end of the day, it doesn't matter what you believe as long as it gives you comfort through life. Now when people ask my religion I am far more inclined to say agnostic. Some of these psychedelic experiences have shown me that it's fairly arrogant to argue that there is no God - because with estimates of over 100 thousand million stars (not planets!) in the universe, even if there is a 1/100 billion chance that an identical earth, or a God, or a giant flying spaghetti monster does exist, then it probably does. Sorry about the rant, I wasn't meaning to get into a rant.TLDR: Title. Are you a spiritual person?
337y2j	-59739	1429526552	Christianity	Do you guys believe what is written in the Bible?	Do you believe that the Bible is the 'word of God'? Do you believe that the words contained within should be held up as indisputable truth? What is your opinion on conflicting areas, such as those that speak of slavery, homosexuality and the like? If the Bible says slavery is ok, does that make it OK?Just curious about what you guys think. I've known many, many Christians who take the words of the Bible as law and take them as literally as is humanly possible, including those on homosexuality, slavery, etc. I personally think that the Bible is a nice little guide to life with some handy hints about how to be a good person, but I don't think it has any relation to 'God' or anything supernatural at all. It's just a book that preaches a lot of logical errors and historical errors, regardless of who is proposed to have written it. This is just my opinion of course, I am interested to hear yours. 
33grfy	-59739	1429703926	Drugs	What drugs are out there that you think everyone should try at least once? When do you draw the line?	So this is kind of a bucket-list. I am fairly new to this community so I don't know if many people are similar to me, but I don't look to drugs to get high (even though it is a welcome side effect) or to fix any problems in my life. I am simply vastly intrigued by their effects and want to use them for self betterment, and I love experiencing new things. So far I've only used MDMA and LSD, and while I intend on taking LSD much more, I am keeping it at a very low rate. Some of the effects of these two have seemingly rubbed off onto my sober self, which is what I always hoped they would do, even though I've only taken each once. I find myself seeing much more beauty in the world that I didn't before, and I often catch myself smiling for no reason just like I did on the MDMA. To be honest- I don't think I will ever abuse drugs, not because I have the self control, but because I am scared shitless of the risks of addiction and how easily it can come about. I do understand that this is also likely a naïve thought, so I'm not getting cocky, and have set up precautions. As I research more, I become more and more interested in lots of different drugs and their effects, and like to be very educated on the effects of drugs, so I read up before I even think about trying the drug. I know I am the kind of person who, when offered a Valium at a party, will probably say "fuck it, why not", so I like to at least have some idea of what to expect and how to react. Right now, the drugs that I am really interested to try are:DMT (hopefully soon), Ketamine (am mostly interested in experiencing a K-hole), Shrooms (even though they don't appeal to me as much as LSD), Salvia, Adderall and DXM.My question is: What drugs do you recommend adding to the list? What drugs do you think have the most potential for improving your sober self? I am interested in Valium/Xanax and some other stuff, but am freakishly scared of benzo withdrawls. Am I being naïve in thinking that you can take these once or twice without negative repercussions? Is it worth trying cocaine/heroin other high level drugs just once to see what they are like, then never again? I am asking this question here because there is very little information about which drugs better your sober self the most, and when you look for drug information on the internet, 3/4 of what you see is government misinformation telling you that one puff of weed will make you schizophrenic for life and LSD will make you jump off a building, so I figured the lovely folks here at reddit might be able to provide a more balanced insight. Sorry for the long post! 
33kwxm	-59739	1429785312	LSD	Thoughts on going for a bike-ride while peaking?	Going for my 2nd trip this weekend on about 250ug, and I thought since I missed Bicycle Day that it would be cool to get out the bike. I live in an urban city though, so traffic and other people will be everywhere, unlike in the countryside. There will be plenty of spots to hop off and lie down in the grass but I don't want to put myself in danger due to being intoxicated while riding. Is it fun to trip while cycling? 
33vxy1	-59739	1430019564	Drugs	Where to meet other trippers?	I go to a pretty sheltered school where a few kids do MDMA when out at clubs but they are all shit scared (for god knows what reason) of LSD/Shrooms/basically any psychs. Even my friends who know that I'm using LSD responsibly and for the right reasons aren't interested in doing it themselves. This leaves me usually tripping by myself out in the park or in nature somewhere, which is fun, but I would love to try it with other people. Where and what is a good way to meet/get in contact with other trippers? How can I convince others to come out and do it with me?
34ddim	-59739	1430374696	Drugs	Psychedelics seem so benign	Note: I know a chemical can not be benign by nature, but I'm talking about the emotions one may feel towards said chemical.Whenever I think about psychedelics, especially LSD, I get this overwhelming sense that the drug is well meaning and wants to improve me in lots of different ways (i.e. by teaching me important stuff). I guess this comes from the relatively few side effects of LSD, it's lack of any addiction potential, lack of toxicity and the profound experience it brings. When I think about drugs, the big bad boys like meth/heroin are angrily standing in one corner, daring you to play with them, but you know to take extreme caution when playing with them. Then far away over in the other corner, there's a pack of rainbows and unicorns labelled psychedelics. When I trip this feeling gets amplified tenfold, like lucy has her own way of imposing herself by telling you that "all drugs are bad! Stop using them! But use me, use me all you want, I'm a good drug!"Does anyone else think about psychedelics like this or am I still tripping?

34x8nq	-59739	1430816970	Drugs	Best value drugs?	What drugs do you guys find gives the best value (if that's the right way to put it), i.e. has the best mix of low price, low health risk and strong/long lasting effects? All I can think of right now, for example, is LSD at one end of the spectrum, which is cheap, really long lasting and has very few health risks ($15-30 for 12 solid hours).At the other end of the spectrum would be something like cocaine, which is massively expensive and very short lasting, and while it's not the worst - it's not really the best for your health. No hate on cocaine, it's just too much of a luxury for me. So what other drugs do you think have nice balances -similar to LSD? Not sure if this makes sense but I guess I'll find out soon
35a7yb	-59739	1431087836	atheism	How much of the world is actually that relgious? It is just America where these terrible 'coming out' stories originate?	When I found this forum it was immensely interesting to read about lots of different stories of people who had 'come out' about their atheism to their parents, crying out for help in unforgiving communities, and plenty more. It was such a foreign concept at first that I couldn't believe these things actually happened, until I started reading more... and more... and more. I grew up in Melbourne, the 2nd largest city in Australia, where it's pretty hard to find a single person who goes to church. My Dad's an atheist, my Mum was raised as a Catholic but thinks religion is dumb, and every single one of the kids at my high school is either an atheist or not openly religious. It's almost the the complete opposite to what I hear about here on /r/atheism, in Aus if you come out as believing in God in Australia, roughly half will respect your beliefs but not agree and half will just label you stupid and move on. Most people in Australia see it like this: when Britain colonised both Australasia and North America, the religious freaks all went to America and dug their claws in, while the convicts and free-spirited lower-class people flocked to Australia to drink as much beer and have as much sex as they could under the sun without the filthy poms restricting us. Nowadays that mindset is still very much alive, we aren't poor or convicts any more but we still love beer and sex, and have a healthy disrespect for any form of authority, be it police officers or priests telling us what we can and can't do. Our last Prime Minister was an Atheist - I'd like to see that happen in America.I actually want to study abroad for my undergraduate in the States, and quite frankly I can't wait to come over and give anyone who wants it a piece of my mind. I've got no reservations about standing up for what I believe in, mainly because I always have somewhere else to fall back on. But it's made me start wondering... Is this issue with America being overly religious (not just in the Bible-belt, but in general) or Australia being overly anti-religious? I know that there are plenty of countries, especially in the middle-east, which are heavily religious, but you don't get the kind of stories from there as you do from America. Can anyone from countries like Britain, Germany, France and other Western societies shed some light on how open-minded and religious their society is?I feel like Australia and America are pretty much polar-opposites when it comes to religion, I just don't know which end the rest of the world lies closer to. Edit: How do I fix the typo in the title?
35hqg0	-59739	1431267391	Drugs	Does this sound like HPPD?	Straight off the bat - I've done plenty of research on HPPD and I know that there's a fair chance that it will go away or I'll just learn to live with it. However the descriptions of it are very clinical and I'm finding it hard to identify if I actually do have some degree of HPPD. Everyone I know already thinks I'm stupid for using LSD (government misinformation game too strong) so coming out and saying I might have a possible mental illness from LSD isn't going to do me any favours. When I look at things there are no perceptual distortions. However in the corner of my eye, I often see tiny little blips, which get worse when it's dark. That's not particularly distressing by itself, but my mind seems to give unnecessary meaning to them. Right now if I look so that the doorknob is in my peripheral vision, it's too blurred to see clearly but I can't help *feeling* like there's a spider there, even though I know it's not. I keep thinking the blips on my vision are scary looking figures standing in the doorway. It's definitely an unpleasant feeling, but it's not surprising or scary, its more of thinking about the unpleasant feeling half a second after it's passed, with no tangible reaction.An example of this 'extra meaning' is when it got worse the last time I smoked weed, which I did alone out of boredom while my parents were out of the house, and ... you know the way light skews along your eyelashes when you look at it from different angles? Well in my peripheral vision the light along my eyelashes kind of skewed into horizontal lines, and I immediately thought this was my Dad wearing his striped rugby jumper, standing in the corner, which scared me because I was high as fuck and didn't want to get caught. Another time, for example, someone tried to put the base of a plastic poppy (without the petals) in my hand, and I immediately shit myself because I thought it was a spider, which I have never done before.I know these aren't great descriptions but I'm sure you guys know how hard it is to describe the effects of hallucinogens. TL;DR – No tangible perceptual distortions but my mind is giving unnecessary meaning to anything unclear in my field of view, generally with a sinister/scary undertone. Does this sound like HPPD? Thanks guys
35lcua	-59739	1431350287	Drugs	Advice on getting drugs for friends	Alright so long story short I live in a very sheltered society the kids at my school are all high achieving, and are all very scared of using drugs but love drinking. The extent of drug use is pot, but it's hardly a culture. My use of LSD and MDMA, along with various other things, has given me the reputation of 'the drug guy' at school. Most kids claim they would never ever use anything past weed occasionally. However when we are at a party and a few beers have gone down the hatch any form of reluctance to use drugs goes straight out the window. People have started begging me for cocaine when they are drunk (I've never tried it) and a few desperately want to drop acid while we are there. MDMA requests are almost a given.The point is, I'm feeling really pressured into giving these kids drugs when we are at parties, and to be honest, I really want to take some with them and show them how great they are. But I'm not up to screw anyone's lives up, and I definitely don't want any accidents on my hands. I can get ketamine, acid, shrooms and MD easily, and cocaine + lots of other shit if I really tried.However it seems that each of these would be a bad idea to introduce to my friends as they generally all go poorly with alcohol, even to the extent of being very dangerous. Do you guys have any idea of some fairly accessible (i.e. not obscure RC's that are impossible to find) party drugs that would give the best time with the least safety risks? And do you have any tips on how to ensure that me getting a little -insert substance- for the party won't end up in a potentially very bad time? I'm not particularly experienced but I have done plenty of research and am committed to being safe with this. Thanks!
36f6kh	-59739	1431988128	relationships	Me [17 M] with my ex's best friend [17 F]... What do I do now?	Ok so I had a thing with this girl named A and liked her enough to ask her out after she'd asked me to her prom. She has very strict parents and replied with "Yes, but my parents don't want me to date until 18" so I said well we don't have to tell them, just think about it. 2 weeks goes past and I've heard nothing, and I don't know where I stand or what to do. At the prom I ask her if she's thought any harder and she looks surprised, then hesitates for about 20 seconds before reluctantly saying yes. Now I really don't know what to do, as her body language and everything is saying no. We aren't even hugging let alone kissing. We get to the prom and I'm sitting between her and her best friend named B, who has taken a family friend to prom. I end up chatting non-stop to her best friend and we get on 10 times better than I ever did with A – flirting, teasing each other, laughing, hugging – all things I never really did with A. But I keep telling myself to stop thinking about how great she is because I'm here with A. Then comes the afterparty, and A isn't drinking so she goes off somewhere. I end up spending the whole time with B, laughing and carrying on, and she's made it crystal clear through how she's acting that she really likes me. I start thinking to myself that I'm done with being stuck in this grey area with A, who I barely even like anymore, and that if she wants to act like we aren't dating then she shouldn't expect me to act any differently. So I decide to go for it and kiss B. She kisses back, hard. We end up making out down the back for about an hour, giggling and playing with each other's hair, and I had butterflies in my stomach the entire time. I've never felt that with any other casual hookups at parties, and one of her friends told me I was the 2nd guy she'd ever kissed, so I would hope that means it meant something to her as well. That was a few days ago. A hates me and I haven't spoken to B. I'm sure their friendship is suffering, which makes me feel absolutely terrible. I'm not a bad guy, I never thought I would cheat on anyone (even though I don't think this really is). I still really really like B and I haven't stopped thinking about the kiss with her. Is it wrong to pursue her, given the circumstances? Should I just cut my losses and move on? How can I help their friendship recover? I know I should leave it for A's sake but I don't know if I can given how I'm feeling right now. Was I right to kiss her in the first place? Where do I go from here?    **tl;dr**: Kissed my psuedo (though not really) girfriend's best friend and now I can't stop thinking about her. What do I do?
390cba	-59739	1433754854	Drugs	Researching psychedelics and other drugs	I have been thinking a lot lately about going into a field or psychopharmacology or neuropsychopharmacology, however with all of the stigma and taboos regarding drugs, I don't really know who to talk to or ask about it. I know my parents and many adults would be accepting if I talked to them about it, but such a discussion would bring up plenty of unwanted questions such as "is he using these drugs?" and "how long will it be before he starts using these drugs?". So I came here to ask the friendly people of the internet about this recent interest. I guess this will be a fairly long post, but I want to give a little bit of background first. **There will be a TL;DR at the end.** --I'm a high-school student in my final year at high school. I've always been very interested in science when watching documentaries, but I did pretty badly in chemistry, biology and physics in years 9 and 10, so I figured after that that I was just bad at science even though it interested me. Looking back in hindsight I can see that I just rode out my natural intelligence with all my other classes and still got good grades without putting effort in, and with the same subconscious expectations I didn't put any effort in to the sciences at all, yet I couldn't rely on natural intelligence with these, so they left a pretty sour taste in my mouth once I was finished.I've always been really interested by how the brain/consciousness works, and my favourite class at school right now is Psychology. After school I was planning to take a uni course in Psychology and hopefully marketing/advertising to apply the principles of psychology to help me sell shit to consumers. In psych we have just finished a huge unit on states of consciousness, however as a pseudoscience (along with the fact that it's a high-school course, not a uni course) it takes a pretty surface view of the subject. We primarily learn about how to distinguish between states of consciousness (e.g. a key difference between being in an altered state of consciousness and normal-waking-consciousness is one's perception of the passage of time), rather than going deeper to understand what actually changes in the brain in different states of consciousness or anything else of interest. It was actually the psychology textbook that I was reading (our syllabus conveniently skips this section - presumably to avoid sparking interest in people like me) when I came across a small section which explained the differences between stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens and cannabis, along with examples. This prompted me to start researching what LSD and psilocybin were online, along with numerous other drugs. I previously knew about most of the big name drugs - heroin, meth, coke, ecstasy, cannabis - from the media, but this was my first time actually learning about them from an unbiased perspective and I was immediately hooked on learning about them. As soon as I started reading about LSD I immediately knew I had to try some of this stuff for myself, but I still wanted to be safe and educated myself heavily on the dangers of the drug. Luckily I found that it is mostly harmless if you are very careful and treat it with ample respect, so I went out and bought myself some. Keep in mind all the kids at my school are pretty anti-drugs so this was mostly a solo expedition. Needless to say I loved it but what intrigued me more was finding out how it actually created these effects on the brain. I kept researching lots and lots of drugs and I've been pretty much checking this subreddit daily just because I can't get enough of the information about any and all drugs. The extent of my experience actually using drugs still sits with cannabis, MDMA, LSD, nicotine, caffeine and alcohol, but (correct me if I am wrong) I feel like most of the effects of lots of drugs have been pretty much understood (e.g. drugs that resemble chemicals like serotonin and dopamine in structure and therefor stimulate those receptors in our brain), but the way psychedelic drugs create such powerful experiences is still not understood. I feel like there are a huge number of possibilities in finding new medical applications in these drugs, but I honestly believe that LSD and other hallucinogens can help us understand how our brain and consciousness work better than ever before. So I've been seriously considering the possibility of going into a field of work that will allow me to learn more about these drugs and share this with the world. I want to change the world's perception of these drugs and stop them from being looked down upon as purely hedonistic by showing people how to use them as tools and support further research into their effects. I want to be a big-name advocate for the legalisation of such drugs under supervised conditions. However I don't know if I am chasing an impossible dream over this taboo subject. I don't want to spend my entire life fighting for funding and access to research these drugs. I know scientists work off the funding provided by the government and independent bodies, but what is the likelihood of getting funding when the government doesn't want anyone to research these drugs and independent bodies don't want to be seen to be supporting drug-use? I really don't know where to go from here. Is there anyone I can talk to about this? Would my best bet be to perhaps try and minor in biology/biochemistry at uni and see if I like it when I actually apply myself to it? Is anyone here in a similar field that may be able to share their opinion/story with me? Thanks for taking the time to read. **TL;DR:** Found a new interest in the effect of drugs (primarily psychedelics) on the brain and despite previously not being great at science, I want to be at the forefront of the new push to better understand these drugs and use them to improve our understanding of consciousness and the brain, however I don't know if it's even a plausible career choice or how to go about it given that it's not really a subject that you can talk openly about.
39ox5r	-59739	1434189436	Drugs	Campaigning for the legalisation (decriminalisation) of drugs amongst other things as a career choice.	Hey guys, I'm just looking for some ideas here. I've spent a long time on this sub and one of my recent posts was about becoming a psychopharmacologist or neuropyschopharmacologist. I've been reading a lot about the war on drugs (Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs is a really good read) and I've realised I'm actually really really passionate about making a change in society regarding this. I'm about to head off to uni, so my career path is still very much up in the air, and until now I wanted to do something to do with psychology and marketing/advertising because I like manipulating people's views. But now I realise I want to do something that is directly related to changing people's opinions regarding drugs/war on drugs/drug users/etc. I know these are pretty far fetched, but no-one ever got anywhere meaningful without aiming high. Some of things I would very much like to see before I leave this world are:* Less or no stigma regarding drug use, especially things like psilocybin and MDMA* Legal LSD, MDMA and psilocybin psychotherapy practices for dealing with PTSD, depression and many other illnesses * Far less restrictions on scientific research of these substances * Decriminalisation of possession – I'm not sure about the laws on alcohol in the US and other places but here in Australia alcohol is supposed to be drunk in private establishments (i.e. in bars or at home instead of in public) and the police can take it off you if you walk around outside with an opened alcoholic drink, which I think would also work very well for drugs. * Rehab for addicts rather than mandatory incarceration * Other things I haven't thought of yetRight now, I can only think of 3 career choices that would allow me to impact this stuff: starting a nonprofit organisation to campaign for this stuff, becoming a respected psychopharmacologist or neurologist and then using that position to influence people (Dr. Carl Hart – look him up if you haven't seen his Ted Talks), or working for a preexisting organisation, like EmmaSofia. The issue is that starting a NPO yourself costs a huge amount of money that I don't have and it won't help me put food on the table for a family later in life. Becoming a scientist is a big leap because it's a lot of time spent studying for a more-than-likely chance of being told no, I can't study any of those things. And while I would love to earn a wage by working with EmmaSofia, it doesn't really seem like a place well-suited for employing people. I'm sure there must be other organisations out there with similar interests, but I don't know of any. So my question is... how can I turn this dream of eliciting social change into a reality, while actually having a career and not living on the streets? It seems like to be a full-on campaigner for social change, you must give up the chance to live a normal life and earn your own money. Do you guys have any suggestions about jobs/careers that help me achieve this? Thanks for reading. **TL;DR:** I want to campaign for social reform and the end of the war on drugs, but how can I balance this with a normal career and not give up everything for it?
39wz5j	-59739	1434377256	beer	What kind of people drink Canadian Club?	This question is a bit of an oddball, but I have a costume party coming up in two weeks and the theme (does anyone on the planet actually like themes?) is to dress up as a stereotype of someone who would drink your favourite alcoholic beverage.  Now even though I've drunk plenty of the stuff I still have very limited knowledge on the world of beer/alcohol and I'm only 18, so I still haven't acquired the taste for it yet. My favourite drink is Canadian Club Dry, which wikipedia tells me is only made in Australia so I better clarify: It's a premixed can/330ml bottle of normal Canadian Club whiskey with dry ginger. You can also get it in a Cola variant, which has, you guessed it, coke instead of dry ginger. I know it's a bitch drink. I know premixed cans are for losers. I get it. But I only tolerate the taste of proper beers at my age and this is the only drink that I can not only tolerate but enjoy drinking just as I might enjoy a soft drink. So what do you guys think the stereotypical Canadian Club drinker might look like? What about your average whisky drinker? I guess an example might be if my favourite drink was some kind of rum, I could show up dressed as a sailor or pirate. I just can't figure out what to dress as for a whiskey/canadian club drinker. The role of "bitch" will already be taken by all those who drink UDLs and the like. Any generic suggestions for what I could show up as?
3b1nt6	-59739	1435213723	Drugs	Is anti-drug war stuff a new push or has it been this way for ages?	I realised a few months ago after extreme interest in the topic as well as being passionate about ending the war on drugs that this is what I want to do with my life: Join a nonprofit organisation like Drug Policy Alliance and work towards this goal as a career. This has inevitably led to me researching the topic to a great extent, however I can't tell if the recent news articles and relevant media are representing a new push or if this has been the case for some time. For example, I'm reading a recently published (early 2015) book called 'Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs', as well as seeing lots of posts here and in the news about this, such as the post on /r/christianity linked from this sub about the 600 churches calling for an end on the war on drugs. I can't tell if this kind of news is becoming more frequent or if I'm just much more perceptive of it now. Which is it?
3b2gnh	-59739	1435236900	DarkNetMarkets	Unreasonable prices on the DNM? What am I doing wrong?	I'm pretty new to this, so please forgive me if it's a really basic question. I've searched around and can't find anything similar to this. I am beginning to teach myself more about how bitcoins/mining works and wrap my head around the bitcoin concept. However the pricing of these seems very very strange and I feel like something in my calculations is off. I was browsing a few marketplaces, not intending to buy yet, just scoping prices, and I was pleasantly surprised at how cheap some things are like 10 LSD tabs for $50, which would cost me $150 off the street where I live. However next to these listings are ones that offer 1 singular LSD tab of similar content for upwards of $25. Initially I dismissed this huge price discrepancy as an oddity of these marketplaces. However then I started looking at counterfeit money, out of interest. I found some listings for counterfeit $500 Australian dollars, made in Aus and shipped to Aus. When I plugged in the BTC to AUD numbers into google it came out to cost $672.79. Now, forgive me if I am speaking out of line here but who in their right mind would pay almost $700 of *legit* money in exchange for $500 of *fake* money? Surely this can't be just a nuance of the seller. I must be getting something wrong here. What is going on?Edit: Since people are saying it's probably bad math or an inaccurate exchange rate:The $500 of counterfeit money is listed at 2.14964861 BTC. This is on Agora, so there is no option to display in different currencies that I have found yet. Typing "2.14964861 BTC to AUD" into google results in $673.20 (slightly different from original already). Should I avoid using google currency converter when dealing with bitcoins?

3bdui3	-59739	1435477342	Drugs	Is tripping alone in the dark a bad idea?	I've tripped on L twice now, both alone (as all of my friends are anti-drugs). I still live at home so both times I left the house and just hung out in the park near my house or wandered around. I specifically enjoy just shutting my eyes for the majority of the time and listening to music while drifting off into other places. However, that was in summer. It's winter now, and it's cold and shitty outside. I can't spend the whole day outside because chances are it will probably rain and I'm likely to get sick. So I was considering tonight or another night waiting until my parents were in bed (11:30pm most likely) or dropping at maybe 11 so that it was kicking in around 12. I've heard lots of things about tripping alone in the dark - from the amazing mckenna heroic dose of shrooms to how easy it is to have a bad trip. I would consider myself pretty mentally stable, I'm able to look at myself in a mirror while tripping and see my skin fall off my face without being too heavily effected by it. My first trip was on 225ug and my second was on 300. However this is what they were advertised as from the DNM so chances are it's less. They do have the dosage and purity printed on the back however. Both times during the trips I never felt any form of negative feelings. Knowing this, I think I'd probably be fine to trip here in my room. However I've only ever done drugs at home twice (smoking pot), and one of those times could only be described as a bad trip on weed. I know I sound like an idiot for saying I had a bad trip on weed, but it honestly felt like the weed had triggered an hour long acid flashback but it was very unpleasant. It was dark and in the lounge area when my parents are out and I felt terrible about doing it at home, as well as often seeing (half hallucinating) my dad in the corner of my eye like he had just walked in the door. Not fun. So I'm a little wary of doing it at home now. Is it too risky to try tripping alone in a dark room? The logical part of my mind tells me that my parents never come in, they would be asleep, I could just tell them I'm listening to music, I feel very safe in my home/room, etc. but I don't know how well these ideas will hold up once I'm under the influence. Thoughts?Edit: I was planning on maybe bumping it up to the 400ug's range for my next trip. Too much in this environment?
3bhkew	-59739	1435563249	Drugs	Extremely long acid trip?	I dropped 330ug last night at 10:30pm in my room. Everything went fine and I finished peaking right on cue at 3:30am and I settled in to watch the sunrise out on the balcony etc. It's now 5:30pm this evening and I still can't sleep. I wanted to have at least a nap to recover from an all nighter, but my body won't listen. My body aches from being so tired and my eyes feel wired open even though they hurt from being so tired. Yet I can't go to sleep. Was still getting mild OEV's up until around 11am and my pupils didn't de-moon until literally 5pm. I just want to fucking go to sleep. I reckon the trip was still going at least until 12pm+, however I only peaked for the normal amount of time. What's up?? I thought I would be able to sleep once I was past the 11-12 hour mark. I was very sure this stuff was real L before I took it, same source as last time who got it through the DNM, "LSD" printed on the back along with dosage, purity and date laid, and it wasn't particularly bitter. I also deliberately swallowed it as soon as I put it into my mouth in case it was an NBOMe. Are DOx orally active or just sublingual? I can't find much information on DOx around. Is it normal to have a trip lasting probably about 14+ hours with complete insomnia 19 hours since dropping? Again, my pupils didn't go down until like an hour ago. EDIT: thanks for the advice guys, I smoked a little pot (deliberately kept it to like 1/3 of a bowl) and instantly felt pinned down to my bed and really quite sedated, which I've never felt before, probably because I always smoke more than a bowl and get way too high. Ended up sleeping from 7:30pm through to 2pm today. Solid 19 hour sleep ahah and I'm still a little drowsy.
3c02kv	-59739	1435937393	Diablo	I don't understand how to get motivated games like this but I would like to... (Noob question)	I bought Diablo 3 about a year ago because I thought it seemed like a pretty cool game to play and as my friend and I were away on a holiday we thought it would be fun to play together. We ended up finishing the campaign of both D3 and Reaper of Souls in about a week, and hopped online with our other buddy to quest for the secret items to get to whimsyshire (I think that's what it's called). After that, it seemed like we had completed everything of interest and moved on to other things. After talking to said friend (the one who took us to the secret level and wasn't on holiday with us) recently he pointed out that the campaign is not the primary reason why people play Diablo, it's the grinding to be able to beat higher and higher torment levels until you are basically a god fighting lots of demigods. So I decided to give D3 another go with this in mind and convinced my friend to download the whole 16gb game once again. I told him my goal was to beat torment 6 on my Wizard. He said alright, what do we do first. According to the guide our first step was to hit level 70 before we started looking for best-in-slot rares, followed by best-in-slot legendaries, followed by set items, etc. So we started the grind from our current level 50 wizard and paladin. After about 3 hours of running around from place to place killing swarms of enemies (this was on master, by the way, as no torments were unlocked), we had both gone from about 50 to 52. My friend was the first to break the ice by saying "this is fucking boring, why are we doing this?". I couldn't help but agree. I really *want* to get into the endgame, get addicted to the endless quest for better items, the challenge of beating new difficulties, etc. but I just don't know how. I have an easy time getting addicted to almost any other grinding based games, because the purpose to grinding seems very obvious and rewarding. MMORPGs, for example, like World of Warcraft, have multiple reasons you may want to level up and grind. For one, it is online and there are people around that you can show off all of your cool items to.There are places in the game that require a well equipped character to traverse, and the form of the game inspires the want for exploration of the massive game world. There are really awesome rewards for being a high level character (i.e. riding a dragon instead of a wolf). I can't see any of these elements in a game like Diablo 3. You can only play in small parties of people you actually know, and since few of my friends actually care about the game (generally due to the reasons I've stated), there is no allure to impress them with cool items. Nor is there the drive to explore or unlock new stuff by reaching higher levels. So I decided to look at single-player focussed grinding games for better comparison. Let's take Skyrim for example. In Skyrim, the drive to level up and keep playing is generally created by the world and being able to explore it, as well as the overabundance (literally unlimited) of quests and things to do, thanks to extensive content and the radiant quest system. I've plugged over 600 hours into that game ON THE VANILLA VERSION and my quest logs are still full. However, in Diablo 3, the side quests are negligible and the general campaign is very linear, which doesn't inspire the want to level up my character so I can keep questing. It's also really fun to take down enemies in Skyrim and other similar games like The Witcher 3, which isn't really the case in Diablo as it mostly just revolves around mashing spells and running around. In Diablo it seems the only purpose to grinding is so that you can tackle harder difficulty levels. But what point is there in that? I see that it's a challenge a lot of players aspire to achieve, but there's no real allure in that for me. When I play my mage, I sit at the back and spam every spell I know to deal with the endless monsters. As I raise the difficulty, it seems they just have more hitpoints and do more damage. So as I grind for better items, I do more damage and have more hitpoints, so I bump up the difficulty so that I can keep sitting at the back and mindlessly spamming spells while I watch a clusterfuck of overpowered me versus overpowered enemies. I can't see any tangible differences in gameplay or why this is considered fun. Don't get me wrong, I'm not hating on Diablo. I think it's an awesome game, and for my first playthrough of the campaign I had a great time. I think it's got really good production value and everything seems very high quality. It's not the game that I don't understand, it's the premise. But I paid $100 for this game and the expansion, so I feel like I'm not playing this really high quality game the way it should by playing the campaign for a week and then quitting. I have a very addictive personality so I hope that once I understand better what I am actually supposed to be doing in the game I might get hooked and get some value for my money. What's the point of doing anything post-campaign? Sorry for any inaccuracies (I'm sure there's some). 
3d2zbg	-59739	1436755812	Drugs	Are bad trips really that much of a reality for experienced users?	Whenever I read posts on here or other forums exclaiming "I took acid, had a traumatising experience and now I can't deal with the consequences" I just can't help but think they've brought it on themselves and that they really should have been more careful. The first time I took acid I prepared myself at such extraordinary lengths so that I knew all about what was going to happen and had plenty of action plans if I didn't enjoy myself. I wrote on one hand "You're just tripping, it will wear off soon and everything will be normal" and on the other, I wrote "feeling shit? go somewhere different and change the song". I educated myself all about the possibilities – for example, some people feel really unwell or shitty because they need to take a piss or are thirsty but the messages get jumbled up and mistranslated into general feelings of unease. Therefor an easy solution to having a bad time is to get up, go to the toilet and get a glass of water. I could go on and on. Every trip I have is wonderful and not once have I ever let a bad thought slip into my mind when tripping. Even when I tripped for 12 hours straight in absolute darkness, I often had to fight off scary images (CEVs while eyes were open) in the dark, but I never let it affect my mood and always stepped back to say "woah brain, don't get too dark on my ass". I'm not calling myself an experienced user by any means, but I'd like to think that I've educated myself pretty heavily on the subject. Are some people just more prone to bad trips than others? I feel as though the main reason for bad experiences is taking the drug on a whim when you are not thinking about the consequences (e.g. drunk), taking it right after something negative has happened in your life or being uneducated of the effects and subsequently freaking out because you don't know what's happening. To me, the answer is simple – learn about what you're taking, don't take it in shitty circumstances and you reduce your risk of having a bad trip to practically nothing.Obviously this is excluding those who deliberately induce bad trips to help them sort through the demons in their lives, and perhaps I'm being very naïve, but I can't help but feel when you take precautions and use responsibly, there is almost no chance of having a bad trip and bad trips are generally the fault of the user for not respecting the drug. Thoughts? Comments? Edit: I guess in the case of well known trippers who have had publicized bad trips, such as Terence McKenna, it may just be a case of becoming complacent and feeling as though you're able to handle more than you actually can. An example might be someone that has tripped over a hundred times and knows that a nightclub is a pretty questionable place to trip (security, bouncers, alcohol, claustrophobic sweaty indoor environment, huge amount of visual stimuli) yet still goes for it, believing that due to experience they can deal with all that, before being rudely awakened to reality. Just an extra thought.

3dszih	-59739	1437278706	Drugs	Weed and acid CEVs	For me the closed eye visuals you get on acid are very different to those I get now with weed (post-tripping). With acid, it's more like I can feel the images inside my head but they are somehow behind my eyes, I can see them but it's not 'seeing' with my eyes in the traditional sense. The images are abstract and difficult to control, but take on foreign elements I've never seen before and resemble people but nothing you would ever see on earth. With weed, the images are much more vivid in the sense that I am 'seeing' them as one would normally see, they seem to be in front of my eyes and I can easily focus on them like you would focus in the real world. The visuals are also far easier to control, in that I can think hard about an object or something and then see it inside my head. When I'm mildly stoned, the visuals are just patterns and look like a mosaic. When I'm baked out of my mind these form full scenes, however much more interestingly, these visuals seem to draw more upon real life and I'll often rewatch snippets of movies inside my head or look at the faces of people I recognise. On acid, nothing I see ever seems to draw upon real life. Interestingly, the visuals from weed also tend to cross from being CEVs to OEVs. It starts when I blink and get a flash of some kind of fractal pattern, then as it hits me harder I start seeing the CEVs laced over my normal vision, flashing on and off. It's quite distinctive and I always know when the visuals start even when my eyes are open. Does anyone else find similar distinctions between the two sets of visuals? I think they are both quite different but equally good in their own right. 
3eb1hp	-59739	1437645424	Drugs	My theory on the neural workings of a psychedelic experience.	So I highly doubt I'm the first one to think of this but I haven't seen anything similar online. About two weeks ago there was an AMA on /r/psychonaut from a guy with a degree in neuroscience and his explanation of the way certain optical illusions work on the brain was what prompted this idea. I'm currently studying psychology which helps my understanding of neuroscience a little too.  You know those optical illusions where you look at the dot for 30 seconds then look away, and get little acid-like visuals for about 5 seconds? [If you don't know what I mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSU3I4suLNQ). I think everyone has seen them before. Well, I believe that the reason these visuals are so reminiscent of psychedelic visuals is because they are one and the same, just brought about by different means. If I try to paraphrase the explanation I'll probably screw it up, so here I'll just paste it here:&gt;What actually happens is at a certain point in processing motion, you'll have, say a Left motion and Right motion neuron for a given part of the visual field, and those will go into another layer of neurons that compares the firing of the left and right neuron, and will decide if left or right motion is taking place depending on which is firing at a greater rate, because all neurons randomly fire at a certain baseline rate.&gt;Neurons do a thing, when you stimulate them a lot, they get sensitized and fire less frequently for a time. This is why you don't really feel the clothes on your skin or why the sound of your laptop fan doesn't really bother you. So this is what's going on in your motion-detecting neurons. You're repeatedly stimulating the ones going in a given direction for the visual area, and they get tired, and fire less. When you look away from the movement, those neurons start firing below baseline, registering as movement in the opposite direction, and without anything actually going anywhere. Despite this, you are conscious of movement occurring. This is really cool, because it tells us that location and movement are processed independently of one another.My hypothesis is that as a result of the psychedelics binding to certain neurotransmitters in our brain, the rate at which our neurons fire is distorted. Misfiring neurons perfectly explain why you can see walls breathing, and other similar visuals because we can already observe it through the optical illusions. I think the difference between psychedelics and common illusions is that psychedelics don't just screw up the firing rate of 'left motion' and 'right motion' neurons, they screw up the firing rate of neurons all over our brains. Each time you think or do something, neural impulses fire along the neural pathways in our brain, which are in turn strengthened. This leads to us getting stuck in certain ways of thinking about something, because a neural impulse generally follows the strongest pathway because it has the least resistance. If our neurons are firing at different rates, however, the impulse is just as likely to go down a completely different neural pathway that may not have been used for years or years at all. This is why you associate things in strange ways when tripping (e.g. thinking about how the walls care for you, look after you and keep the roof above your head). So basically, misfiring neurons in the primary visual cortex explain the visuals we get, and misfiring neurons in other parts of the brain are responsible for the mindfuck. There are plenty of things you can extrapolate from this, like that the misfiring inhibits the hippocampus and that is why it is extremely hard to consolidate most of your memory from a trip into long term memory, yet doesn't affect the amygdala which is why you still feel all the emotional implications of the epiphanies you can't remember. I'm not sure how far the theory extends, or if this is a well known thing. But I really do think that the differing rates that neurons fire at plays a big part in why we have a 'trip', unlike other drugs, which create purely physiological chemical highs. If you think this theory has any merit I recommend doing some research on neural communication / neural pathways etc because my shitty explanation really doesn't do it justice. **Edit:** This is just my opinion and I'm certainly open to being proven wrong – just hoping to facilitate some interesting discussion
3ene2p	-59739	1437907866	Drugs	2C-B as an MDMA replacement?	Obviously I know this is how 2C-B gained popularity in the first place, but after trying 20mg of 2C-B with weed yesterday I can't see why I'd ever want to roll ever again. The euphoria was better to ease into and not as pushy as MDMA but as soon as I smoked it got going and I just felt this amazing euphoria wash over me and the visuals were some of the strongest I have ever gotten. It will never replace 'true' psychedelics since it is all visuals/euphoria and no headspace (the most important part), but it seems like the perfect alternative to MDMA. People always talk about MDMA losing it's magic, having a comedown, using it only every 2-3 months, etc.. Do these still apply to 2C-B? Is it addictive/neurotoxic? Should one leave 2-3 months in-between doses? Does it ever lose the magic? Are there any safety concerns? Other than the love aspect, what does MDMA have on 2C-B? Do you guys like it? Why/why not?
3evm1i	-59739	1438073739	Drugs	I just tried to convince someone on Facebook that not all drugs were addictive. He didn't seem to understand.	I found a few strange groups related to drugs on Facebook and decided to join up to see how deeply wrong they were. One of the funnier group names was – in full capitals – &gt; PARENTS UNITE IN PRAYER AGAINST DRUGS AND THE DRUGDEVILSThis particular group had nearly 4500 members. The common thing to see among these groups, I have found, is an unnatural obsession with God. This is the transcript of some of the comments exchanged between myself and the group admin of "Drug Education", which has over 2500 members, following his post about what to do when your teenager is addicted to drugs. &gt;What if the teen is not addicted then?.&gt;Tom then you go on your knees and thank GOD that 'the teen' is NOT on drugs.&gt;What I mean is, what if they are on drugs, but not addicted? You talk about addiction as if there is no way to take drugs without getting addicted..&gt;There is NO WAYS that ANY person can take drugs on a continual basis and NOT get addicted to it. Yes some people are more prone to addiction than others. but WHY oh WHY do you wnat to dance with the devil ?? Talk to any addict or any one who has been freed from addiction and they WILL asure you that they NEVER thought that they would become addicted.&gt;That statement is factually incorrect. Around 90% of people who take drugs recreationally are not addicted. I agree that when you dabble in meth/heroin/cocaine it is a very slippery slope that will generally lead to addiction, however there are many, many drugs which exhibit no addictive properties whatsoever. This means that it is not possible to be physiologically addicted to many drugs, leaving only psychological addiction, which can be mitigated or entirely avoided with responsible use..&gt;Tom you are talking utterly nonsense. What you are saying is a lie from the pit of hell my friend. This sounds like the words of a drug dealer to me.... That is the kind of nonsense they would like people to believe..&gt;Is science nonsense? I am simply helping to unhinge some of the common misconceptions regarding drug use. If this page is not open to scientific fact regarding these substances then it's name should be changed from "Drug Education" to "Drug Propoganda".&gt;Tom you profile seems to be false... This makes me believe that you are in fact only here to cause problems and spread lies. You will be blocked.&gt;Unable to post comment. Try AgainWhy are humans so stupid?
3f0ml3	-59739	1438169757	atheism	Atheist philosophies / Churches	I read something online about the Church of Satan and initially though that it must have been some kind of counterculture hate group, similar to the Westboro Baptist Church. But I was intrigued about what they believed so I ended up doing some reading. I don't know if you guys know about Satanism or how much you know about it, but if you don't, it's basically an Atheist philosophy that celebrates the carnal nature of men/animals. Satanists do not believe in a theistic representation of Satan, or any Gods at all, but instead wholeheartedly reject the notion of a deity and choose to worship oneself as their own personal 'God'. Instead of emphasising morals, restraint and obedience like most religions, Satanism is about independence, pride, self-empowerment and indulgence. The reason they associate Satan is because they interpret Satan to mean *the opposer to religion* and there are various biblical stories that depict actions of free-thinking, disobedience (independence) and personal judgement as 'evil' and the work of Satan (such as picking the Apple from the Tree of Knowledge). Satanists generally have right wing political views because essentially the philosophy celebrates the role of the individual.I don't necessarily subscribe to this philosophy myself, but I find it very intriguing to read about and it does ring true to me in a lot of ways. I am an atheist and despite my terrible explanation, Satanism is about accepting that we are just animals and it is up to us to both enjoy and succeed in life, not some 'higher being' that we must bow down to. I also found a similar Church that had been founded by ex-satanists, Temple of Set, however they actually believed in Set (the Egyptian God of Disorder/Violence) as a literal entity unlike the Church of Satan, who simply saw Satan as a symbol of pride and freedom, which turned me off from them. So my question is, are there many of these kinds of Churches around? I find it really interesting to read about them but I can't find any more other than CoS and ToS. What others are there?

3ff5ew	-59739	1438447511	Drugs	It finally happened	I finally broke through with acid today where reality broke down in front of my open eyes and I became fully immersed in the experience. Each time before this it's been trippy OEVs, strange thought patterns and cool CEVs but this was the first time I *believed* what I was seeing. Now all my previous acid trips seem so trivial and I've finally seen what it's like "on the other side" a la a breakthrough.  Getting really stoned while tripping seems to make a huge differenceEdit: I didn't really elaborate because I don't really know how to articulate what I saw and I don't think it would make a very good trip report. I took 330ug and started smoking heavily about an hour into the peak. Walking around the botanical gardens of my city I started to get really strangely distorted vision of my arms (like minecraft when you set the POV back further) and everything I looked had a really cartoony look. I looked at the joint in my hand and it looked like a lego piece and I thought it had become made of plastic but I was okay with that. My perception of 3D space was heavily distorted and everything became cardboard pop-ups from a story book, inluding my hands, moving along a 3D plane with me in the middle. I had no idea who or what I was, nor where I was (I was lost) and I didn't know what I was doing, but I was okay with that.
3g40b9	-59739	1438938881	Dell	What is the user experience for the XPS range like outside of what they say in reviews?	I've been using a Macbook Pro 13" for the last 4 years (previously used Windows before that, but was forced away due to terrible school bloatware and restrictions) and I wanted to get a really nice high end laptop before I go back to college, so I kind of assumed I'd end up getting the Retina Macbook Pro 15". However seeing Windows 10 and realising that I won't have any of the old Windows issues has lured me back away from Apple (again, not trying to start a war) so I started looking for good premium alternatives to the rMBP. The Dell XPS range seems to be the only Windows laptops that compare with the premium feel of the rMBP instead of aiming for more mid-range budget consumers. Is this really the case, or is this just the Dell marketing? The reviews are all fantastic, but I'm really interested to hear what the actual user experience for these machines is like. I've got my heart set on the up and coming XPS 15" with infinity display. I think we can all agree that Apple makes terribly restrictive, overpriced and under-specced computers, but the result of this is a bulletproof user experience and hardware that works perfectly together. On the other hand it seems that Windows laptops always aim to throw together the highest specs for the cheapest price, which is good, but often results in cutting corners and hidden issues, as well as hardware that does not usually last that long. I know these are generalisations, but does the XPS line follow those trends or does it stray from them?
3gyois	-59739	1439549990	Drugs	MDMA on my birthday	I've only tried an empathogen once before, and I'm pretty sure it was 100mg of bk-mdma/methylone sold to me as Molly. It still gave me the the most intense euphoria I've ever experienced but I decided to lay off until I found some trustworthy MD through a friend. And that time has come. I bought two 100mg caps off my mate and I plan to roll on my 18th birthday when we all go out to a club. What's the best way to make use of my 200mg? Should I take all 200 at once? Bump throughout the night? If so, how much and how often? Should I just take 100mg and save the other cap for a later occasion? What do you guys recommend?I'm a reasonably big guy (6'3", 100kg), but the single cap of methylone really knocked me on my ass for the night, so I'm not sure how much this matters.

3iav8g	-59739	1440483158	Drugs	Is it worth trying to fight nasty comedowns?	I'm currently on the 3rd day of an MDMA binge comedown. I know it's a bitchy thing to whine about, and that there are far, far worse comedowns out there, but right now it really sucks. I've been fortunate enough to never experience any form of depression in my life, neither natural nor chemical, since I generally don't get comedowns or hangovers very badly, so when I started getting really depressed on this comedown it kind of hit me by surprise.I like to think of myself as being a pretty positive and optimistic guy, and I can generally talk myself into a good state of mind whatever circumstances I'm in. But not now. I have this overwhelming sense that all my friends hate me, I looked like a dickhead on the weekend, etc etc, even when logically I know it isn't true. But I can't seem to talk myself out of it like normal. So my question: is it worth trying to mentally fight off the depression/bad comedown by trying to stay in a positive mindset or should I just give up, wail in self pity for a few days then get back on my feet? How do you guys deal with a bad comedown? This is all pretty new to me, and I think the fact that I can't talk myself out of this mindset is part of why I feel worse right now.
3ib7wx	-59739	1440492535	Drugs	Which drug do you recommend for a Tame Impala concert?	I'm about to buy tickets for a recently announced Tame Impala concert in November. There's been plenty of posts here about the band and lots of trip reports from their concerts, so I figured this was a good place to ask. My friends and I can't decide what to take – 2C-B, MDMA, LSD, candyflip or something else? I feel like acid might be a little too introspective/full on, but I want to take a proper psych since this is a psychedelic rock band (i.e. not molly) so 2C-B or candy flipping seem like good options right now. Thoughts?

(This question cannot be easily googled)I've taken 20mg of 2C-B once before and smoked during it and it was the most phenomenal experience – stronger visuals than what I've been able to achieve on 300ug of LSD and a comparable body high/euphoria to MDMA. My friends and I are all going to a club this weekend and they are all rolling, but I rolled like two weeks ago so I'd rather take something else like 2C-B. I'm pretty experienced with psychedelics, so I should be able to handle myself, but I've never done them in a clubbing environment before. Firstly, is it a bad idea to take 2C-B in these circumstances? Secondly, obviously MDMA is usually cut with amphetamines or some other stimulant to help you dance longer. The guy (a close friend of mine) has both caffeine and d-amphetamine, which he offered to mix in with the 2C-B. Would mixing one of these be similar to ecstasy or would it kill the experience? If so, should I mix it with caffeine or speed? Thanks friends

1ojvvd	-59806	1381895728	atheism	Religious group attempts to remove art from city park.	In the city of Overland Park, KS, there is a city park called the Arboretum and Botanical Gardens. In this park is a trial/garden called the "international sculpture garden". It is home to many statues and sculptures from artists around the world. Among these sculptures is a nude [statue](http://www.pitch.com/imager/this-statue-might-cause-you-to-scream-woah-or-not/b/original/3972846/e1fc/1337965208-qz3ij_sm.jpg) that has attracted [attention](http://www.pitch.com/FastPitch/archives/2013/09/30/with-nothing-better-to-do-religious-zealots-make-another-run-at-overland-park-arboretum-statue). A religious group called the American Family Association of Kansas and Missouri is trying to have the work of art removed from the Arboretum because of it's nudity. To do this, a petition of about 4,000 must be signed, and the issue will be taken to the council. It is said that in some Christian churches, they are just "passing around a petition for people to sign" without anyone actually knowing what they are signing or having even seen the statue. I'm not sure if r/atheism is the right place for this post, but I am an atheist and I was wondering what the rest of reddit thought about it!Here are some more links:[The AFA petiton](http://www.change.org/petitions/overland-park-city-council-remove-the-inappropriate-sculpture-at-the-overland-park-arboretum)[Another article](http://www.kansascity.com/2013/09/29/4513194/critics-of-bare-breasts-on-overland.html)

28xino	-59806	1403577209	askscience	Does changing the pressure of a gas alter its temperature?	This could be a physics or chemistry question, but I'll go with chem because that is what I am more familiar with.My understanding of gases is based off of ideal gas laws that I learned in chem class. I'm going to refer to PV=nRT and try to use it to help me understand. So when solved for temperature, you'll have T=PV/(nR). Mathematically, you can alter P and T with change with a direct relation. However, to change P, you how to change either n or V (as far as I know, there aren't many ways to change pressure other than adding more matter to a container of a fixed volume, changing the temperature, or changing the volume). To look at this from a chemistry perspective, changing the pressure (or how often the molecules run into each other and the container they are in) does not increase the temperature or avg. kinetic energy. Nor does adding more of the gas or altering the volume.The reason I am wondering this is because I was just wondering how my refrigerator worked. Looking it up on the internet only led me to this question. The way it is explained (or at least how I am interpreting it - perhaps I am just misunderstanding how refrigerators work) makes it sound like vaporized (supposedly cooler) gas is pumped into the refrigerator, and when it exits it is compressed, becoming warmer. That warm fluid is run in pipes that go outside of the refrigerator, expelling heat from inside.Sorry for the long post!

If I want to base the value of one cell off of the value of another, how could I do that? For example, if B2 has a value of "Primary", I want C2 to have a value different than if B2 has a value of "Secondary". "Primary" and "Secondary" are the only options for the value of B2, and I want to make C2 dependent on that value.

I am a high school band member from Kansas, and we just had our coldest rehearsal of the year so far (it wasn't nearly as cold as it will get, but it was 55 degrees F, so it was enough to slow your finders down). My band director doesn't like to hear us say anything about the cold, or doesn't like us to use the cold as an excuse for anything. He always says something like "In places like Minnesota, it's cold for the whole marching season. So you can handle this." I don't disagree with this; cold rehearsals are just something we have to deal with. But, I was curious - about how cold does a rehearsal have to be up north for it to be called off, or for you to be sent inside? How do you deal with colder rehearsals? How much does the cold affect your average rehearsal?Thanks!

I just subscribed to this sub because I have no where else to ask this question, and I figured you all might be able to help me out. I recently got my Nexus 6 with Sprint as my carrier. As you probably know, if you want to tether/hotspot without paying for the plan from your carrier, you have to mess with some files. So I OEM unlocked and rooted y phone, changed settings and build files. I got the hotspot to work, but for some reason, USB tethering will not. Let me clarify: the option is available on my phone, and I can turn it on. However, my Windows 8.1 PC does not respond to this. When I had my GS4, I installed CM11 and I was able to hook up my USB and tether right away - no problems. This led me to believe that it was not a drivers issue with windows, but rather a setting issue with my Nexus 6. Had anyone had the same/similar issue, or does anyone know how to help me? Thanks!

I saw somewhere else that someone had the same problem, but they had made no changes other than rooting (I had to edit files for tethering). He fixed his problem unrooting using SuperSu. Do I need to worry about the files I edited to do that? Do I even need to unroot?

3aw3bi	-59806	1435102837	backpacking	New to backpacking!	Hello backpackers and hikers! I am thinking about starting to backpack long distance, but I really have no idea what I'm getting myself in to. I was hoping that some of you might be kind enough to give me some advice or tips!I'm currently 18 years old (a male) and I'm gong of to college this year. But I thought that next summer would be a good time start  a solo trip. I have never been backpacking before, but I have done something similar. For a few years now my dad and I have gone to the BWCA to canoe and camp (as well as carry packs, although a much, much shorter distance). I'm not completely uneducated on gear and lingo, but I'm certainly not very experienced. I wanted to start with the Super Hiking Trail because it's relatively short, it's a nicely marked trail, and I know a little bit of what to expect from weather/wildlife/terrain. I don't really own any *backpacking* gear, but I do have packs, a tarp, food storage, clothes that (I think) would be suitable, and tools. However, none of this stuff is meant to be light weight.After the SHT, I would like to do the Appalachian Trail and maybe even the PCT. But those are a long ways off! I would appreciate any tips or thoughts! I am in over my head? What should I expect?

3gdbt1	-59806	1439142869	askscience	What causes Uranium 235 to fission?	So I understand that U235 is unstable and has a half life of millions of years. I understand that to fission it absorbs a neutron, and in doing so emits 3 more as well as a gamma ray and two other radioactive particles. But I was just reading up on wikipedia and read this:"Uranium-235 has a half-life of 703.8 million years. It was discovered in 1935 by Arthur Jeffrey Dempster. Its (fission) nuclear cross section for slow thermal neutrons is about 584.994 barns. For fast neutrons it is on the order of 1 barn.[1] Most but not all neutron absorptions result in fission; a minority result inneutron capture forming uranium-236."What I do not understand is how not all neutron absorptions result in fission. Initially I thought that U236 was just very unstable and had a tiny tiny tiny half life. But, U236 also has a half life of many many years. So my question is, why will U235 sometimes absorb a neutron to form U236 and not fission? Why does it not fission every time? And why is it more likely for a slow neutron to make it fission than a fast one?

But I have recently turned 18, allowing me to vote. To be able to cast an educated, reasonable vote, I need to stay updated on the import things. And that brings me to my question: how do you get your news; how do you know it's reliable; what are your favorite sites; how do you keep it all organized...? I would greatly appreciate any tips, and I'm sure others could learn from this too!

Long story short, didn't lose a lot of money on this one, more like i just didnt get away with a cool mistake. But i went to a concert the other night and drank 3 beers, cashed my tab out (bar tender was in a huge hurry cashing everyone out at once) and only charged me $0.13 instead of $13, so i thought "cool" and signed the receipt with a line through the tip section (i dropped a 5 in the bucket).however, today i checked my bank statement and the charge went from $0.13 yesterday to $13 today, my only question is if it is legal for them to change the charge after i put my signature on the receipt for $0.13Thank you!

16comi	-59831	1357868668	firstimpression	Some examination of gender in r/firstimpression	I really enjoy this subreddit and I have noticed some trends and I did a little random sampling to test my hypotheses.  The variance in responses to posts by gender is probably significant.  I took a random sample of 65 posts by Men and 65 posts by women, discounting posts by non-normative gendered folks or posts that are not actually asking for first impressions.  The average number of responses for posts by Men for my sample is 7.98 comments, while the average number of comments for posts by Women in my sample is 13.94.  Keeping in mind that I am a bit lazy and didn’t take huge sample sizes, it would seem that there is a significant difference here.  To add to this another casual trend in the data is that Men’s posts tend to have a smaller deviation from this mean, with a relatively normal curve (excluding some outliers in the mid-twenties), while posts by women tended to have a lot more outliers of posts either in the mid to high-thirties or comments numbering 3 or below (more of a bi-modal distribution).  I’m not entirely sure what sort of conclusions can be drawn from this but it seems that some women’s posts are completely ignored while others have a relatively large number of comments.  It also seems that Men’s posts are rarely very popular or very unpopular.	In addition to this I examined the top 22 posts, this obviously cannot be used to claim statistical significance but it was interesting to look at nonetheless.  Of the top 22 posts, 8 were men, 11 were women and 3 were either non-normatively gendered or not really suitable data (i.e. horsemask).  This again, cannot be used to say any sort of statistical significance, but it would seem that there is not much difference between the likelihood of a Man or Woman to be in the top posts on this subreddit.	Hope y’all find this interesting, I find it important to check out gender trends in my activities to check possible prejudices, or weird effects of gender.

1b3dgf	-59831	1364359381	radicalqueers	Anyone want to have a conversation about why maybe gay marriage isn't something to get all that excited about?	Today we have gay folks seeking marriage "rights" by saying that "we can be normal just like straight people." This still means that anyone who doesn't simulate the American white picket fence and two and a half kids thing just gets fucked harder, because marriage as a normative institution is strengthened by its inclusion of the "good gays" into it. This "new" type of marriage within rigidly defined identifiable limits does nothing to threaten those structures which created "the homosexual" as different in the first place.  Marriage, as an institution (or dispositif if y'all like that word) continues to reinforce gender, the subjugation of women, compulsory monogamy, poverty, alienation due to the family unit, etc., and forces the relationships between people into the dominion of the state.  Just like what occurred with the depathologizing of homosexuality there is a portion of people who can find themselves marginally better off because of "progress" however the assimilation into these structures based off some further establishment and naturalizing of *différance* is productive in the strong sense, it produces a new subject of and to power.  A normalizing force only possible through the assertion of the other as aberrant.  The gay who did gender correctly was able to no longer be subject of pathology, however what arose was a new diagnosis of "gender identity disorder."  Those who could pass as straight in ever way but who they fucked could be normal too, everyone else became even more screwed, and the complexities of the heterosexual matrix redoubled.I cannot predict exactly what the product of legalizing gay would be, however I can say that the fact that it has been the prominent issue for a lot of folks is a mistake.  It does not indicate a step toward equality, just another layer in the simulacra of the real human, another reinforcement for normative structures and the state.Sure the homosexual relationship no longer finds itself in the place of the hyper-subjugated exclusion, but being normalized also means it has lost any potentiality of becoming a subjectivity (or non-subject, I'm not sure) capable of rupturing power.  And has simply taken a step up within the systems of power that create, define, restrict, etc.
1c2ljl	-59831	1365611938	nihilisms	If you claim a nihilist identity you've accepted defeat, you are working on assumed meanings.	So, if we take nihilism to mean a negation of meaning, so this would encompass moral nihilism, political nihilism, etc.  Then claiming a nihilist identity is the acceptance and reinforcing of meanings.  I am not going to argue that the nihilist identity in and of it itself is an embracing of meaning, a total negation is not the same sort of restriction as a productive (even negative) dialectic, it leaves only absence/nothingness.  But rather I would argue that by claiming "I am a nihilist" you are working on the foundation of a coherent subject, a self which can only exist as a result of constructed meaning.If we had no way through which to understand people, to make people socially intelligible, then we could not describe people as such, we could not be said to "exist."  This argument applies to the self, the idea of a coherent self which does things cannot exist without its definitional limits, it is the case of the signifier creating the signified.  If we did not have divisions with simulated meanings that have become naturalized we could not have these subjects as such.  Without black/white,  man/woman, female/male, et cetera, we could not have any way through which to understand the liberal subject, or the subject in general.  If we cannot name it, cannot talk about it, if it does not exist in discourse, if it has not been produced, it does  not exist.This argument leads us to the idea that the self does not exist outside of social systems of meaning.  The self has a history, it is not an essential quality of life, or an essential quality of human (as if human were essential...).  So by laying stake to a self, by claiming "I am" an individual reinforces these forces which created the self, created intelligible bodies, and then looked at their creation for their validation as natural/essential.  This recursion allowed this simulation of meaning to become endlessly self-referential, it is only self-referential, becoming a simulacra.  It is true in a sense and not in a sense.Nothing can be said to exist without meaning.TL;DR: I do not exist.

1csaqg	-59831	1366520972	DebateaCommunist	Does it really matter if something is "bourgeois" or not?	I'm relatively new to this sub but I keep seeing posts discussing whether certain actions within Capitalism are bourgeois or not/who counts as bourgeoisie and who doesn't.  It is my opinion that this should not be the focus of a critical view of Capitalism or of a revolutionary project.  It isn't that one's relation to Capital does not matter, rather that it isn't destiny and the important factor is whether or not someone is willing to fight/give up their place within Capitalism.  If someone is born monied or even has exploited others for their own gain should that stop communists from joining with them if they are willing to fight Capitalism?It seems to me that the categories of bourgeois and proletariat can be useful for an analysis of the functioning of Capital (though this dichotomy misses a lot of the nuance of advanced global Capitalism), but it isn't really useful in creating a post-Capitalist world.  The unity assumed for the proles is a shared exploitation and oppression by the ruling class.  It seems that seeking anything other than the abolition of the classification of prole is standing in the way of removing the power that category holds.  If we rally around proletarian identity we still need to stop being the proletariat in order to stop being restricted.The assertion that the proletariat as a class has a revolutionary potential is assuming this unity, and assuming this unity makes it so that revolutionary projects focus on building unity rather than building opposition to Capitalism.  I guess this argument is similar to the argument against traditional Feminism by Butler in the beginning of *Gender Trouble*.  I'm just curious what y'all think about this.
1fqbpx	-59831	1370451316	nihilism	A discussion not worth having, that we keep having, that I am sick of having. Who is a "real nihilist?"	So I see this happen on this sub a lot, pretty much every thread there is someone who comes here trying to "prove" to everyone else that either no one, or at least no one on this sub is a "true nihilist" or "real nihilist."  First off these people will rarely define what they mean by nihilist and why people do not live up to that definition.  Recently this anti-nihilist claim was "supported" by someone saying "a true nihilist can't even get out of bed."  On that same post it seems OP came here expecting to find people out as not nihilists.  There was another recent post pointing to a CMV post where the poster on CMV was claiming to be a nihilist and OP on this sub was saying we should all go laugh because they weren't really a nihilist.  There was another post a few weeks ago that was attempting to trap people here into saying they weren't nihilists by asking a rhetorical question then putting people into theoretical boxes based off of an understanding of theory gleaned seemingly solely from wikipedia.  I am very, very, very sick of all of this.If being a nihilist to you means that a nihilist must find that nothing is worth doing, that nothing matters, rather than some critique of objective (or even subjective) meanings or values, then I suggest you may want to read some Nietzsche or some Stirner instead of taking your definition from Wikipedia or *The Big Lebowski.*  If this is what nihilism means to you, fine, but that is not what it is to others and continually having people post on this reddit attacking the possibility of their own definition of nihilism rather than trying to have an interesting discussion on the topic is getting annoying.Can we have this be a place for a discussion of nihilist theory?  For a discussion of what nihilism is to us?  A place to give book suggestions?  A place to debate nihilism without simply resorting to "you arent **really** a nihilist" claims?I reject the idea that there can be objective meaning, objective "good" and "evil," or really objective existence as existence is bound by meaning.  I believe that everything intelligible is a discursive production of power on an absence that pre-dates everything and back to which everything can be deconstructed.  That does not mean that I reject the "real world," necessarily, that I can somehow work outside of the "real world," it just means that I question the meaning and essentialness of reality.  The theory I write and discuss (on reddit or otherwise) is influenced heavily by classical nihilists, please stop trying to tell me "gotcha you aren't really a nihilist" (I don't identify as a nihilist anyway, I do like nihilism though) because I don't believe what you think I should believe with your own definition of nihilism.  It is a totally useless discussion and it is very frustrating.If people want to have a sub to tell people that they aren't really nihilists then I suggest someone make /r/ohnoyoudidntsaynihilist or something like that, where you can have that discussion over and over to your heart's content.

If this isn't the correct place for this discussion it would be great if y'all could point me in the right direction.I had a thought today, more identity theory than anything practical, and I would like to hear any discussion of it.  I was thinking about radical-left discourse on questions of race and gender and had a thought.  Pretend for a minute if you don't, that you believe both gender and race are social productions/discursive productions/simulacra/deconstructable/whatever.  Generally queer theory, in discussion of "trans" people argues that either because gender divisions are not essential or because we should seek to transgress divisions that the changing of one's gender from that decided at birth is relatively unproblematic.  Other than the possibility that this change serves to reenforce gender divisions I pretty much agree with the idea that anyone should be able to do what they will with their bodies, that it is unproblematic for a person who was made to be a boy is a woman (or whatever rejection and subsequent acceptance of different genders) without any need to provide a "reason" for this desire.So I began to think about how my gender politics relate to my racial politics.  I feel that race is equally as unreal, as much of a social construction, and so on as gender.  However when I hear of a white person who wishes to say "I am not white" or that they are not in any way responsible for the privileges which they enjoy it makes me quite angry.  If I were to see a white person who changed their body, their affect, et cetera in order to look like they were black it would seem odd.  In addition any presentation this person took up to act "black" would be racist.So I ask, why would an argument for trans-racialism be any less valid than an argument for gender transition?  I've been thinking about this for a while and I can't quite come up with a good reason for my different treatments of these equally garbage categories.  It isn't like one is less restrictive, it isn't like we can quantify a greater effect one has had on the world or on our own identity production.I personally think that this may just be an unavoidable contradiction in maneuvering within identities rather than attempting to destroy/deconstruct them.  I would love to hear people's thoughts on this conundrum.

I just thought that this difference in our discourse might warrant investigation or might allow us to explore an interesting difference between these constructions.

20dmxk	-59831	1394770189	AskHistorians	How similar are the American drug selling gangs of the 1990s and the 2000s to the alcohol selling gangs in the 1920s and early 1930s?	I'm sorry if this has been asked here before.  I'm curious if there are any similarities in group structure, activities, et cetera between the gangs selling liquor during the 1920s and early 1930s in the United States (the Capones or something like that) and the gangs selling drugs during the 1990's and the 2000's (Crips and similar gangs).

22r7mg	-59831	1397191619	lawschooladmissions	I'm not sure where I should apply to law schools or if I should apply at all. Help?	If this is the wrong place for this let me know and I'll take it down.I am graduating with my undergraduate from a relatively uncompetitive public university in May.  I went to this school because I thought I was going to be a high school math teacher (nope) and the education program here is renowned; ended up switching majors to political science in my second year, with a legal option after the third.  I've got debt, but not an insurmountable amount.  I paid my phi beta kappa dues and I took a practice LSAT the other day and got a 165 and I plan on taking a class or something in preparation for taking the real LSAT in June.  My work history is almost entirely for-cash construction work.  The only experience I have anywhere near law is high school mock trial, but I am trying to get work in a law office for the next year (I don't intend to go to law school until the fall of 2015). My extra  curricular activities aren't that impressive, I was an officer for a couple of political student organizations, and I have some community organizing experience.If I got a JD I would want to practice civil rights law,  criminal defense, or labor/worker's compensation law.  I had thought about possibly trying to get a PhD after the JD but I don't think I want to be in school that long.  What I don't know is what schools I should be considering applying to, I have a meeting set up with a campus lawyer to talk with them and another with a professor coming up but I thought I would see what y'all internet strangers have to say.I don't know what else I would do, I've done well in my undergraduate law classes, I like constructing legal arguments, I love debate, and I really love critical legal theory.I don't want to be in boatloads of debt, I don't want to have my options limited by needing to make enough money to pay off huge loans, I don't know if I will be able to get into a school that would be worthwhile and/or get a job in any of the fields I'm interested in.  Help?
27tdru	-59831	1402431126	DebateNihilisms	Is there meaningful interplay between the many different nihilisms?	What I mean by this is, for example, do you think that asserting that morals are baseless self-reference necessitates the same assertion about other phenomenon?If you embrace existential nihilism, do you believe moral nihilism follows?If one embraces the assertion that knowledge is not objective, epistemological nihilism, then what is the division that stops you from embracing mereological nihilism?I would basically like to hear what whoever shows up here thinks of different nihilisms and what they mean to you, as well as what them mean to other nihilisms.

384zih	-59839	1433196426	DarkTales	Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night	 My daughter was born with a crooked back.  When she was three our family doctor had said it was a form of scoliosis and she was likely to outgrow it by the time she reached adolescence.  My wife and I decided to go along with the doctor’s plan to put her in a back brace so her spine would straighten as she grew older.  She did not complain about the itching until she was five.  She said she felt as though ants were crawling up her back.  As many times as I checked her skin for a rash, I never found anything.  One time my wife caught her using a spatula from the kitchen drawer to itch beneath her brace.  This itching stopped by the time she was ten.  However, she began complaining about back pain and began suffering from intense bouts of insomnia, brought about by her inability to find a comfortable sleeping position.  When she did sleep she was awakened at first by nightmares, but by the time she was twelve they had become night terrors.  Her screaming often woke the neighbors.  We thought it was because of her lack of sleep that she turned away from bright light and kept the curtains drawn before her bedroom windows.  We became increasingly concerned as we noticed she had recurring bouts of sleepwalking, always exiting the house through the kitchen door and wandering into the woods behind our property.  My wife and I began following her in the early hours of each morning, even as the frost grew around our ankles.  She would always stop in the middle of a small clearing, awaken, and then would ask to be walked home.  She was too old for her willful subconscious to be fooled by locks at this point, so each morning we repeated the same routine.  As she entered her early teens and her pain seemed to grow worse each day, her doctor referred her to a specialist to perform surgery in order to alleviate her suffering.  Her complaints about pain became oddly infrequent during the week before this operation, she even slept a solid eight hours on one or two occasions.  That was, until the morning she was scheduled to go into the hospital.  I, myself, had been having a difficult week of sleep, my nerves on edge due to the constant doctor appointments and accepting the fact that my only child’s agony would not be relieved until she underwent this surgical procedure.  On the morning of her surgery, as I lay awake in bed, I heard the screen door slam closed and I rose from bed, customarily following her into the woods.  As usual she went into the clearing, but I continued to watch her uneasily, even as she failed to turn around or speak.  “Roxy?”  I barely spoke into the darkness, breath barely visible in the moonlight.  I was startled when she dropped to her knees, screaming in anguish as black forms sprung from her back, enveloping her entire form until even her shouts were muffled by the black ooze.  I ran to her as she collapsed to the ground, tearing at the fibrous material, desperately trying to get to my child.  After a minute or so of trying to free her from the oily cocoon, I realized it would be impossible to free her without some sort of tool, so I sprinted home and grabbed a butcher knife from the kitchen drawer.  It had been only about three minutes since her entanglement, and I tore at her binding with the knife, slashing for what seemed like an eternity until the black fibers seemed to give in on their own, sinking to the forest floor to reveal my daughter’s broken form.  Her clothing bad been stripped from her thin frame and her eyes were sunken and grey.  Her arms had been crossed against her chest as though she were to be laid to rest.  But she was smiling.  A sick grimace had taken over my child’s face, seeming to brag that she was no longer in any pain.  I shook violently at the sight.My screams were loud enough to warrant the neighbors calling the police, and, to no surprise, the unusual circumstances of my daughter’s death remained a mystery to mere human eyes, even when the greatest of investigators insisted on seeing the scene years after she had perished.  I never knew who… what had sent my poor Roxanne to an early burial.  My wife and I moved to the city, far from any forest that could harm us and our family.  We have another daughter now, much healthier than the sister she never knew.  The other day she asked if she could attend a camping trip with her Girl Scouts troop, and it was with tears in my eyes that I told her why I could never allow her to do such a thing.  They talk of the great battles between man and nature, and I have come to the realization that man will not always be the sole victor.
386cvc	-59839	1433218354	DarkTales	Valentina's Machine	 As the organist played her final notes, the audience cheered and the curtains were drawn shut.  People restlessly rose from their seats and exited the theater at the rear of the hall, the house lights refracting off of the gold-colored pedestals and intricate molding that had surrounded them.  But the organist remained at her seat.  Sweet Valentina teetered where she sat, prepared to pass out from exhaustion at any moment.  I ran over to her, my job being to assure such a thing would never happen.  I handed her a glass of water and she hurriedly drank, her urgency leaving no room for grace in the act as the liquid dribbled from the corner of her mouth.  She whipped it away with one of her wrists, smearing her lipstick in the process.  I pulled a damp cloth from my satchel, cleaning her entire face of makeup.  She tried her best to look thankful, but her will could not cast away the dead stare her eyes had taken over the weeks.  “I don’t know how much longer I will last, my dear Sabine,” Valentina said, shaking the mahogany curls from where they had been carefully pinned to the top of her head.  I looked at her, but said nothing.    “Do not be afraid,” she replied to my silence, taking my hand that still clung to the soiled cloth.  I accepted her gesture, gripping her elbow with my free hand.  I lifted her to her feet as a couple of girls, several years my junior, brought out a large metal tub and, placing it next to the organ, began filling it with buckets of steaming water.  I undressed Valentina from her layers of silks, her bound ankle tying her closely to the mounted organ bench with a heavy steel chain the rattled as she stumbled with my assistance to her bath.   After sinking into the water, she was became ominously silent.  I was about to speak when she placed a finger against her lips.  “Do you hear that?”  A shutter banged high above the organ pipes within the theater.  A faint humming turned into a low, discordant pitch that reverberated through the cold night’s air.  “They have come early tonight,” she said, a barely audible whisper.I shook my head as Valentina tried to rise from her well-deserved bath.  I would play the machine.  “Your time will come, Sabine,” she said in an attempt to stop me, but I had already taken my place, not yet a slave to the bellowing behemoth that loomed meters above me.  I pressed the keys, the low, roaring sound filling the hall and drifting to the streets of the city beyond.  I played for several minutes, each note pulling at my heartstrings.  I could feel my chest rattle and my heart begin to break.I played not for the Organ Master who kept us to play his machine, nor for the city whose protection relied upon our servitude.  I played for my dear Valentina, a slow, sad melody.  I played for her ashen skin and sinking cheeks, her sloped stance and dying eyes.  I played for springs long since abandoned and summers that would never come.  I did not feel the tears on my cheeks until the last note faded from the now perfectly still air.By this point she had been helped from her bath by one of the girls who had fetched the tub.  She was wrapped in a towel now, thinner than I had ever remembered seeing her, but her eyes were ablaze for the first time since she had taken her place.  I walked to her and fell into her arms, no longer able to hold back the sobs, as she gently stroked my hair.“I understand,” she murmured into my ear, the other girls now having departed from us.  “But please take care.  It is a dangerous world out there for those like us.”They would come for me, and I would likely perish on the road I sought.  But in Valentina’s arms I decided that I would rather die a free death than one chained to the hideous contraption under which’s gaze we embraced in silence.After a wistful goodbye, I took my leave of her and the organ and the city that now sought my destruction.  A preserver, now turned against that which she was fashioned to protect.As I left the city, I could hear Valentina playing her melody of safeguarding, one I had known to be for the city, its horrid secrets unknown to nearly all of its citizens.  But I drew strength from that hymn, knowing it would be the last time I would hear its furious howls that had long since scared my heart into accepting my fate at its keys.  I knew she would play throughout the night and that she would be dead by morning.And I knew there were twenty other girls waiting to take her place.

He would always score copies of games for free and to this day my parents have a huge box in their garage full of 3DO games, many unopened. Next time I'm home I'll have to dig some out and relieve some memories of Need for Speed and Road Rash... Anyway that's all, just wanted to share.

1qyciz	-59866	1384834630	toronto	An idea to improve traffic: King and Queen Streets should be one way in opposite directions.	If King went west, and Queen went east (or the opposite) streetcars could divert more frequently onto the tracks currently on the other side of the road if one broke down.  Vehicles could park and make deliveries, and there would still be two lanes in the middle.  Even with a parked car, construction, and a broken street car, there would be an open lane.  Limit rush hour parking on top of that, wouldn't traffic flow a lot better?

I really like the shows I have been hearing and would love O&amp;J to move forward with it.  For the past year I have been getting a little tired of both HSS and O&amp;A, at least Anthony's vitriol.  It used to be a great edge to the show, but it had seemed to amp up a lot to the point they regularly burned half hours of air at a time with Rush Limbaugh style radio.  I stopped listening regularly as a result.  I hope they keep going with it and Opie makes Jim a full partner.  I like it, and I think they can turn it into something new and great.

How do they do Spamalot! one night, and Avenue Q, Evita, and Rocky Horror within a few weeks?    EDIT: Thanks all.  To summarize what I took away from the below: the LOT is an ambitious community theatre that would be great in almost any other city in Ontario, but happens to be in Toronto and 30%-50% overpriced because of all the great competition in town that is bigger/better or cheaper.    This comment stood out as the best advice, more or less what I wondered about in posting this question:&gt;"If you want to see RENT, then you should go and see the LOT's RENT, because it's the kind of show that young unpaid actors can do fairly well, and it's the kind of show that nobody else is going to produce, and the production'll be okay, and you'll walk out smiling.  &gt;But if you just want to see a show, I would encourage you to go elsewhere."Taken from and thanks to /u/adminbeast and their [tidy explanation](http://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/2nm0et/how_does_the_lower_ossington_theatre_have_so_many/cmesb9l) below.

So like in the title, mostly black and white cartoons we had on a viedo cassette. one part had little lulu in it. another part had loads of little animals having a lesson in a classroom. another part was about little boy blue and the wolf. another part was about something making people out of baloons and then the PINMAN (was a pin cushion with pins in him.) came and threw loads of pins at them trying to burst them. there was more with little kittens and everything. and fawns and dancing ballarina flowers! Now maybe these were all totally un related to each other, but we had them all on the same video so I thought they came together or something. any help on finding even one or two of these would be great! and thanks in advance!!!

A local, scalable and self sustaining business through a website that gives information on what we do and how we go about it. But I intend to tackle a separate field: Fitness. Instead of having a two man team for lawn service or housework, I'd like to send a two man team to provide a customized bodybuilding and/or cardiovascular personalized to the client's specific needs and ability. Any feedback for this? Would it be good business venture? I just discovered reddit, as well as this sub, and I've gotta say it's addicting! I can't get enough of it! All of your stories have really inspired me. I only discovered this subreddit this monday Dec. 2 and, by golly, you guys make me want to get up and do something myself! Also, any idea so that I could start charging the fee through a credit card right from the get go?

Hey GuysSo I'm about to start our channel, the capture card is working fantastic, our webcam is also set, the mic is shipping and will be arriving soon, our audio mixer is good to go, I have taken two semesters on Adobe Premiere so our editing should look up to par, and all our legacy consoles and games collection are ready for a beating! But right at the starting line, one of the hosts was hearing himself on our tests and he says that he thinks his voice might be annoying to the audience. Here's where I post my question: have any of you taken voice acting lessons or something of the like to have a great engaging voice for this? We've taken all the extra precautions to be able to post decent content to say the least, so we want to make sure the voices also sound good. I've read several books on the subject, like Alan Greene's "The New Voice", and have the Zen of Screaming dvds, and was considering having the hosts do voice warmups before we go full speed ahead. Any recommendations?

The reason I ask is because I want to buy gems for the neith skin etc but if like last year for example they had a gem sale around Christmas I would hold off buying gems now for the chance they'll have a sale soon. Tldr: Do you guys think there's a good chance there will be a gem sale around Christmas time or Not

On today’s canvas is the daily chart of the Euro Stoxx 50. for those who does not know, the Euro Stoxx 50 is a stock index of the 50 biggest blue-chip companies in the euro zone. Like the Dow of the US, the Stoxx 50 can also be used as a leading barometer of the euro zone’s economic health. Unlike the DAX (kindly see my colleague’s earlier post here), the Stoxx 50 is a couple of steps away from breaking down already. Its price action is actually very similar to FTSE, which my partner also posted earlier today (kindly check it here), since it is also showing a head and shoulders formation. But as mentioned, the Stoxx has not breached its neckline yet unlike the FTSE. If and when it breaks below the 2,200 level and the neckline, it could plunged all the way down 1,850. In fact, a couple of indicators suggest that it could indeed do so. First, the RSI has fallen below 50, suggesting that the index’s downward momentum is increasing. Second, the 50-day moving average has also crossed over below the 200-day MA, indicating a likely move downwards. Moreover, the MACD has also recently turned negative. On the upside, if buying interest returns and the neckline holds, the index could once again aim at least for the peak of its right shoulder. With the index now trading below the 50 and 200 MAs, however, it would need a lot of buying support to push itself upwards again.

As you can see, the index has retraced back to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level that I drew after reaching a high of 88.708 last June 7. Given its oversold conditions, the pair would probably head north soon. If the 50% Fib breaks, its long term uptrend line would be its immediate support. Now, if this uptrend gets broken, the index could slide down to around 82.00 or even further at 81.00. But as long as the uptrend remains intact, the index and the USD’s valuation against the other currencies would likely rise. More...
cmrqu	-59914	1278483628	reddit.com	A Chance to Ride the Global Gold Rush! – July 7, 2010 	Good day finance fans! Here’s an update on the price action of gold which I last posted on June 28 (kindly see my previous entry here). As you can see, the price of gold has weakened after it marked a new all-time high at $1,265.05 per ounce on June 21. Gold has a possibility to dip a little more since it has already broken its shorter term uptrend line. Despite doing so, its long term uptrend remains to be intact and as long as it is, the price of gold would likely trek higher over the longer time frame. With the stochastics in the oversold area, traders could indeed buy it back up any time soon. The presence of a bullish divergence, where the price registers higher highs and the stochastics mark lower lows, also suggest a likely bullish continuation in the coming days. In my opinion, a good long entry point here would be at the intersection of the 50% Fibonacci retracement level that I drew and the long term uptrend line. A break, however, of the long term uptrend line would be a sign of some sour things to come.

In my previous post about it (please see it here) last August 3, I mentioned that as long as its uptrend holds, it would continue to move higher… and it did. As you can see, the pair had consolidated into a symmetrical triangle after reaching a high of 1.3262 on August 3. It then broke out to the upside after finding support at the uptrend line. The presence of a hidden bullish divergence (where the price moves higher and the stochastics moves lower) and its oversold condition when it fell back to the uptrend support could have also led the investors to buy up the euro in exchange of the USD. Still, the pair is facing some heavy selling pressure at 1.3300. Given this, it might a harder time in moving above the mentioned level. It would more likely consolidate again or even retrace before it shoots up again. A break, however, of the uptrend line could push the EURUSD back to 1.3100. But since it is on an uptrend, a move higher is more likely to take place.

On today’s canvas is the 4-hour chart of the USDCAD  pair. As you can see, the pair has been trending south for the past month. After hitting a new 3-month low of 1.0107 on August 5, it then rallied strongly. At present, it is trading below 1.0300. A break above this could send it to 1.0350 or at 1.0400. However, it looks like the pair is experiencing some selling pressure at 1.0300. Interestingly, this mark almost falls in line with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement that I drew. Hence, if the pair is unable to break above the resistance at 1.0300, it could once again revisit its previous low at 1.0107.

Word on the street, Nihao is starting its first nickel shipment to China which probably propelled the stocks to move higher for the last two trading sessions. Shipments to Australia and Japan could also take place in the coming months according to the news clarification released by the company. As a result for yesterday’s trading session, its volume traded daily went to a 4-month high (indicated by the violet circle). High volume is a good thing since it adds more liquidity to the stocks thus buying and selling would be easier.

In today’s chart is an update of the US dollar index (USDX) that I presented the other day (please check it here). Back then the index was still moving within a descending channel. My thinking was, it would continue to move lower since the channel was still intact. The index, however, broke above the resistance of the channel in yesterday’s price action. Now, will it start to trade on higher ground? Maybe. However, it could still move south or sideways given the lack of a reversal pattern (double bottom, cup and handle, inverted head and shoulders,etc.). So if it weakens again, it could fall back to the 80.000 area. A potential bearish divergence, where the price moves lower and the stochastics move higher, suggests this possibility.

Last Friday, we the Canadian dollar rallied against the Japanese yen to push the CADJPY pair closer to where the former support of the triangle. In my view, there is still some room for the pair to move higher although it could turn back when it hits a resistance at this former support. If it does, it could fall back to around 78.60.
dc0qr	-59914	1284113563	reddit.com	Canadian Dollar Remains Weak Versus the Yen Despite BOC Rate Hike	Good day FX peeps! To cap the week I present to you an update of the CADJPY. You see, the pair has consolidated within a small symmetrical triangle after it broke down from a bigger descending triangle formation. As of the moment, the pair is already nearing the apex of symmetrical triangle. This suggests that a break out whether to the upside or to the downside is imminent. But given the pair’s general trend (downtrend) and its recent break down from a descending triangle formation, I can say that it has a higher chance of moving south than north. Even it breaks the resistance of the small triangle, a solid resistance is still present at the 82.00 marker which incidentally is also the former support of the previous descending triangle to push back down. In any case, a move below the support of the present triangle could send it back to the previous low at 78.41.

On today’s FX feature is an update of the AUDUSD pair which I posted last September 5 (please see it here). As you can see, the pair has continued to rise within an ascending channel. And as I’ve suggested, the pair indeed rose to mark its fifth wave (wave 5). If the Elliot Wave Principle holds true and if my wave counting is correct then as the theory suggests, the pair should be due for a retracement. Remember that the EWP predicts a correction in the prices after the completion of the fifth wave, starting with wave A and ending with wave C. And given the obvious technical resistances ahead and an overbought condition as indicated in the stochastics, the pair could indeed dip or at least move sideways.

In fact, it had already touched the parity level early today. Still, previous supports around the 1.0000 psychological level have kept the price from falling any further. If if the 1.0000 marker gets breached, the pair could revisit its 1-year low at 0.9916. A break of this low could send it towards the pair’s all time low at 0.9635. But with investors protecting the price at 1.0000 and an oversold condition, the pair could, however, stage a rally.

The Australian dollar has recently marked a new historical high over the US dollar. And from the looks of it, it seems that the AUDUSD pair has still a lot of legs left to move higher. As you can see from its 8-hour chart, the pair has been trading on a well defined uptrend for quite some time now. Earlier this week, the pair opened with a bullish gap though this move was invalidated when it fell below the bottom of the gap. Nonetheless, the tide has even turned for the better now as it formed and then broke out from an ascending triangle formation after moving past its previous all-time high at 0.9849. Gauging from the height of the pattern, the pair could run upwards by at least 150 pips more from 0.9900, bringing the 1.0000 marker in sight.

Contrary to my post last October 5 (kindly see it here), the AUDCAD did not encounter any resistance at its previous high at 0.9200. Instead, it broke right above it to form an ascending triangle pattern. In such pattern, buyers are deemed to be the more aggressive than the sellers. Here, buyers continue to buy the Australian dollar despite the increase in its price while the sellers only sell it at a specific price level. Therefore, a break out to the upside is more likely. If it does, it could spring by another 200 pips or so to even surpass the AUDCAD-parity marker (1.0000). The pair’s present uptrend is also suggesting the probability of a move higher...

epucj	-59914	1293017477	reddit.com	US Dollar Seen to Rally Against the Japanese Yen	So after being routed by Japanese yen for the last three years, it seems like the US dollar‘s recent rally will extend at least in the near term. Earlier today, the Bank of Japan, which is headed by Governor Masaaki Shirakawa, decided to keep its interest rate unchanged for the foreseeable future to encourage spending. Japan’s core consumer price index, which measures the change in the price of goods and services consumed minus the price of fresh food, remains stuck at -0.6%. A decrease in prices suggests that overall consumption in the country is very weak. So to support growth, keeping interest rates at a very low level will jump start lending and spending. The BOJ aims to keep the rates at this level until the CPI reaches 0.1% hopefully by next year. Doing so, of course, would be bearish for the yen since it would make investments in Japan less attractive...

f6ypj	-59914	1295683542	reddit.com	The Rebirth of Phoenix Petroleum (PNX)	Good morning everyone! Phoenix Petroleum or PNX in the Philippine Stock Exchange busted into the scene in yesterday’s trading with a 7.94% gain when it rose from PHP 12.28 to close at PHP 13.32. But what got my attention was the huge volume that accompanied the move. Apparently, there was a big block purchase of 10 million shares at PHP 12.80. In my last post about this issue (kindly check it here), I mentioned the possibility that PNX would follow Petron Corporation’s (PCOR) footsteps (remember when PCOR rose by more than 250% in less than a month). At that time, PNX showed a similar technical set-up, forming a pennant. Unfortunately, the pennant was invalidated when it broke down and the stock skidded to a low of PHP 10.58. It’s a good thing that the red moving average was able to catch it and push it back higher. Coincidentally, the level where it pivoted back was also the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the stocks recent up wave.
f7i66	-59914	1295790050	reddit.com	Philippines Outlook 2011	2010 went particularly well for the Philippine economy as it is expected to have expanded by as much as 7.0% for the whole year. For the first 3 quarters of 2010, the economy already posted a 7.5% expansion which was well above the 5-6% growth target. GDP, as we know, is the total value of final goods and services in the country. At least for 2010, election related spending, soaring remittance and business process outsourcing (BPO) revenue levels, jump in capital investments, and an uptick in exports all helped bring the Philippines into the green zone once again. In May last year, the country held a national election. Several months leading to it, of course, spending took cue as wannabee officials court the masses with projects here and there in hopes of luring them for their votes. Media spending also rose during that period as candidates sell themselves through radio and television commercials, billboards and print ads. The success of the elections, of having a peaceful one, likewise boosted investor confidence. Optimism intensified when Noynoy Aquino, now President of the Philippines, stepped into the country’s driver seat. His administration’s platform of spending rationalization, plugging the leaks in collecting taxes, and its push for more public-private partnerships (PPP) has so far worked and more so attracted additional capital placements.
f8emo	-59914	1295915540	reddit.com	Weakness Seen In The US Dollar	Much attention was given to the stock market for the past couple of weeks. Today, however, I’d like to divert your minds for a while towards the almighty US dollar. The US dollar index (USDX) is an index that measures the value of the USD against a basket of currencies namely the euro (EUR), British pound (GBP), Canadian dollar (CAD), Swedish krona (SEK), Swiss franc (CHF), and Japanese yen (JPY). The value of the index goes up when the greenback appreciates versus the above mentioned currencies (considering their weights) and vice versa.
f9bqy	-59914	1296046668	reddit.com	Technical Update On Silver	Hello commodity peeps! From my last analysis on Silver, I mentioned that there was a head and shoulders pattern forming and the silver price could fall upon the said pattern’s breakdown. A few days later, it broke down and fell. From then on, silver continued to drop from the said pattern and could still do so. However, profit taking actions on short positions at the 26.50 support could occur at the interim. Such then could lead into a temporary rebound in prices. but if it further breaks below that area, its next support could be 25.00. Anyway, the immediate downtrend which I marked in the chart above will nonetheless work as a technical hurdle to prevent any extension in its rallies. Given this breakdown and the apparent swift in trend, I’d say that the bias now is to the downside my folks. It looks like I’ll be shorting this one on strength. But that’s just me.

Now, a lot of you might be asking if there is still some more upside on this issue. remember that back in December 23, 2010, LND was just trading at around PHP 1.03. So given its price action from that time to present, I would say that yes, LND could still move higher. As you can see from its chart above, it just broke out again from a symmetrical triangle. This breakout could be considered valid given the amount of volume the move had. By projecting the height of the symmetrical triangle from the point of breakout, LND could head towards the PHP 2.90 level. It’s uptrend from December is well intact, therefore, any dip in the prices as long as it is above or along the uptrend could be taken as a buying opportunity.
fuama	-59914	1298901292	reddit.com	Shuttle Discovery &amp; Aboitiz Equity Ventures Lifted Off For Space	While Space Shuttle Discovery made its last voyage to to space just a couple of days ago, another launch occurred this morning in the Philippines. This morning’s massive launch, however, came in the form of Aboitiz Equity Ventures or AEV in the Philippine Stock Exchange. AEV’s price canvas above shows you what exactly I’m talking about. Since peaking at PHP 41.50 last December 2010, AEV had been on a steady decline as it had been trading within a descending channel before it made a bullish breakaway gap to finally break above the said channel last February 12. Back then, I mentioned that sch move could be seen as a sign of good things to come. However, AEV just moved in a sideways fashion after gapping up until earlier today when it literally skyrocketed by a monstrous 17.50% to close at PHP 47.00 from an opening of PHP 40.20. Not only that, today’s move was also accompanied by a huge buying that I haven’t seen for quite a long time. Imagine, the total value traded today for AEV reached PHP 3,888,484,220. Moreover, closing at its high and making a bullish morubozu candle formation in the process also suggests that there could still be some upside in this stock.
fzp7u	-59914	1299584548	reddit.com	Ayala Land’s (ALI) Range-Bound Descent	Ayala Land, Inc or ALI in the Philippine Stock Exchange is one of the largest real-estate developers in the country. Its stocks have been rallying the past few days from a low of 14.12 Philippine Peso last Wednesday until today’s high PHP 15.80. However, ALI is on a 5-month downtrend and could further head lower until it reverses its short-term course. If you notice, the stocks have been descending in a range-bound fashion and even respected the resistance during earlier’s trading session. As for the descending channel‘s  bias, the MACD at a negative level and the price below the 100 and 200 moving averages, the stocks could continue to drop and if it does, the immediate support could be PHP 14.12. Then the next support after that is the PHP 13.70 price mark. On the flip-side, a breakout from the descending channel could propel the stocks higher to tap the PHP 15.46 resistance. Once that level gets breached, the next resistance could be PHP 15.90.
g0gin	-59914	1299683265	reddit.com	(ALI) To Get Up From A Punch?	Ayala Land, Inc. (ALI) suddenly showed some signs of life earlier today when it beat the 8 count and closed at PHP 15.28. Not only did it barely ended just outside the resistance of a descending channel, it also attempted to break out from a small inverted head and shoulders pattern. In my colleague’s post about ALI the other day (kindly see it here), things were still somewhat bearish since it was still stuck well within the descending channel. as you can see from the chart above, ALI had been sliding on a downward slope since it peaked at PHP 18.70 back in September last year.
g32di	-59914	1300016131	reddit.com	Nickel Asia Corporation (NIKL) Bound To Drop	Nickel Asia Corporation had its initial public offering (IPO) in the Philippine Stock Exchange last November 22 with “NIKL” as its stock code. The stocks had an IPO value of PHP15.00 then went all the way up to PHP23.00 within 3 months. From there on, it started reversing its course and consolidated to what could be a 2-month head and shoulders pattern. Head and shoulders are often bearish reversal patterns and could be found at the end of an uptrend. If  the NIKL stocks breakdown from the neckline of the head and shoulders, it could drop all the way to my target price of PHP17.70 which I got by adding the size of the head’s base to the possible breakdown point. However, before it reaches that level, it needs to clear out the PHP19.20, PHP18.50 and PHP18.22 levels of support. On the other hand, if it doesn’t breakdown, the stocks could continue to rise and reach its immediate resistance at PHP21.05. Then if that hurdle gets cleared out, the PHP23.00 all-time high could be aimed next.

Fortunately, it could be set another move higher as it appeared to have formed what looks like a symmetrical triangle during the consolidation process. A break above the triangle’s resistance is all we need to confirm the chart pattern. Actually, this could already have broken out today but its 2.4% gain and buying pressure wasn’t strong enough. The stock price opened at PHP5.92, went all the way up to PHP6.15 as it tested the resistance and went down to close at PHP6.08.

The stocks of publicly listed company, Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation or RCB in the Philippine Stock Exchange, went up by 2.9% to PHP28.75 during today’s trading session. This move was backed up with significant amount of volume that makes me consider this a convincing breakout from the 6-month descending channel pattern. If buying pressure follows through, the stocks could reach my conservative target price of PHP31.00 which I got by adding the height of the channel to the breakout point. A few days ago, RCB has also passed above the 100 and 200-day moving averages which tells us the bulls are still around. The MACD has just gone above the positive territory and the RSI is in a stable condition which even strengthens this stock. On the downside, the immediate support could be the 2-month uptrend. If the stocks further drop below that, the next support could be the 2-year uptrend.

My reasons are ethical, health, etc. A friend of mine said he was going to try to go non-meat until January first as part of a bet and for health reasons. He's a very typical hunter/meat-eater/not-taking-good-care-of-himself 30 year old guy who would like to get in better shape etc but doesn't have a lot of will power. I asked how his plan was going and his response was "well I'm not entirely sure about going meatless but I do have a good exercise/diet plan I'm working on" which I think is great for him. He said he wanted to see what Jesus and the bible said about eating meat and let that influence his decision. Not to get on a religious discussion but I don't believe those should factor into a decision like this. I recommended he read "Eating Animals" and even bought another copy to loan him.Have you dealt with someone contemplating vegetarianism from a religious standpoint?

Even the local distributor rep that was at the liquor store at the same time as I was didn't know so I asked them myself via facebook.Me: Are you discontinuing your cask strength?The Macallan:That is correct. Cask Strength is being discontinued due to stock demands from our core ranges.Me: Thank you for your response. I picked up a bottle of the Macallan 12 this weekend and I'm really enjoying it. Will that one be around for a while?The Macallan: Indeed, The Macallan 12 Year Old is part of our core range in the US. Enjoy!So it looks like the cask strength is done and the 12 will be around for a while whether they reformat some others or not.

28922b	-59938	1402888681	Dreams	A dream about a girl	I just woke up from this weird dream I had. So I was on vacation on a southern island (I don't exactly know where, just that it was warm and beautiful) where I was with some friends (I can't remember any of my actual friends there but I know they were friends of mine who were on vacation with me. There was also this group of other people who were either locals or other travellers. We were mostly young people. So we have a good time chilling together and everyone gets along really well. Then things changed. The dream fist felt like real life but now it feels a bit like a video game. I'm still not sure what happened there. So me and two friends leave the camp (we were in a tropical forrest on the countryside a while away from civilization) to get some food or something and suddenly we get attacked by some infected human/zombie thing followed by two more we get armed and I get a gun from a fallen one. An old man from the camp still wants to to go get food from the city. I offer to come with him because I can protect him with my pistol if necessary but he refuses. As we reach the entrance of the camp we hear him screaming and running back to us followed by another thing. We kill it and he lives. Everyone freaks the fuck out as we report what we just witnessed. We think it's the apocalypse or something so we barricade the camp. Next the group of me, my friends and the other group we met traveling head to the city so get supplies. Everything still seems normal there so we do our business and get back. But then chaos breaks out in the city too. We try to find a safe place, a lot of weeiird shit happens and we make it to the subway. As we try to enter the train we realize a group of security guys following us and trying to catch. We think this must be some kind of conspiracy because we did nothing wrong so we flee. The group gets seperated, some find back together and me and some others make it back to the old man's house which is close to our camp. He tells us to hide in his garden because we can't be found there. So this garden looks like some japanese zen garden, the most peaceful and beautiful place you could imagine. Me and this girl from the other group of friends we met find a nice spot and calm down there. This girl. I really liked this girl the whole time. She was cool and nice to me and she was just special. We lay down and try to forget everything for a second. Then the atmosphere becomes so peaceful and relaxed. I'm just happy to be here and now with this girl. Just talking and laying there like nothing happened. I can't really describe the atmosphere but it was really special to me. I ask her if she has a lighter. She hands one to me and I light up. We smoke and talk about everything were trying to process right now. As I want to give her the lighter back she says I can keep it. This is where I realize that we met before and smoked together before because I already have one lighter from her at home. So for some reason this lighter is really special to me. It reminds me of the girl and the special feeling I had when I was alone with her. She gave it to me to remind her because I really like (or love?) her but for some reason we can't be together. This makes us both really sad but the lighter represents the special atmosphere with her. It's hard to describe. Finally we get evacuated from the island and after a sad good bye I'm home to add the lighter to the other one. End of dream.But I have more to add. The moment she told me I can have the lighter and it'll remind me of her I had a deja vú. Like if I already had another dream where the same happened (just without all the apocalypse thing).So the moment I get home I have a false awakening because I can't find the other lighter anymore and the new lighter is gone too. I realize it was a dream and then I really woke up. I woke up crying because my reminder were gone and I realized the girl doesn't exist. Spent a minute crying and trying to process what just happened. What the fuck brain!? First you give me hope for love and then destroy it all...I hope I didn't forget any important details and the dream was actually longer and more happened but this was the most important stuff.  Also sorry for any errors, english isn't my first language.

3a14h9	-59938	1434456997	fo4	My thoughts on Fallout	In the gameplay presentation there were a lot of good changes to see. The game world looks amazingly detailed. VATS is now in slow motion and doesn't stop time. You have tons of opportunities to build and customize your own weapons and even a home. Clothes and armor are now layered. Really the type of things I was hoping to see but didn't dare to expect.There also were some things that irritated me. Todd said player freedom is their #1 goal. This is an rpg after all.  What I didn't expect at all was the change in conversations. I'm not sure how well the new dialogue system and the characters voice are going to work for roleplaying. In the last games you could see the exact words you're going to say and do the voice in your head to fit your character. This worked really well for me. Now we didn't see a lot of dialogue and gameplay in general so I can't really judge the new system but I have some concerns it could take away from the roleplay. Anyways I have faith in Bethesda

I have been meaning to watch the series due to the praise it continually receives from the internet. It has taken me a while to watch the series due to the fact that I prefer interactive media (such as video games) when I want to "kill time".  I also thought the show was potentially "over-hyped", and was pleasantly surprised that it was not.  Maybe it has more to do with the fact that the characters they prtray are similar more than the actual sound of their voice.

I have read several reviews but was coming up with inconsistent/contradictory results so I figured Reddit might have some advice for me.  Thank You

As the title says, I am looking for some newbie info on hardware, software, and anything else you think might be helpful.  I was considering getting GTR Evolution to start, as someone suggested it should go on sale during the steam summer sale.  My biggest question is about the wheel.  I have typically been happy with logitech products, so I was leaning towards the G27.

Do you think this is worth replaying 1 for or are the benefits minor?I know the default on 2 is that Shepard was "evil" which was upsetting, because I played ME1 as a "good" character.

This is quite memorable the captain the unofficial vice captain Orange town 6/10 the great captain buggy always get a laugh from himSyrup village 7/10 introduction to the great usopp and a decent east blue battle with Kuro Baratie 7.5/10 loved when sanji bowed his head upon leaving and don krieg was an alright fight as well. Sanji had a sad backstory as wellArlong park 9/10 really got me into one piece I was hooked after this a lot of memorable scenes loved when luffy brings down arlong park Loguetown 7/10 I love when luffy smiles on the execution platform and smoker compares him to roger. Something that sticks in my mind Warship island 4/10 really nothing great and it's filler Reverse mountain 6.5/10 LABOONNNNN really though I found it hilarious when they out the Jolly Roger on him Whiskey peak 8.5/10 awesome with zoro vs luffy we had set up alabasta which I enjoyed very much loved itCoby and Hellempo side 5/10 it's nothing much really cool side story Little garden 8/10 thought it was very cool and gave usopp a moment where he respects the giants mightily Drum island 9/10 I loved this arc I thought it was the best thing ever one of my favorite scenes when luffy is getting hit but refuses to let choppers idols flag fall truly amazing Alabasta 9.5/10 crocodile vs luffy is so good so good I loved everything about alabasta amazing final fight zoro vs mr 1 and sanji vs Bon clay were awesome as well some say they didn't like it because some times it felt like they just walked through sand but it's one of my favorites Post alabasta 6/10 it's the crews goals but it is filler still worth the watch I think Goat island 4/10 I got a laugh out of it that's it (filler)Rainbow mist 4/10 not really anything good Jaya 9/10 do I know how to throw a punch? Puts hand up floors Bellamy with one shot so badass Skypiea 9/10 some people hated skypiea and others loved it I found it a bit boring in the anime (the 9/10 is for the manga when I went back and read it) I'd say about a 7.5 for the anime but in the manga it's awesome so 9/10 G-8 8.5/10 was hilarious even though it's filler I laughed a lot and honestly enjoyed it it was so funny  Davy back 6/10 everyone despises Davy back but come on it's funny nothing great but it's humorous Oceans dream 4.5/10 meh nothing to put really Foxy returns 6.5/10 again found it funny and leads to when [spoiler](#s aokiji comes)Water 7 9.5/10 amazing at this point for me one piece was at it's best others might disagree but come on water 7 and the following arcs in the saga Enies lobby 10/10 I WANNA LIVEEE TAKE ME WITH YOU!!!! And my favorite scene in the show [spoiler] (#s "cp9 are standing along side spandam and robin and the straw hats chilling below them then sogeking burns down the WG flag") Post enies lobby 9/10 awesome overall and then one if the saddest scenes in op  but yeah really goodLovely land 4/10 filler Thriller bark 7/10 honestly not the best but had some legendary and I mean legendary moments I don't know if you guys would say it like that but pure awesome when [spoiler] (#s "zoro takes kumas attack full on for his captain") Sabaody archipelago 9/10  sad sad arc but it's great Boss luffy 4.5/10 Amazon lily 8/10 I liked it and found it quite funny Impel down 9.5/10 rivals with water seven and Enies lobby awesome awesome arc I won't say anything more I'm case I didn't use the spoiler properly Straw hats separation special 8/10 hahahaha poor sanji Marineford 10/10 it was amazing except for you know when happens oh my Post war 9/10 when they flashback to [spoiler] (#s luffy and aces childhood it's so cool)Return to sabaody 9/10 might of overrated this one but come on "too slow" Fishman island 7.5/10 honestly the crew is just so much stronger here than there opponents  however the scene where [spoiler] (#s luffy uses red hawk on hody and they see a picture of luffy then ace then luffy then ace then luffy) amazing Punk hazard 6.5/10 it sets up dress rosa but nothing spectacular get a kick out of caeser though Dress rosa as of right now it's getting pretty crazy in the manga but I'm not sure what to rate it as it's not done about 8.5/10 cpuld get as far as 10/10 depending on what's next Spa island 5/10 filler

37t15j	-59980	1432957979	OnePiece	Akainu and marine ford, (marine ford spoilers)	I had read something saying that originally admiral akainu was supposed to die In the war of the best. I honestly think this would've been so much better. The marines won the battle of the best and took out ace and wb as a bonus (although he wanted to die there) I think that if akainu died in a battle from garp it would have made the marines at least lose a big player. I have never wanted anything more to happen In a series than garp vs akainu

38134j	-59980	1433124214	OnePiece	Death in one piece	So I'm the story so far the only two official deaths (not including flashbacks) but by the time we hit the final arc I can't think of another way of the plot ending without a fair amount of people dying. First off I think it's possible for one of the crew members to die, my bet would be ussop completing his dream of becoming a brave warrior of the sea. Although it's very much I'm the air I don't think he will die but it's possible. My next death I think is certain is the death of black beard. In the presumed final showdown between the luffy and bb I don't think it's satisfying enough for him to just be sent off to impel down. Next death I think is extremely probable is akainu, the fleet admiral is ruthless and will not stop at anything, he also has taken the life of ace and I could see either luffy sabo or even garp killing him. There are other theories such as bb killing shanks, which I think would happen to recreate that hatred between teach and luffy however I think it could work just as well with shanks being alive

3b9ek3	-59980	1435368753	OnePiece	The navy admirals	My problem is that people seem to be doubting the three marine admirals powers suggesting that quite a few characters are "admiral level" even though these are some of the most powerful characters in the series. First off as of right now current manga luffy there ismt a chance in hell he'd beat kizaru fujitora akainu former admiral Aokiji and would probably lose to un revealed admiral ryokugyuThe only people I think who are above the power of any of these admirals or former admiral akainu areShanks WhitebeardBlackbeard MAYBE big mam/Kaido Rayleigh in his current age could probably put up a good fight Marco is probably a little bit below these fellas but would get his share of hits in
3dalqa	-59980	1436904300	OnePiece	Chapter 794 predictions (spoilers obviously)	I think that fujitora will end up attacking law and luffy because we already have a admiral who left the marines because of a dispute so i just dont see fujitora leaving as well.

(Greed Island heavens arena chimera ant) i was hoping that they would stay together as a group and take on challenges together but they really did split up. I'm hoping if the manga continues we will see more of the entire group together taking on enemies together.

3f12xe	-59980	1438178813	OnePiece	Am I the only one who wants the new admiral to be like akainu	I am hoping that ryokugyu ends up being like akainu in terms of justice and morales because as of right now. Kizaru doesn't give a shit really, fujitora has a good sense of justice so I hope ryokugyu is really tough and has a fuck pirates mentality like akainu
3f8g1q	-59980	1438305474	OnePiece	I don't think the one piece and the ancient weapons are related at all	Now I've seen quite a few theories about what one piece is and a lot think its related to the void century and the ancient weapons, i don't think so, i think people are forgetting we've already seen an ancient weapon (poseidon) and nothing has come of it YET. but my most important point is that it would tie in luffy and robins dreams together.

3ian4p	-59980	1440477793	OnePiece	Scenario i have had for a very long time about garp and akainu. (Long but i put lots of effort into it)	During the war of marineford after the death of ace garp walks towards akainu with bloodlust in his eyes, only to be stopped by sengoku. During this time garp says "you better hold me down sengoku, before i kill that damn sakazuki!" When i see that garp was put down so easily you know he wasn't resisting what so ever i thought what would happen if garp went out on akainu? I wrote this long thing regarding what i think the final war would look like if garp attacks akainu. flash forward towards the end of the series with a war even bigger than marineford, luffy is fighting blackbeard and has been injured, (as you may expect when fighting an emperor ) akainu takes note of this and looks to kill luffy while he fights blackbeard, as sabo comes in an attempt to save luffy he has a short bout with akainu where he is defeated. as akainu rushes over to luffy we see sabo jump in front of luffy ready to take to blow for him as ace did, we see sabo talk about how luffy must become pirate king and as an older brother he will not allow luffy to die, something along those lines. Akainu will then mock sabo about ace and say something along the lines of saying ace was worthless and such. During this time we see garp walk towards them and he goes through an emotional memories of him and ace, right up until his death. During the flashback we see garp talking to ace before he sets sail and talks about what a man roger was and despite being a rival, he was a friend. Ace breaks down in tears and asks garp "old man, was it good that i was born, does my life have any meaning?" Garp replies with "if you dont think you have any purpose ace, remember luffy, sabo and how you must keep living for them, i've been around these seas plenty do not consider yourself a burden when your loved ones need you. Ace......stay alive for, luffy, sabo...........and for me" while garp walks towards akainu, sengoku spots him and rushes over. Garp rushes over and punches akainu right in the gut saying "get........the fuck away from my grandsons" after akainu spits out blood and is sent a good distance away he comes back towards them saying "vice admiral garp, i will deal with this infraction later, given your status in the marines if you turn around right now i shall over look this blunder, any further action will require you to resign from the marines" garp takes his marine jacket and throws it to the floor and says "that was the last time.......i put work over family, say your prayers sakazuki, i let you kill my grandson once........ I refuse to let you so hurt another!" Akainu makes a joke about garp's age such as "perhaps if this was 20 years ago you would have a chance but now your just a old man waiting on deaths door, i dont have the time for you" as he goes around garp in a second effort at luffy. garp reappears in front of him saying "sakazuki you better not take me lightly, i will show no mercy on those who hurt family!" During this time sengoku rushes over towards garp and akainu ready to stop garp from any further damage, he screams "Garp! What the hell are you doing? Are you really gonna let your emotions take over and ruin everything you've accomplished!" Garp replies "sengoku im not in the mood for games, if you try and stop me i wont hold  back, i i refuse to let my family die again, in the name of the late portgas D ace i will protect them at all cost! Think very carefully about what you do next sengoku im prepared to lay everything down for the ones i love" sengoku hesitantly charges garp to only be stopped by rayleigh, rayleigh then says "when a man is ready to lose everything in the name of family and you attack blindly, it will be you who loses it all" we then see a flash back to before the war with garp and rayleigh saying if something were to happen with luffy and akainu he will attempt to kill akainu, garp then asks rayleigh to hold off any one who attempts to get in the way. Setting up the ultimate fights, garp vs akainu, rayleigh vs sengoku and luffy vs blackbeardI think this is something that could possibly happen and have envisioned it since marineford i even think the name of the chapter would sound perfect "Marine no more! Garp the hero's furious attack" please tell me what you think of this :)
3iinau	-59980	1440624607	OnePiece	Could the mods start doing weekly character discussions?	I think this would be a good way to add more meaningful conversation to this sub along with pointing out roles in the story from characters. One piece certainly has enough supporting characters with enough depth to base the discussion off of.  
3ir0xn	-59980	1440783198	OnePiece	Weekly character discussion: Sir crocodile	I made a post a day or two ago asking the mods to do weekly character discussions and it was asked why don't i do it so here i am. Every friday i will be posting discussions on characters we have encountered in the one piece universe.**When crocodile first made his appearance what did you think of him at first? Did you think you would like him as the story progressed.****What did you think of his system of baroque works, did you like how it was different from a standard pirate group?****Do you think we have seen crocodiles power to his full extent?  What ways could crocodile enhance his abilities such as he did fighting in a desert****Do you like the path Oda took with crocodile?****Who would you like to see crocodile fight?****What is your favorite moment with crocodile?****Would you have liked to see more or less of crocodile?****Did you like how crocodile was brought back during the war and helped luffy?****Do you have any theories about crocodile? No crocomom, please**Please Spoiler tag anything that has yet to happen in the anime. Please add only meaningful comments that are meant for discussion.
3j3z60	-59980	1441042911	OnePiece	A thought about kinemons fruit (fairy tail spoilers)	A lot of people say that kinemon has one of if not the weakest devil fruit in the series, however while i was watching fairy tail a thought came into my mind, could kinemon make armor appear onto himself or other since it is technically clothing? This might have some battle effectiveness and maybe if he found a way to do it he could make his power along the line of erza's magic from fairy tail. Ive been thinking of ways to make his fruit strong and this was the best i could think of

2emikr	-59981	1409060100	AskReddit	[Serious] Are internet speeds and providers in the US really &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; bad compared the Europe?	Coming form one of the most densely internet connected countries in the world (the Netherlands) I'm often surprised and baffled by the sheer amount of complaints about internet providers in the US, like Comcast, their service, connection speeds etc. A technologically advanced country that basically invented the internet, should be far ahead on this matter I imagine. Also, customer satisfaction is also something that usually is a bigger "thing" in the US then in Europe. So, what is the reason for all this?I'm really interested in your stories!
