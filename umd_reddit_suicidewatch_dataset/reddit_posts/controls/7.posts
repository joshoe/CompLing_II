2hiu4n	-12004	1411735463	books	High School English	I loved reading but when being forced to read something it was awful.  My senior year we got a new English teacher right out of college and she was awesome...we had Friday Readday. We would sit anywhere in the classroom and read whatever we wanted, seriously whatever we wanted, and we have to find quotes we liked and share them on the board once a week during "readday." You had to turn in a sheet letting her know what you were reading and what page you were on weekly so she knew you were actually reading and when you finished give an impromptu review in front of the class...nothing fancy just would you recommend it and what was it really about.  It was awesome I read some of my favorite and some of my least favorite books at this time and it was awesome seeing people that I knew to hate reading really enjoying that free time/reading atmospherewas there a special teacher in your life or someone who really made reading fun for you?

2g4fsv	-12012	1410458086	DnD	Game of Thrones on 5E Mechanics?	Being that 5E is roleplay heavy, maybe 5E is better suited than 4e and 3.5 to take on ASOIAF? I know a GOT d20 based rpg exists, but I feel that DnD is a bit more extensive and expanded. It'd literally just take a collaborative effort from anyone interested enough in playing to re-write some stuff, rules, maps, and pretty much make our "own" DnD/GoT cross over.Humans can have many sub-races, such as Doth'Raki, Dornish, Imps, Targareyan, and anything else I can't think of right now. The Doth'Raki can be proficient in horse riding, scimitars(arakhs), whips, and speak Doth'Raki(d'uh). Dornish can be experts of poison, daggers, spears, acrobatics..You get the idea. If there is enough interest, I figure enough of us can sit down and collaborate on making this work.Classes can be simply renamed. Fighter can stick, Warlocks exist in ASOIAF, Clerics can be renamed Maesters, Mages can be Blood mages(Mirri Maz Duur), Rogues can still be rogues..Druids can be modified to Worgs. The list can be endless here. Affiliations/factions: Nights Watch, Brothers Without Banners, Second Sons, The Faceless Men, Winterfell, Starks, Tullys, LannisterThe hook/campaign and what can be political. The deeper we go in the story, the more plot twists and reveals can happen(or have multiple different twists that the DM can control via d6 or so, to even keep the story fresh for the DM.) Enemies can include White Walkers/Others(take extra damage by fire), Humans, Giants, Wildlings, Deserters of the Nights Watch, corrupt gold cloaks and city watch, Dragons?, wights..All in all, these are just sloppy ideas off the top of my head to see if anyone would seriously consider sitting down and re-working DnD with me to fit ASOIAF. We could continue on by tackling everything one by one, such as races, classes, maps, weapons, armor, and then some. I mean, come on? Who doesn't picture being the King of the North??
2g5kct	-12012	1410480346	characterdrawing	(LFA) Lord Belmore Carter, The Noble Barkeep Rogue	Lord Belmore Carter is a lordship who runs a cities local barkeep brothel. He is the son of Baemor Carter, a noble knight who serves in their current kings army. Belmore is 5'11, a fit slim build, human, well kept hair style cut neatly and a thin twirl to his mustache. Dressed in noble clothes and a sly grin, Belmor hides the fact that he is a deadly rogue who wields a cleverly sheath dagger. The noble clothes are like a dirt brown and forest green tailored color. He has soft blue eyes. Belmore acts as a council member to town gatherings. If anyone happens to be bored enough or interested, thanks a lot. I'd love to see what everyone could come up with. I'd base him as a younger Petyr Baelish from Game of Thrones. But don't let that rule over the creative flow. I'd like to see artists encouraged to add their own personality to it. Thanks again.
2gew2f	-12012	1410739975	DnD	New DM To 5e LMoP, Need story help.	So, I decided to be a little creative with the storyline. I "borrowed" an idea from someone else's post and added my own flare to it. Let me know if anything else would work better in place of this. Or if something here can be developed a little more.In the beginning, pre-ambush, I will add the sense of doppelgängers in the area. They will not be presented right away, but more as a "glimpse of a shadow in the forest, but it scurries away too quickly to be recognized as anything" to give the PCs a sense of them being watched and or followed.Driving the wagon will be a commoner NPC, hired solely to drive the wagon. As the goblins attack, it will be grappled and held for cover by one of the goblins. Giving the PCs an urgency to protect something. Should they fail, no biggie. He was a casualty of the battle.Then I will introduce a rogue/noble politician NPC in Phandalin, a man who seeks the gain political control of Phandalin and raise it to the glory it held long ago. He wishes to cast out the bullying thugs and take control, making a government for the people. Later on, I want to introduce the Green Dragon in some fashion by having him play a dragon riddles game with the PCs. We all know how fond dragons are for riddles.Then later, I want to incorporate Iarno as one of the main baddies instead of a good guy. Kind of playing a double agent role. Basically tricking Sildar into protecting and funding the operation until all goes according to plan. While tricking Gundren to lead him to the cave, mining it, and then getting rid of him when he is no longer useful. The rogue, as mentioned earlier, turns out to be a head leader of the Redbrands. Revealing his plot that it is easier to trick the public in to giving him what he wants, rather than stealing it from them. Using political force, lies and manipulation. Any ideas?

We play in Brooklyn, NY. Seeking an experienced DM for some 5E homebrew, or possible one shot, just to see if meetings can happen consistently.
2ujviv	-12012	1422907412	dndnext	Kind of forced in to the DM role, group decided on a homebrew..I'm kind of stuck, please help? (5E)	So, long story short..I had assembled a group from r/lfg for an offline meet up to do D&amp;D 5E. Fast forward a few months, of the five players assembled (two being myself and my girlfriend), only one other stuck and he's new(to 5E, came over from Pathfinder) so he stands as the most experienced in tabletop RPGs. I have just been getting in to D&amp;D. One of the players who left was going to DM. Now, we assembled a new group, now most of them being my friends and one other being a friend of my girlfriends.. EVERYONE is new besides Pathfinder guy.I gave them 5 different scenarios for a homebrew as we deciced we did not want to do HOTDQ..They chose a necromancer looking to take over the world scenario who has an obsession with riddles. The plot also has the necromancer all ready on a war path, taking over one major city in the mountains and claiming it as his own.Donjon has been great for me by helping generate an atlas map, random inns, and NPCs..I have lore, an atlas map, NPCs, tavern games, and all that. Basically, everything is done..but I have no idea how to create a powerful necromancer with a fearful stat block..nor have I really made a good motivation for him to take over the world. This homebrew is technically everything custom made, just running off the 5E engine. I want this particular campaign to run until level 10. The main town they will start in is near by, but not exactly close to the main villains lair. The starting town is a big city and almost Utopian..Basically, I'm looking for custom made stat blocks for:Necromancer (Main villain for level 10 adventure, 5 PC's)General of the necromancers army (Sub boss? Maybe level 7-9)?And maybe a low level boss? The more the better...Thank you for any and all of your help.

I was never served and never knew about this case until I recently was playing around with the eTrack system and found the case against me. I do not live in NYC at this point and am not sure how to best proceed about vacating the default. I spoke with the Civil Clerk's office and was told that while the judge granted the default, the plaintiff never entered it. I understand that CPLR 3215(c) is applicable in this case for failure to enter the default within one year. I am not sure why the court, sua sponte, does not dismiss the case for plaintiff's failure to enter the DJ against. Please advise on how to best proceed to dismissing this action. Do I file a Order to Show cause or some other motion? Is the dismissal with prejudice?Should I wait out a little longer before dismissing it and thereby barring the plaintiff from refiling the case because the SOL will lapse?

l8kh0	-12017	1318358271	scifi	Another "help me find this book" post	I read this in probably the 1985-1990 timeframe, and have never been able to find it again.The protagonist is a mercenary/hitman/soldier whose past is somewhat foggy (may actually be amnesia, due to some trauma, I don't really remember). He has cybernetic implants which he activates by clenching his teeth.  He owns a weapon that is specifically mated to him though some kind of interface between an implant in his palm and the handgrip of the weapon. When he clenches his teeth, a web-like target reticule appears in his vision indicating where the weapon is aiming. Eventually, I think he finds another mercenary with a similar modification, like a long-lost brother or fellow soldier, who I *think* he hunts down.I know it's kind of vague, but I appreciate any help.

I won't be driving (on my Ls).Either she might be a bit arrogant about her driving ability or I'm being paranoid, but we want to get there within a day and I think it might be unfair on her, but she thinks she can handle it.Is the distance difficult/dangerous for inexperiencedish drivers?Anyone with some road trip tales to tell?Or anyone with experience driving from Syd to Melb, please share.Otherwise, we can just buy some plane tickets and public transport it.ThankzzzzEdit: Thanks for the replies everyone. Wanted to hear some specific advice for our situation, just reaffirming some of my existing concerns.

I barely spoke to her and she was in and out of store within 3 minutes... but she does have my business card on which I shakily wrote the address of another one of our other stores. She is so frickity frackin beautiful in real lifeI have such a hideous crush on her HAHAHA and this never fucking happens in Australia. I feel like I need to commemorate this occasion somewhere.

2vm3vt	-12057	1423711595	smashbros	strategy for doubles	My school just held a 1v1 in smash 4 and they are talking about holding a 2v2. I am a jigglypuff main and my partner is going to be a fox/pikachu. So of course I can't just do my 1v1 strat so my question is what do we want to do focus on the person with the most stock, the least or somewhere in the middle?

I've seen Andrew McMahon twice so far at the house of blues in Boston and Webster Theater in Hartford, both shows were phenomenal. But last night... During Synesthesia he pulled out one of those parachute things for gym class in elementary school and everyone was underneath it dancing and singing. Then all of a sudden I turn around and there he was! Andrew McMahon was right behind me still singing and then he stopped and sung there for a bit. It was so awesome he was two feet away from me singing and looking at me. Definitely the best concert ever!

For me it started a little over 6 years ago when my dad set up a class at a local judo club on the weekend for him and some of the guys he works with. They're cops so it was more of a no gi judo/jj for self defense kind of thing. Then he took me to the local tournament the club used to hold, and when I said hey this is awesome I want to try, he brought me to the regular class during the week. When the then head coach set my legs up for a triangle choke and taught me drop seoi, I was hooked for life! 6 years later I am an assistant coach and my favorite throw is still drop seoi. :)

The lady asked my mom to join her for lunch since she was there alone, too. She accepted.   They talked about the lady's daughter and how much she missed her.   The waitress came over and asked "What can i get you to drink?" My mom answered.   Then the waitress said "And for your mother?".  Before my mom could answer, the old lady said she would like a coffee.   When the waitress left, my mom asked the old lady why she didn't correct the waitress. The old lady said she was having such a great time with my mom and she was so like her daughter, could they just pretend she was her daughter. My mom found it weird, but agreed on that.   After they ate, the old lady said her good byes and excused herself from the table. The waitress came over with the bill and my mom asked if the lady had paid her share. The waitress said, "No. On her way out, she said her daughter would take care of it". My mom said, "I'm not her daughter". The waitress said "Well i heard you two talking and you called her mom". So my mom paid the bill, seeing as it was useless to try to explain and left.   When she got outside, she saw the old lady getting on a bus.She ran quickly and calling her angrily but the old lady ignored her. As she was getting on the bus, my mom grabbed her bag while the doors shut on the bus and my mom was left standing with the bag.  You know what was in the bag?  A load of shit.

Else the weight of Vilemaw would crush it's Exoskeleton, which normal spiders have. Tank you for that RaleonNightShado.EDIT 2: Yaaaaay, my firstpost is on the frontpage :'D tank you all
1ax7sq	-12108	1364147262	leagueoflegends	Riot, could you change the icon for Tenacity or for (Cho'Gaths) Vorpalspikes?	Just a simple 'Riot plz'Whenever I play **Cho'Gath** I always get confused wether or not my *VorpalSpikes* are active. The icons for tenacity and *VorpalSpikes* are the same and for some reason when I have *Mercs* or *Spirit of the AcientGolem* I get confused. Simply forgetting I have tenacity and leaving the *VorpalSpikes* off untill I notice by the lack of animation. This can often take awhile when there are alot of big effects during teamfights and such.For what I know about coding (wich is very little) I'd think that changing a little icon to something else wouldn't take too long and would make life in the league a little easier for some of us :3Thanks!

1cldwq	-12108	1366269814	leagueoflegends	Minion Swarm Gametype	Me and my friends have been doing this special gametype for fun. We let someone push down all the inhibs of a 5-man team wich grinded to level 6 each. When the inhibs go down... the game begins. You have to defend with your buds to save the nexus. The enemy will not join the fight. Its just you+friends vs the minions. You can't leave the base.It's such a thrill to defend 3 waves of double superminions and keeping your towers up as long as posible. When the inhibibor respawns the Singed (*we use singed every time for his superior pushing power to get to the inhibs asap to set up the game*) distroys it instantly and that is all he does all game. Buying the correct items as Ravenous Hydra, Spiritstone upgrade items in combination with wriggle, homeguard and banner of command. The item combinations are so different fro the normal meta, just becouse you're not fighting champions. Taking 5 smites suddenly is the way to go.We have only once gotten to the point where we stabilized the base. The minions couldn't kill the nexus since we cleared it too fast. This was with a Malzahar. The E-chain he got on was rediculous. At one point we all got an E to keep chaining and so effectively keeping the wave off our nexus.This gametype brings us such a thrill that I feel I should share it with the community. The downside to it is that it takes a long time to set up and 1 player (the Singed) just sits back and can't do anything. That's why I hope Riot can put in some kind of sandbox mode or maybe just a way of implementing this into custom games. Like, they could add the **Hunt the Teemo** gametype and **Minion Swarm** into custom game options or something.Just an idea, let me know what you think :D&lt;3EDIT: Not native English speaker, feel free to correct me

What is known is that Nunu fled from the Frostguard together with Willump. Udyr was attacked by Lissandra and she killed his mentor so I'm guessing he is at least against the Frostguard. But he has no alliance. Just like Nunu and Willump.**Brand** is speculated to be the opposite of Lissandra. They are elemental opposites and Brand was found in a prison of True Ice. Possibly Brand was inprisoned by Lissandra and so from acient times the Nemesis of Lissandra.I might have missed something along the lines so feel free to correct/add aditional stuff.

1sdsxl	-12108	1386507249	leagueoflegends	My insight on Evelynn-Jungle.	Hey there Reddit, do you remember that a couple of patches ago stealth was being nerfed? Twitch and Evelynn got changed to relieve some of the global pressure their *stealth* gave. If I remeber correctly the Patch-Preview said that the stealth at the time was **forcing** people to play more passively in fear of a stealthed champion closing in on them, leading to a **stale playstyle** that Riot wanted to get rid of.Now seeing as Pinkwards are changed and Evelynn's stealth far superior due to this change to the Vision wards, is it maybe time to look back at what they said? We are now forced to either **play passively** near the save-heaven our Towers supply or buy a Vision ward, effective of countering **1 gank attempt** since it will be cleared after being spotted.I think Eve should be adjusted since Riot said they inteded to fix the stale gameplay and unfortunatly, it's back.Just my two cents.

23rueb	-12108	1398266451	leagueoflegends	State of Rengar	**TL;DR: Rengar's base abilies are too weak due to nerfs intended to shut down the base ability in combination with it's Empowered version - which are no longer needed due to the per level scaling of Empowered Abilities. And the Stealth indicator is poop.**Ever since his release Rengar has seen some serious nerfs, buffs and balance changes to make him work. I most certainly understand that Rengar has a fine line between being OP and being useless but I feel like they butchered him to the point of not being able to play him at all. * Q - It gives you a little bonus damage on your next auto-attack but is barely noticable for being such an important part of his kit. Since Ferocity abilities now scale on levels there is no reason to max this skill since it's nothing but an auto-attack reset. * W - This would be the skill that I level since it's the only one that's reliable. Gives you a set amount of Armour and MR + a bonus for Enemy champions or big monsters hit. Sadly it barely does any damage in lane and the cooldown is too long for it to be effective harass/waveclear.* E - Bola clearly has the most base damage and would be the most effective lane harass if it wasn't so hard to hit. Now I know that hitting skillshots is a practice but if you max the skill it's going to be your main damage output, miss it and the trade is off and you're fucked. It has some nice range and damage if you level it but does * R - Stealth is only as good as the amount of ground you can cover with it. You have a base of 345 MMS + 25% bonus and you have 5 seconds of stealth you can cover 2156 range with that ult. Not bad right? This means you can get from Top Tri-Brush to lane unnoticed and walk up behind your enemy for the kill. But this is not the case. Since enemies will get an alert when you are within 1000 range. This will make them walk back since you are coming in for the kill, making the stealth less effective. Basicly, you can cover the ground in stealth untill you are within 1000 range of your target, after that you need to lock the target down since else he will run away. Chasing people down with this ability has also been made harder by the indicator since they will run away as soon as they get alerted. All of this wouldn't be too bad if you could still generate Ferocity in your ult. You could jump onto a minion and try to land a Bola - Lee Sin style (using W to close distance to a minion and then using Q to hit the target)-  and the target could be snared (if you hit) for a follow up. But you only get ferocity after your ult, and since you arn't maxing Bola in the Jungle due to it having a set 10 second CD the 60% slow from a level 1 Bola is not rewarding for such a mechanical play.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who remembers [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpRXiyIvvX4#t=300) trailer. It showed the warchief betrayal missions as much more in depth than what we can do. This trailer shows you branding a bodyguard then being able to wait until when you want to make him attack, and it does the little cutscene with the backstab. You even can see all the followers in the crowd with the hands over them.But whenever you make a bodyguard betray his master, it just gives you the mission, does the same "knock him off the stage" animation everytime, and then you have to jump into the brawl. The trailer also mentions being able to trigger branded Uruks individually rather than all at once. Can you do this in the release version?Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy this game, just WTF is up with some of this stuff not being anywhere near as in depth as what they advertised?

2l3adz	-12116	1414959061	ShouldIbuythisgame	[SIB] Call of Duty Advanced Warfare?	I'm hoping some of you prepurchased it and got to play it today, is it fun? It looks like a solid concept and the fact that they got Kevin Spacey on board must mean the story is at least halfway decent. But I'm mainly looking to get it for the multiplayer. I've had BF4 since launch (beta actually) and have yet to finish more than the 1st mission in the campaign. If the campaign is cool I probably will play it, just not nearly as much as the MP.SIB CoD: AW or wait for it to go on sale? (I'm on PC, so come December I can probably get it for less than $25 once the winter sale starts)EDIT: I got it, bigger paycheck than expected. I am enjoying it a lot. The multiplayer is really fun (single player seems cool to except the FoV is locked at 65, can't go longer than 10 min without a headache). I haven't owned/played a CoD since Modern Warfare 1 came out, so that might be a contributing factor. I really like the movement. Having a double jump with a dash (from a high enough jump you can do two dashes before you hit the ground) makes for crazy agility, my only real complaint is that mobility combined with how little health you have in CoD can make for some frustration. Once you get the hang of it, it is very fun though. I like the rock-paper-scissors with abilities and perks.Like, one of the sights you can unlock makes any enemies in it glow bright red for easier tracking, so there's one perk that negates that, etc. I like how you can use "wildcards" to double up on things at the expense of an extra inventory slot. IDK if this is similar to the loadouts in other recent CoDs (Havent played them) but I like it. One thing, PC users, in the graphics settings, turn both shadow cache options off. IDK what they fuck they do, but they somehow result in *worse* texture resolution while *lowering* your FPS. I was so frustrated for a while with "maxed" graphics but still having textures worse than an xbox 360. But the game does run well on less powerfull systems. GTX 760 and i5 4440 w/ 8GB RAM and I get consistent 45+ fps at maxed (minus those two options) settings/1080p.

That Karma train has long since past, stop trying to hop on that bandwagon. The logic also makes no sense, if you really enjoy Titanfall so much, then play Titanfall. You should be able to enjoy TF for the things it does well, not use it as a reason to hate on another game. Not to mention the fact that they are only similar in that they're both 1st person shooters. Made by different developers and aren't even really aimed at the same target audience. Also funny how these posts seem to always start with "I haven't played Titanfall in ages, but after AW I'm back into it". Well, you must have no been *that* big of a TF fan if you haven't played it in a long time, and didn't even remember it except from not liking another game. Siderant as long as were on lack of logic, it really bothers/annoys me when people claim "The exo abilities in AW are useless". Really? That's funny, since some of them are literally identical to abilities in TF, there's the temporary speed boost, the cloak and the "see enemies through walls". If those abilities are "useless" in CoD, they're useless in TF as well. I'm not saying you *have* to enjoy AW, but why are so many of you posting about AW in a *Titanfall* sub? Go complain about what you don't like in a AW sub. /endrant, apologies for the lengthEDIT: It seems some of you don't understand that I'm not a CoD fanboy. AW is actually the first CoD I've owned/played since MW1 came out (probably why I'm enjoying it more than people who've kept up with the series, it feels more "new" to me). You are free to criticize CoDAW all you want, my only two irks are: A) Make them *valid* criticisms: If you complain that a speed boost, cloak and seeing enemies through walls are "useless" abilities to have...well...those exact abilities are in Titanfall as well...and B) You shouldn't be complaining about AW in a *Titanfall* subreddit. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/CodAW/) is the Advanced Warfare subreddit, if you want to discuss AW and what it does well/wrong, go there. My main concern is not, as some of you seem to believe, being annoyed at seeing a game I like criticized. I'm annoyed that the subreddit for a game I very much enjoy is having posts complaining about a different game. And frankly, like I said before, if you truly enjoy Titanfall, there isn't any need to bring another game into it. Just like Titanfall without having to put down another game to make your point. 
2lvort	-12116	1415643267	CodAW	What's up with the playerbase in this?	So this is the first CoD I've purchased since MW1 came out. I enjoy the gameplay a lot, the MP is awesome (SP looks sick but that locked FoV @ 65 gives me headaches).What I'm about to say might piss some of you off, but I'm being honest...here goes. One of the things I've always enjoyed about PC compared to console is that 9 times out of 10 you will have a more mature playerbase. On PC, for me at least, I almost never head rude/obscene shittalking, when I go over to my buddies place and watch him play MW3 on 360, it seems like every other lobby has someone screaming about how much of a faggot everyone else is or how they fucked everyones mother. Anyway, like I said, most PC games I almost never see this, but...in AW, it's nearly as bad as 360. I'm actually appalled at how often I'm hearing people say "You're garbage man, sell your computer and kill yourself" or something similar. And I don't even play ranked!Any other PC users noticing this? Console as well, is there more unwarranted shit talking in AW compared to other CoDs? Maybe Call of Duty just attracts more of that type of gamer than other shooters do.

It's extremely simple and works better than air freshener. Once you finish your smelly business, just light a match. Let it burn for a few seconds, then blow it out/throw it away (I usually just flush it but to each their own). Something with the phosphorous in the head burning, I don't know the exact science behind it, it just cancels out/overrides other smells almost immediately. Open a window for some airflow, and you're good.  Even if you don't smoke, keeping a box of matches on your can prove useful. We've all had nature call when we were at a lady's place and worried about making her bathroom smell like the swampthing overate at chipotle.

I've just reinstalled it since I heard there was that big v0.50 update. Tried one life, was able to find a stun baton (which was surprisingly useless against zombies) and died. Are there any good guides that explain what you should do when you first spawn (I'm talking "Explain like I'm 5" levels of simple)? Or any other new players looking to group up or whatever you do?
2mkzej	-12116	1416249525	ShouldIbuythisgame	[WSIB] Rust or The Forest?	They both seem to be similar, open world, crafting games. From the trailers, the main difference seems to be single player vs multiplayer. I've seen some videos of more "late game" rust with gun fights, and while that looks fun, I've also heard that new players more often than not get ambushed/killed by players who already have guns, and almost always seem to be entirely naked. While I know the inclusion of multiplayer could *potentially* make rust more fun, it can also make it 100x more frustrating if the player base sucks. Anyone who's played The Forest, how in depth is it? The traps/forts you can build look cool but they seem very underpowered compared to some of the mutant things you have to fight, but maybe that's from more late game. Do you ever get guns or is it more blunt/sharp weapons?I don't suppose anyone has played/owns both?

I'll be very careful to not hit *them* with anything, just the wanted mark. Once the wanted guy is dead, the security services will start to send the "lining up attack run" messages and attack me, but there wont be any "wanted" indicator in the lower right. Am I missing something or is this a bug? If I hop into supercruise and just do a quick U-turn right back to the Nav Beacon they stop attacking me. Still frustrating you're trying to save up for an Anaconda and you have to waste fuel/time on this.

From what I've heard, the gtx 970 is still a phenomenal card as long as you aren't using more than one monitor or anything above 1080p.Is this the case? The entire reason I want to upgrade my GPU is so I can get a 1440p monitor (I doubt my 760 would handle it very well). I've thought about a 960 but unless they come out with some 4GB versions I'm hesitant. EDIT: Apparently there will be 4GB GTX 960s come march. I think I shall hold out for one of those if they look good. Thanks for the replies and advice!http://techreport.com/news/27726/report-4gb-of-ram-coming-to-gtx-960-in-march

The devs even admit she's too powerfull right now, do you just not have enough skill to win with a balanced monster?"Well, now that is more or less the same situation with sunny. The dev's have admitted that she is way more powerful than intended. She's not only powerful, she's versatile. Her win % is way to high regardless of who she is on a team with. For a support class, whose entire role is to buff the team, that's ridiculous.But when a monster player complains that a hunter chose to play sunny, oh my god the hunters get so defensive."Don't be so salty man, you're acting like a child. It's part of the game if you don't like it play a different game"Am I the only one who notices this? What happened to wanting to win with skill rather than exploits. I don't understand how using an OP monster makes you the bane of existence in some people's eyes, but when you use an OP hunter it's just "part of the game" and anyone who complains is just being salty Don't even get me started on people who exploit the shield drone bug /endrant E: Some of you don't seem to get the point I'm making, I'm not saying sunny is an insta win where it doesn't matter how stupid your team mates are. A bad team is a bad team. I'm saying sunny can turn a *mediocre* team into a *great* team. *e.g.* A good trapper with Sunny on their team becomes an *unavoidable* trapper that you cannot escape from.

I've been making all my money by collecting bounties, and while it can sometimes go wonderfully with every ship giving 30k+, sometimes you just can't find any bounties and when you do they're only 1k-3k. I've heard mining can be a good way to earn credits relatively quickly, it seems like if you could find a good system for it, it would be a pretty consistent flow of credits. I'm saving up for a python and have only just broken 1 million credits, so to put it mildly I still have quite a ways to go, should I just keep going for bounties?

Get the community more active in the game with goals to reach. It's a great way to counter some of the bad press they got at release and with the new characters being released less than perfect. I just think that no matter how poorly the community does in the challenges, they're going to say we won and give us free stuff. TRS is going to want to maintain a positive image with what community is left, and saying "sorry, you guys didn't do well enough, no free skins this time" would leave some people disappointed. I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad thing, I just find it very hard to believe that the dwindling player base was able to land 1,000,000 rock throws in the span of 3 days.Am I the only one who thinks this?

I mean, it happens. If you try to run me over I'm going to try to stop you. Sometimes combat shotty is how I try, sometimes a rocket launcher is how I try. Anyway, if someone's personal vehicle is decked out, completely bulletproof with bulletproof tires, how are you supposed to kill them except for blowing up the vehicle? I think I just got 6 or 7 personal vehicle kills on these guys who all had armored cars and kept fighting me in them. Between my sticky bombs, prox mines and rocket launcher they all lost quite a few cars in the process. It just doesn't seem fair to punish me for blowing up their car, when that's basically the only option I had to fight back.

Got all the setups done with minimal drama, but I've now tried the final one about 20+ times. What's truly infuriating is how close I get before a teammate decides to troll. One time 3 of us had jumped from the plane and landed on the beach. We were waiting for the demoman to land, when he jumps out of the buzzard to skydive to the beach. Buzzard destroyed, mission failed. Then another last night, we got Rachovsky (however the hell you spell it) onto the plane, got away from the cops, and our fucking pilot puts out his landing gear and goes to the objective marker, except he goes to it at sea level and tries to land in the water. Oh my god when they work well heists are such an awesome concept, but I don't know if I'm cursed with troll teammates or idiotic ones. /endrantAnyone on PC looking to group up for heists? IIRC you get a bonus $1,000,000 if you do a heist with the same group through all the setups and everything.

Everything ran smoothly. Today, I go to play some Shadow of Mordor before work and am greeted with a whopping 15 fps when I load in. Normally I get a consistent 45-60 fps. Hmm, I thought, that's odd. Did some virus scans, turned off and opened the rig for a dusting and loaded it back up, still 15 fps. So i decided to try GTAV, same. I normally stay around 50-60 fps, now it's saying at a consistent 15 fps. Now I'm starting to maybe begin something that could be seen as the beginning of a minor freak out, overnight my i5 4440 and GTX 980 have gone from beasting games no problem to running them like my old laptop would. Anyone have any ideas what else I can do? E: Thank you all for the replies and trying to help. Obligatory https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_8Qi-P2jQgUpdating my GPU drivers seems to have fixed it. Now I just wonder how I was able to game last night with no problems when the update came out nearly a week ago. And why an update to optimize GTAV affected SoM so much.

39bqgx	-12116	1433959769	gameofthrones	[S5E9] So I finally saw the newest episode and I have one question...	Why so much Stannis hate? Yes, he did something cruel, but this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who had been watching the show. Stannis is doing what he has always done the entire time we've known him on the show: *everything and anything* he can to secure his birthright of the iron throne.I think the storyline with Stannis has been building to this for a while now. I remember back when they were going to torch Gendry, Stannis said something like "If a sacrifice isn't difficult, then it's not a real sacrifice"Yes, he made a difficult, hard, even cruel decision, but he did it *for the greater good*. You think Ramsay or Roose would have a moments hesitation if Melisandre told them "hey I can guarantee your victory and ascension to the Iron Throne, but you have to burn one of your kids alive"? They would be all for it, no questions asked. Actually, they would ask "hey, is it cool if I flay them first *then* burn them later?" Stannis killed his own brother, burned several of his loyal followers alive, all because he thought it was a necessary evil for the greater good. This was just him continuing down that road, we'll see where it leads him. Fingers crossed we get to see Ramsay's head on a spike next episode but I'm not holding my breath

This is setting the wrong kind of milestone, there's a reason no other game has ever had two season passes before, because it is a *fucking stupid thing to do!*/endrant Edit to respond to some stuff: Yes, the fine print of the "season pass" says it will only contain the T4 characters, I would say calling that a "season pass" is borderline shady advertising. They know damn well that the current standard is for a season pass to include *all* the DLC for their game. The only example of another game doing something like this, AFAIK, is Borderlands 2 releasing some extra DLC that wasn't included in the season pass. There's a few major differences between that and what TRS is doing:A) Time, this non season pass DLC came out, IIRC, over a year after the game's launch. Evolve launched *four months ago* and they have already crammed in more DLC than other games do in a year or two.  B) Content, all the DLC in BL2 adds entire new areas, characters and quests to do. The amount of content you get from a BL2 DLC vs Evolve DLC isn't even a comparison. C) Pricing. Some of you are pointing out how plenty of other games have similar pricing ranges in their DLC content. While this is true, the vast majority of games you see charging this much for DLC will be charging that much because they *don't cost anything to purchase*. Evolve had a large $60 price tag just for the base game, add $50 for both "season passes" ($25 each) and another $30 for both monsters ($15 a pop) and you've spent $140 on a game in order to access all the content.This is only made worse by the lack of any kind of ranked play and the fact that there is no kind of progression once you hit lvl 40. Your only option for new content is to buy it, and THB getting to lvl 40 in this game doesn't even take that long. That or you can slowly grind out improvements to your existing characters/abilities.

I drop the scaling back to 100% and play a few rounds, and like that I can still get 35 FPS, but when I check my GPU monitor it's at a solid 100% GPU load. Wtf is going on here?

I would be happy just knowing what area's are getting the most attention and a timeline of when the ETA on certain fixes is, or if there are even going to be specific fixes rather than one enormous "fix everything" patch It's been almost two weeks since the PC version "launched" and was pulled, and aside from the one update that just fixed a few crashes they haven't done or said anything else.WB pls

I'm going to be moving in a few months, and having seen some horror pics of what happens when you ship your rig I think I'm just going to take it with me. I'm thinking this, take everything out of my case and put it in their respective boxes. Only one I don't still have the box for is the CPU so I'll probably just leave it in the MOBO (that should be fine right) and put those in one of my carry on bags.Then the case, maybe the PSU as well, I'll put into my checked clothes bag, and put clothes both around and inside the case so it doesn't bounce around too much.

I'm thinking I could leave most of the stuff just in the case and put it in a sturdy carry on bag. I was thinking I would remove the: GPU, CPU heatsink, RAM and possibly the HDDs. I think the MOBO and PSU should be fine in there and the CPU should be safe as long as it's held in place by the bracket. Then maybe to be extra safe put some clothes around the outside of the case. I'm probably going to have to bite the bullet and buy a new monitor there, not sure if I want to spend the extra money to put it in a checked bag, let alone how I could make sure it wouldn't be damaged. What do you guys think? Any better ideas or anything I'm wrong about?

3e5bgk	-12116	1437530250	shadowofmordor	Has anyone else noticed this?	Once you get max level (or close to it) it seems like captains *never* survive "dying" anymore. I've gone really out of my way to kill about 3/4 of the captains in Nurem without decapitating them, yet one by one they all get replaced by new captains. The only thing close to it I'll get is every now and again I'll get a new captain called "*something* bag-head", and when i first meet him he will shout something along the lines of "YOU! You did this to me! I'll kill you!" So I guess maybe it's supposed to be some random Uruk I killed that survived and went on to become a captain or something...but even super tough, level 20 captains with combat mastery who killed me a few times, when I finally kill them (sans decapitation), their body stays in the Sauron's Army page for a while, but they all seem to get replaced by new captains. I swear when I was a lower level captains would come back every second time I killed one, is it supposed to be like this now that I'm maxed out? When you're more powerful orcs have less of a chance to survive?

IIRC Just Cause 2 was a decent PC port, but that had Square Enix/Eidos as the publisher, not WB. Now, some of you might say that given the *huge* amount of public shaming WB just got for the Arkham Knight PC "port" they must be taking this more seriously, but I'm still very wary.

3hw8ap	-12116	1440190511	planetaryannihilation	If you like Titans, please, give it a good review on Steam	Even though it has mostly positive reviews, all the "most helpful" ones are from people complaining about how they made a stand alone expansion. Like they never heard of Forged Alliance, Brood War, Frozen Thrones, or Heart of the Swarm/Legacy of the Void. If you don't like the game itself, fair enough, but lets try to counter these people giving an RTS bad reviews for doing what RTS games *have always done*If you see negative reviews complaining about this rather than *actual gameplay issues and/or not liking the game* please tag them as "unhelpful" Not to mention that none of these new units were ever promised or mentioned by Uber, so when people bitch that "Uber said all the PA updates would be free", this isn't something that falls into that category. Lets help keep this great new game alive.
3hwozz	-12116	1440198161	personalfinance	Question regarding FAFSA you guys might be able to help with.	Sorry in advance if this is the wrong sub to ask this in.Anyway, so for the last 3 years I've been going to community college part time while working full time. Finished off most of my Gen Ed requirements and am now going full time to a University and working part time. While I was doing part time community college, FAFSA not only paid all my school bills with grants, they also gave me a bit of spending money for life expenses. Not much, about $500 a semester IIRC. Now that I'm going to a University full time and working less, I had expected FAFSA to help out more than before, but it's the opposite. Instead of grants, they offered me two loans. A subsidized loan of about $2,500 over the this and the following semester, and an unsubsidized loan of $3,500 over the same period. I decided to decline both of them since it's just money out of my pocket same as if I paid tuition. I'm just wondering why FAFSA would all of a sudden help me less now that I'm going to school more (and at a university vs a community college) and working (earning) less. It makes no sense to me.

3i1v31	-12116	1440307815	witcher	Playing for the first time in a while because of NG+, but now I'm getting &lt;25 fps on a GTX 980...	Played through the first time with no issues, have a graphics mod installed (IIRC it's the E3FX one, it was the most popular one on http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/?). Wasn't a stable 60fps but it was more than playable, usually around 40 fps.Now...well, like I said in the title. Can't play unless I lower a lot of graphics settings, which I shouldn't really have to do with a GTX 980. The only real difference between now and the last time I played is now I have Win 10, was 8.1 before. Win 10 caused a slight performance dip in some of my games, but nothing this bad. Anyone else having this issue or know how to fix it? I've checked my drivers are up to date, validated the game files, and like I said, my other games are running just fine. It seems to only be W3

pq0l7	-12121	1329269552	linuxquestions	Reallocated Sector Count	BACK STORY: This morning Windows 7 would not boot (after a failed video driver update) and I could not repair/restore so I decided to do a clean install. Unfortunately I deleted ALL of my partitions(I was distracted), and then could not get my Windows boot disc to load.  I then deemed it time for Ubuntu.I tried to install Ubuntu on the computer. After the installation the kernel would not start, so booted from a flash drive.  Shortly after I get that going, SMART pops up and tells me "Disk failure is imminent".  I take a look at things and the only bit that is failing is my Reallocated Sector Count (Values are Normalized 29; Worst 29; Threshold: 140, Value 1364 sectors).QUESTION: Is this something I really should be concerned about? Is my HD really about to die? Did I even make sense there?  I'm very new to linux and kind of groping about blindly here.System: Dell Studio XPS, 2.4GHZ dual core, 320GB 7200 RPM SATA Hard Drive, the hardware is about 2.2 years old.

I think it could be a scam.**I received a email with a potential job offer yesterday after submitting my resume for a job posting via Monster.  The email was thus:&gt; We have 7 of our company's laptops (HP dv2500)for upgrading/reformatting, advice if both is part of your service line . All that is needed of you is to remove Trojan virus that attacked all seven computers and reinstall AVG anti virus, And i want you to upgrade all computers from window vista Business to windows 7 professional. I have back up files for all computers,they have been attacked by various Trojan. Kindly advise the service charges for each of the 7 laptop computers and a price quote asap.All computers are the same model,AVG anti virus is most preferred (would appreciate a better option based on your advice).Windows 7 Professional Cd's and License keys will be provided for the installation process.Do bear in mind that this is a long term contract,this is basis of determining your performance level and eligibility. Your best service charge and advice is highly anticipated.Looking forward to read from you.The language and technical level of work seemed a bit rudimentary to me but I responded appropriately, detailing what could and should be done, an estimate of time and money (I had no idea about) etc. and got back:&gt;Thank you for the prompt response,all that is required of you is to clean/remove Trojan virus that attacked all seven computers, reinstall AVG anti virus and upgrade all computers from Windows vista Business to Windows 7 professional. Thank you for the price,a total of [$$$]. Instructions will be dished out to one of our clients near you to mail to you the payment/your charges which will be in form of a Cashiers check. Please do get back to me with your name and mailing address for the purpose of payment and laptops delivery to you as soon as the shipping agent gets all of the faulty units together from our various offices. Also the payment will be in amount of your money for repairing the system and shipment fee to dispatch the devices down to your location and you will deduct your service charge and have all the rest money sent to the shipping agent via Western Union or Money gram depending on whichever is closest to you.Again something smells fishy to me. I checked out the company and it turns out they develop high-end Fortran compilers.  It would seem that there is somebody there that could do this task far quicker and easier than I, and without the hassle of sending it to somebody you've never met or even spoken to, halfway across the country. The gentelman whose name is attached to everything shows up on linked in and seems legit, but I couldn't be certain.  So I ask does this scream of a Scam, or could it really be legit?

How does each individual member effect my team? Do I need a member from each position "active" in order to do well? How do I compete with other teams? Could I have multiple pitchers/quarterbacks active at once? Would I ever want to place somebody who doesn't "score" (like an offensive lineman?) on the team?I am particularly interested in fantasy baseball, but any sport will do.

It was described as a local co-op for 7 or 8 players in which everybody is part of a command, like the bridge on Star Trek. Each player is responsible for a particular system (life support, navigation, weapons, communication, etc.) and has their own readout on a private screen.  The particularly interesting part of this is that one player acts at the captain, and does not get their own console but can have other players share what they see and helps direct the team on their missions, although I do not recall what kinds of objectives the game has.I don't remember if I saw it on here or heard it on the Video Games Hot Dog podcast, but has anybody heard of such a thing, or better yet can recall its name?

I go out to move my car tonight, and it's not there. Called up the police department and they told me it was towed. I'm 95% sure I last had it parked on the correct side. When I asked why it was towed I was told it didn't say and she gave me the name of the towing company to call. Where do I go from here?  I believe I was legally parked, and the police have nothing saying how I was parked illegally, just that I was towed.  When I call the company I'm not going to tell them any of this, just going to ask them why it was towed.  If they don't have a reason either, how to I go about not paying the fees.  Heck, even if they do give a reason is there anything I can do?  It's just their word against mine, since the police have no record of it.

I've seen posts where someone says they're well off, making $65k a year, and then someone will comment saying that's hardly a good salary. So:1. Off the top of your head, what would you personally consider a good salary?2. Briefly comment (can be a simple one word answer, or a little more in depth if you would like) about each of the following salary levels - $30K - $40K - $65K  - $80k - $100k - $140k - $200k3.

1zxkw3	-12130	1394327355	nfl	Before you shout that some team overpaid, remember this	The salary cap keeps increasing.Obviously most of us know that already, but it seems like there are a lot of people who need to be reminded that a higher cap means higher contracts for players.It does not make sense to compare the contracts that this year's free agents are getting to contracts given out in the past.  The only valid comparison for contracts is between players of the same free agent class.  Stop with the "Sam Shields is now the third highest paid CB; the Packers way overpaid".  He's paid more than most other CBs because his contract is newer.  As long as the cap keeps increasing going forward, every corner who is comparable to Shields will make more than he just got.  By 2016 when the cap is at $160 million, paying Shields $10 million a year will look like a steal.   Teams keep getting more cap space, but they still only get 53 players on their active roster.   There's no way to use that money without giving players bigger contracts, therefore, every time the cap increases, so will the value of the contracts given out to free agents.

He goes apeshit crazy after that and kills a shit ton of people for no reason. Deb gets her big nose in the way once again so he has no choice but to take that bitch out. For two weeks or so Dexter just relaxes on his boat and enjoys some brews. Then, in his drunken stupor, he realizes what a cunt LaGuerta has always been so he goes down to the office and stabs her in plain daylight. Obviously he's caught after that, and the series ends as Dexter enters the prison showers for the first time.

Does that make sense?It was a show that I very much enjoyed, but I didn't laugh all that much while watching.  However now that I've finished I always chuckle thinking back on the jokes.  The show I think is the best comparison for this kind of thing is Frisky Dingo.  "We can't ever go back to Arizona".  While watching the episode it's just a dumb joke, but I can't help but smile to myself whenever I think of that now.  A more well known comparison that kind of fits is Arrested Development, although not as closely.  While you're watching the jokes are enjoyable and funny, but once they get rooted in your mind it goes to a whole 'nother level.I've noticed, that for me at least, this is what makes a great show.  It's one that I'll probably like even more on my second watchthrough.  I don't know, maybe I'm just drunk (I am drunk) and not making any sense, but this is how I feel about the show, and makes me think season 2 can be incredible.

While he's one of the greatest defensive coordinators of all time, he might not hold that position next year.  He's 77 years old.  Teams might not want implement a new defense for a guy who will only be around a couple more years.  He might not even want that kind of responsibility in his next job.So he could be looking for a job as a defensive assistant or consultant.  What better spot than Green Bay?  We run a very similar scheme and Lebeau was the defensive backs coach under Dom Capers for Pittsburgh in the early 90s.I don't want to get my hopes up too high, but this is definitely a possibility I can see happening.

q5qy4	-12135	1330198654	auto	Is there a true sequential (i-pattern) transmission that retains normal full-time clutch use?	I really am fascinated by sequential transmissions (the real ones, not those sissy auto tiptronic things) and i am looking for a specific type.  I recall finding something that simply changed the shift lever mechanism into a simple I-pattern without changing the clutch use.  From what i can gather most mechanical sequential transmissions change clutch use to only for standing starts and (i think) downshifts on some setups.  I know nothing about motorcycles but i think that many have a sequential while still using clutch for each gear.Does such a type exist for a car that only changes the lever pattern without changing the clutch? TLDR: Sequential type without changing clutch use; Fact or fiction?Thank you all.

He was deviating from his normal process and instead of working on single aspects on a whole batch he made a single pair of jeans over a whole day.

My final project itself was only ten of these, but i added in a bunch more that i liked. I hope y'all enjoy!http://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/sets/72157633441725072/
1j6qun	-12135	1374967264	rawdenim	Anybody tried to DIY dye something indigo?	I have this Levis trucker jacket in grey rigid that I got off amazon as a sort of experiment for my first denim jacket. I've ended up doing a lot of alterations to it to get a nice custom fit for my swimmer shoulders (darting and back cinch) that I'm really happy with so far. I really love the grey color since i can avoid the double denim look. However, my brother thought of the idea of overdyeing the jacket to a darker color and I think that might be a fun and interesting project to try. Does anybody have experience or knowledge of how to go about doing this? Or perhaps reasons I shouldn't bother. TLDR; how can I overdye my grey jacket?

So far I can only find a black Type III from Iron Heart but no black Type II. Is there perhaps an older production from them (or any other company) that included a black Type II? If any of y'all know of something that fits this criteria I would really appreciate it. 
1mnl46	-12135	1379525764	rawdenim	With unsanforized denim, is it acceptable to do only a cold pre-soak if i never plan to do a hot soak in the future?	I'm about to order the N&amp;F 32oz monsters and the measurements should be good post soak, but I'm thinking of my options in terms of flexibility with the amount of shrinkage. If i decide that I want a *slight* bit more room all around, is it an option to just do a cold pre-soak instead of a hot pre-soak? I don't see myself needing to do hot soaks in the future so I thought that might be an option just to maintain some flexibility with the measurements before i commit to them. Any input/experience would be greatly appreciated.TLDR; cold pre-soak only on unsanforized raws; is it a bad idea?

WARNING: THIS [ALBUM](http://imgur.com/a/1tbCF) IS FREAKING HUGEI took a ton of photos because i wanted y'all to get a better idea of the way it actually looks despite the inconsistent exposure and white balance.For reference, here is an album of some [fit pics](http://imgur.com/a/6pxyH) with it.I got a message this morning asking for some  progress pics of my IH wabash western shirt, so I figured now was a good time to make an actual progress post of it. My nikon is getting cleaned in preparation of me upgrading my whole system, so all i had was my Nexus 7. The exposures were pretty finicky so i apologize for the erratic changes throughout the album. As for the shirt, I love it. My brother is a huge IH fan and last christmas he gave me a voucher to put towards an iron heart product of my choice. It is my favorite shirt I own and i wish i could wear it every day. Unfortunately it's pretty heavy and in Texas, i can only wear it in the mornings when the AC in my office isn't battling the heat of the afternoon. However, it was a godsend in Chicago for school. During the winters if it was 20F or more i was comfy wearing only this and my IH 21oz vest, even with the wind. I think that this shirt is one of the most interesting shirts ive found. * 12oz* indigo/indigo* left hand twill* patterned* red interior stitchingThe most amazing thing about this shirt, in my opinion, is the fact that the pattern is perfectly lined up on every panel from top to bottom, front to back. It blows my mind when i look at it and see that every dot lines up perfectly. I love this level of construction.This shirt has gotten me hooked on Iron Heart, and I am constantly lusting after their new and old items. 
2acceg	-12135	1405008923	rawdenim	What about a jeans + username directory list?	I know we have flairs that show our current rotation, but what if we had a searchable list of all the pairs we own as a sub? For example, I'm wanting to find fade pics/more info on the Left Field Black Marias. I remember there is at least one person who has them on here but I can't remember who. I don't want to unnecessarily clutter the sub with another "anybody know how ___ fades?" So that got me thinking... Is there anything like this already?I was thinking it might be very useful for people who, e.g. want to know more about the 32oz or LF sweats, they can see my username next to those pairs and they can look at my picture posts or message me about them without making a whole thread on it. I also think it would just be interesting to have a list showcasing all of the various pairs we own as a whole. Perhaps we could even link progression threads to the usernames so that you could click and see progression for a specific pair of jeans that you're interested in. Sorry this is kinda disjointed but I thought it might be useful and fun for the sub. Let me know what y'all think!

I saw the Edo Ai denim on there and knew I had to have something made of denim with 50% sugar cane fiber. After throwing some ideas back and forth with /u/mfarmtown, we came up with some general specs and eventually purchased the fabric. She did a couple eras of a test shirt out of duck while we were both still in Chicago to get the fit how i liked it, and during this past summer she spent her free time between store orders [working on my shirt](http://imgur.com/nHCtVs7). &amp;nbsp;I received it exactly [a month ago](http://imgur.com/DoCsRTq) and have done my best to wear it and break it in before the Texas summer truly takes hold and tries to kill me. Anyways, time for the photos I took last night. I waited until now because I wanted to get a bit of molding in it before i posted. Let's take the tour...&amp;nbsp;It's the SC 40500 fabric, a 14.25oz unsanforized selvedge denim from Sugar Cane made with 50% cotton fibers and 50% sugar cane fibers. It is [extremely textured](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17262858763/sizes/l) and rough to the touch with little sugar cane stalk? pieces that add a definite itch factor before they get abraded out of the fabric. There's a cool [variation in color](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17260819014/sizes/l) throughout the fabric and it has a green/emerald caste to it. /u/mfarmtown and I decided it would be best to just presoak the fabric before construction of the shirt since we weren't familiar with the way it would shrink once formed into [a shirt](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17884276545/sizes/l). &amp;nbsp;I decided to go with a [spread collar](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17884004225/sizes/l) design and she even managed to put some cool [collar stay slots](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17880746072/sizes/l) on the underside. &amp;nbsp;Next are the [pockets](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17857780926/sizes/l) which I designed myself, and she liked the design so much she decided to use it in her next run of shirts! I feel pretty proud of that one. On the left pocket is also a selvedge [sunglasses loop](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17263528993/sizes/l) courtesy of the mind of /u/chronicelectronic. &amp;nbsp;When /u/mfarmtown was at Denim Bruin many moons ago, she asked Roy Slaper to do one of his custom felt embroidered patches for me and I asked her to make it into an [inner pocket](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17880804122/sizes/l) on the shirt. &amp;nbsp;There is [a lot of selvedge](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17695357990/sizes/l) on this shirt: sleeves, back, cuffs, side gussets, and button plackets. The selvedge sleeves contain one of my favorite details on the shirt, the point where [it all comes together](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17695346308/sizes/l). I'm not sure why, but this intersection always captures my attention whenever I look inside. &amp;nbsp;The [buttons](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17260992794/sizes/l) are made of coconut and she used ["denim" thread](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17857339946/sizes/l) throughout. The thread has a metallic indio color to it which I think will pop nicely once it fades.  &amp;nbsp;I love the felled seams. They have a slight bulge in the center that reminds me of raised belt loops. They have a [different look](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17262974873/sizes/l) that I really like compared to the machine felled seams on my other shirts. And check out the cool [grosgrain tag](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17260705754/sizes/l)!&amp;nbsp;This thing looks amazing [inside out](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gregorypfaff/17879879762/sizes/l) and any time i take it off i find myself opening it up and looking around the inside just to see how things are molding and changing with wear. &amp;nbsp;This shirt is a really entertaining piece. It gets softer every day and I can't wait to get it to finally drape and fade down the line. Unfortunately this denim is all gone as far as we can tell so no more of these sugar cane beasts will be coming out in the future. Any questions y'all have please feel free to ask and I or /u/mfarmtown will do our best to answer. &amp;nbsp;Thanks for reading!
3aslv6	-12135	1435033625	tequila	Clase Azul Plata Review	This is my first attempt at a review so hopefully it is adequate. Thanks to y'all I have gotten increasingly into tequila when i ventured over from bourbon a while ago. Tequila has really fascinated me since getting into it and I decided to venture outside of the añejos and try to experience [that true agave flavor](http://imgur.com/4ggYdTT). &amp;nbsp;**Nose after pour:** Sweet agave, the first time I’ve really isolated pure agave in a tequila. Vegetable notes, very specifically remind me of dried vegetable chips where the sweetness and earthiness is intensified from the dehydration process. Warm but not fiery, butter aroma and texture far back near the sinuses. Well balanced, nothing really pushes any of the other flavors out of the way. Light salt, slight musk.&amp;nbsp;**First taste:** Light when it first hits the tongue, sweet with a good weight to it, not too thin. After it moves over the tongue the warmth opens up, but nothing piercing. Earthy flavors, slight bitterness on the back roof of the mouth after swallowing, slight pucker on the middle and rear of the tongue.&amp;nbsp;**Next taste after a few sips of water:** The sweetness is not as forward as before and the deeper flavors are coming out. Extremely balanced, sweetness fades after the foretaste and opens up to a full earthy flavor. I’m not sure if I’m noticing smoke or not but definitely a darker earthy flavor coming through.&amp;nbsp;**Nose after opening up:** a good bit of bell pepper, more salt is apparent, slight mint and menthol&amp;nbsp;Extremely smooth body and pleasantly dry finish with a comforting warmth. This would be easy to drink quickly if i didn’t keep remembering how expensive it was.&amp;nbsp;I’m a little hesitant to put a number score here considering I have never sipped a blanco before. My only experience is with añejos and a couple reposados so this was a new realm for me. If I had to I would say 8 or 9/10. It left nothing to be desired flavor wise, had a nose I could happily enjoy all day, but is double the price of a bottle I would typically get. However, the beautiful bottle alone is worth having just because [its beautiful](http://imgur.com/g6o4YNR) and a great conversation piece. I’m not experienced enough in blancos to know for sure when compared to other blancos, but I think I’d agree I’m getting close to double the enjoyment out of this one bottle as opposed to a ~$40 bottle. I have no regrets.Thank you for taking the time to read through my first review!

The charity is called the Torino Foundation. These are 4 day camps, but they are accepting volunteers and workers for as many or few days as you can help out for. It's a ton of fun and completely free (including 3 meals per day, room and board, and all activities), and at a beautiful ranch about an hour outside of Vegas where the weather is amazing. The volunteers get to either be a counselor and sort of take care of a few kids, or an activities person and help out at the different activities around the camp, like the rock climbing wall. The paid workers help with making sure the camp is clean, collecting trash, cleaning the cabins, etc. If you want any other info, check out http://www.torinofoundation.org/  or feel free to comment or message me.

To break it down,-I meditate on a regular basis, outdoors when possible since I find it extremely comforting -I tend to feel that the Earth is more then just...well the Earth, if that makes sense at all-I spend hours just thinking about the Universe and what could be out there-The idea of a "God" that is depicted in Catholicism/Islam/Judaism etc just doesn't jive with me/makes very little senseSorry if the above seems confusing, it's hard to formulate what I'm thinking into a list. I really do think I am a Pantheist and I appreciate any help in clarifying my situation. :)

1ftchn	-12214	1370550361	letlive	Is anyone else tired of seeing letlive getting classed in with bands that kind of suck?	Like honestly, I've seen a few people try to suggest me OM&amp;M, AA!, Falling in Reverse, Pierce The Veil, and a few others just because I love letlive. It just bothers me considering how they don't sound anything like the others besides having screamed vocals, and the vocals don't even sound remotely similar.I know they are finally starting to tour with good bands (Deftones, As Cities Burn, did Underoath's farewell tour, etc.), but the bands they get classed in with blow, most of the time.What bands would you class them in with? I'd say most definitely Glassjaw, At The Drive-In (if they still existed), Deftones, or at the very least, Norma Jean (Redeemer era). I'm honestly just looking for more bands with that raw hardcore sound.Don't say Glassjaw, I already follow them religiously.

1izmez	-12214	1374706500	GrandTheftAutoV	Get your creative juices flowing; create a unique multiplayer mode for GTA V and describe it.	Hey guys! Just to get amped up for GTA V, I thought it'd be cool to see some unique ideas for game modes on the multiplayer!I'll start us off:Game Type: *Rampage*The game will have 3 rounds, one of the 16 players will randomly become the "target". The target must kill as many civilians and cops as he can before the time limit hits or before he is killed. The target will be hunted down by the other 15 players who are cops. The cops will have high powered weapons but weak health, the target will have low powered weapons but extremely powerful health that doesn't regenerate.Whoever does the most damage to the target or whoever kills the target will become the target next round.The player with the most points at the end of the game will become the winner.Killing civilians as cops will result in point deductions.My idea is basically Payne Killer from Max Payne 3 but with a lone wolf twist. Let's hear your ideas!

So this has been bothering me and I don't know why, so I figured I should ask you guys so you could ease my mind.R* stated that they will be pushing the limits of the current gen consoles and I have one of the first models of the 360 (Premium version). It freezes every once and a while, but never red rings and still hasn't. My console pulled through Max Payne 3 and LA Noire, which were huge. I guess my question is that do you think my console could handle GTA V?You can downvote me if its a stupid question, it's just been bothering me. Been waiting for GTA V for 2 years and I don't want Ol' Faithful pooping out on me.

29htnk	-12215	1404154039	orchids	First timer... help please?	Bought [this] (http://i.imgur.com/nxB1Q5W.jpg) orchid several months ago. It's been kept at a south-facing window with medium light, planted in sphagnum moss and in a clear plastic container with drainage holes at the bottom.What I'm worried about right now is that its [roots] (http://i.imgur.com/UJX2Jtv.jpg) look like they're rotting, but it's only the [top half] (http://i.imgur.com/WmdZ66S.jpg); the bottom half look [fine](http://i.imgur.com/tnE8ghr.jpg). The entire root is still firm, but doesn't look good. I'm not sure what's causing it - I've never kept the plant soaking wet, and water it about once a week once the moss dries out. I water by running water through the pot until the media is wet, then allow it to drain without letting the plant sit in the water. No ice cubes here!Or is it the opposite problem and the plant is actually drying out? The leaves are starting to wrinkle, and the roots are quite dry.What should I do to keep this plant alive? Also, any tips for a beginner?

One day I had an excruciating sinus headache and just couldn't take it anymore. I went to my bathroom, turned on the sink and shower to its hottest setting and shut the door.

I can't describe the feeling as my pain was relinquished. It was amazing.

I'm not accustomed to coming home at 830/9 on a Friday night. Now, I should preface I live in Chicago and we have "Tamale Guys". These are Mexican gentleman that carry Igloo coolers into bars and call out, "TAMALES" selling them to drunk patrons in prepackaged delicousness. On my way home this past Friday, starving and looking forward to going home and relaxing, I encountered one of these gentleman near a bar as I walking home from the train. Well, I should say I THOUGHT he was one. As I came upon him I heartily exclaimed, "I'll take one!". I received a very confused look and a "I'm sorry, what?" in a very Americanized accent. "Are you selling tamales?" as I pointed to his igloo cooler. "Uh, no. Wha-This is my lunch box." My cheeks instantly turned hot as I realized I just assumed this guy with a lunch pail, not unlike myself, was selling tamales because he looked Mexican. "Omigod! I'm so sorry!" I was mortified. He realizes and starts laughing. "Oh, wow! It's cool, man." We had a little laugh and walked our separate ways.  I can't tell you how greatful I was that he wasn't offended. I felt like a huge idiot. TLDR: I assumed a Mexican looking guy with an igloo cooler was selling tamales. Turns out, just a working dude like me with his lunch box.

zo5bj	-12242	1347309077	dogs	Lacey Ponders Positives and Negatives of Raw Food (BARF) Diet	  I always wondered if a raw diet is good for me or not. I know some of my doggie friends swear by it; they claim it’s the healthiest way to go. I was not sure about this, so I decided to do some research on this topic.  One of my friends told me about a raw diet called the BARF diet (Biologically Appropriate Raw Food). The BARF diet is composed of human grade food including: raw meat, ground up bones, and other healthy ingredients, including fruit and vegetables. The BARF diet focuses on returning dogs to their evolutionary roots and eating from the Earth. Followers of the BARF diet claim they live longer and when they eat bones, they have cleaner teeth with no periodontal disease. They also claim they have better digestion and major reductions in obesity and also have healthier immune systems. All of this sounds wonderful to me but what are the negatives of this diet?  I did some research on the downside of this BARF diet and there seems to be just about as many dangers as benefits.  Many veterinary specialists warn against the diet. Bones can perforate the gastrointestinal tract; this may lead to peritonitis, which usually involves severe infections. Even when the bones are ground up, they still can be very dangerous; they can fracture teeth and they can block or tear the throat or stomach. Bones that are raw also may contain, food borne pathogens, including salmonella. Supermarkets uncooked raw meats can be very dirty, having plenty of time and surface contact and contact with other meats to spread disease. There are even cases of humans being infected during the preparation. There is a greater chance to get a bacterial infection from RAW foods. The majority of this diet is fine and most likely very healthy but there is a chance of getting infected food which I am not sure I am willing to risk.  I am not sure how I feel about this diet; there are both risks of this diet and benefits. However, my instincts tell me to stay on my doggie food from the pet store that I currently eat. The BARF diet may be healthier but it’s just not worth the risk of getting very sick or possibly dying from a bacterial infection.  I would like to know what you guys and girls think about Raw Foods for us doggies and the BARF diet?(Full Article found at www.laceysbarkery.com/blog)
zp13j	-12242	1347340522	dogs	Nutritious Dog Meals Made At Home	Dogs can be thought of as “adaptavores.” They do not need a meat-free diet and they do not need a diet with meat. Dogs can be healthy as omnivores or as vegans, just like humans can. Furthermore, dogs and humans can be healthy with and without any cooked food in their diet.The only thing that has to be considered when making home-made dog treats is whether or not the item is toxic to dogs.Foods that you should never feed your dog:Alcohol, apple seeds, apricot pits, cherry pits, peach pits, plum pits, avocados, baking soda, baking powder, caffeinated substances, cacao (dogs can’t have theobromine), citrus oils (usually found as additives in food or household products), grapes, raisins, currants, macadamia nuts, cow’s milk (due to the pasturization and poor diet of conventionally raised cows), moldy food, mushrooms, soy and soy products, mustard seeds, nutmeg, onions, potatoes, rhubarb, table salt, green (unripe) tomatoes, xylitol, sweeteners of all kinds (such as agave, corn syrup, brown sugar, maltitol, etc), dough, and yeast.Foods that are not toxic, but that I don’t recommend feeding your dog at all:Grains such as wheat, quinoa, barley, buckwheat, oats, etc, pastaFoods that can be fed to your dog once in a great while:Raw eggs, garlic, sea saltFoods to be limited somewhat:Fatty foods (seeds, nuts, oils), ripe tomatoes (dogs should never have unripe tomatoes or moldy tomatoes), flax seedsDogs should not have the following foods if they have arthritis:Tomatoes, eggplant, and peppersIf you adhere to the above lists, then you can make your dog a treat from virtually any other whole foods you have in your kitchen. Dogs tend to love mangoes, bananas, carrots, celery and apples. Dogs that are eating dog-food loaded with grains may take a while to adapt to a more natural diet.It should be noted that parsley, celery and dandelion leaves are good for your dog but will make them pee more often. If you’re not keen on going on extra walks during the day or will be away that day, then make sure those items are not included in the meals you make them.Most dogs like fresh juice. If you own a juicer and make juice for yourself, consider sharing the juice with your dog (as long as your juice is dog-safe of course). The juice pulp can be saved to make dog treats through dehydration or baking.For example, you can blend (in your food processor) six to eight cups of pulp from making juice (leave out citrus pulp as it might contain citrus oil) with two cups of raw seeds. At least one cup of seeds should be chia seeds or flax seeds to keep the crackers bound together. (Flax and chia seeds become gelatinous when fluid is added.)Note: Do not feed your dog (or yourself) flax seeds in large volume on a daily basis as flax seeds contain trace amounts of a toxin that can build up in your system. (1-5 tablespoons of flax seeds daily is okay for a human, but generally assume that both you and your dog shouldn’t have more than one cup of flax seeds per week each.)After blending vegetable pulp and seeds in your food processor with water, spread the pulp on a teflex dehydrator sheet to a quarter inch thick. Dehydrate at 140 degrees F for an hour and then reduce the temperature to 110 degrees F overnight. Flip as soon as you can flip without breaking the sheets. Continue to dehydrate at 105 degrees F in the morning. Break into pieces and see how your dog likes them.If your dog doesn’t like the particular mix, they can be blended with a food your dog likes (or a food you like) to create a new meal for your dog (or you). For example, if your dog seems to love carrots and wet-sloppy dishes, you could soak the crackers in a little water for twenty minutes and then blend the watery cracker bits with carrots. For yourself (but not for your dog) you could blend the crackers with raisins and apple chunks to make a lunch.(Full Article at http://laceysbarkery.com/blog/)

The BreedThe dog’s breed is a very important point to consider when adopting a dog. While the dog will have an individual personality and character traits, the breed’s temperament and characteristics can still give you an idea of what to expect.2. The SourceThere are plenty of places you can go to when looking for a dog to adopt. There are the rescue groups, the animal shelters, and local humane societies for dogs. These have individual preferences about the dogs they take in, which should give you an idea of what to expect in the dogs they shelter.An animal shelter should be your first choice when adopting a dog. Adopting from an animal shelter ensures you are saving a dog’s life. However, animal shelters don’t necessarily keep track of the dog’s history so if you care about it being pure bred this may not be ideal for you.Rescue groups keep a history of the dog and any previous owners. A rescue group is the best place for you to adopt if you are interested in knowing your dogs history. Rescue groups are very specific about the breeds they accept and they shelter their dogs in actual homes instead of kennels.3. Your HomeYour home environment is a crucial factor when considering the dog you are adopting. Some breeds are not comfortable in small and confined places, others are are not suitable for families with children.If you have kids in the family, think carefully about the type of dog you want to adopt. Big dogs should not be around children at all as they could be hurt. But on the other hand, smaller dogs are more likely to be abused by children.Be sure to check into the policies of the neighborhood you are living in. If you are living in an apartment, check with your apartment owner for their pet regulations.Make sure you consider all these factors before you adopt a dog, as you don’t want to adopt the perfect dog only to have to take it back due to your environment not being suitable. Whether you’re thinking of adopting a puppy, small dogs for adoption or really thinking of adopting any canine up for adoption, you should be looking to adopt rescue dogs from an adoption shelter.First, you’re helping the canine population in general. Usually, rescue dogs are at the bottom of dog society – while no one wants to see a dog abused or a dog abandoned, it happens to these poor creatures regularly through no fault of their own. Many die, unfortunately, but a lot do make it to an adoption shelter. These rescue dogs so appreciate any kindness they’re shown and only need a good home with your loving family to move to the top of dog society as a much-beloved family pet!Phil ClarksonSource (http://laceysbarkery.com/blog/)

SummaryIntroverts, be the best version of yourself you can be, stop trying to be someone you are not.BodyI've been thinking the last few months and though it took a lot of mess-ups and a lot of really hard times that I created for myself over the years I've finally got a few things thoroughly thought out for the first time in my life.... One of these things is that there's no doubt I'm a highly introverted guy; sure I've come out of my shell a bit but I still enjoy introverted pursuits more then anything. Work alone, play alone alot, only socialize with a special few close friends. I prefer the so-called "mini-relationship" over lots of girls at once. Other introverts on here may agree with me on many of these things. Some may agree on my main point as well...It was around the time I stopped trying to be someone I'm absolutely not that things started going better for me in my life. I stopped being the weird clown guy that everyone laughs at and makes fun of and became the confident quiet guy whose opinion matters and who people wanted around. Maybe I won't be the center of attention at a club or house party ever but I don't really want to be either..... Women and men notice quiet confidence (especially when accompanied by good style and physical presence, ty red pill) in its own setting just as much as they do the powerful center of attention in the club. One is not better then there other each just thrives in different areas and following different persuits.Introverts, when trying to be someone they're not, often fall into the trap of being the weird guy who talks to much about nothing. Accept who you are and be yourself, you'll find positive change does happen. Just don't go the other direction of being the weird completely silent guy in the corner with no friends who stares at everyone, we have all been guilty of that too. Lesson's LearnedFind your happy medium, find your few close friends, find a hobby that doesn't involve WoW, find your own places to socialize and have fun!I'm still working on alot of this myself, I think writing it down will not only help others but myself as well.Thanks for reading!P.S.*LIFT*

I have the Bone Of The Ancients shock damage relic and the Legendary Mechromancer mod with a 61 Alkaline Bee. I also have a 61 Transformer and a 61 Black Hole but I've primarily been using the bee (I'd love a Grounded Bee one of these days). My usual strategy is to hit an enemy with a full stack of Outburst, then pop Deathtrap and slag him then go to town on mobs while my roommate hangs back and either keeps me up or removes nuisances from the field. I've found that it also works if I shock deathtrap so he knocks out shields and I can cut through most mobs like butter. Thoughts?

1s0zyc	-12302	1386109322	cripplingalcoholism	I Think I'm Spiraling	I've always joked around about having a "problem" but I'm starting to scare even myself. Last week my new roommate came over (he's still in between places and hasn't moved in all the way yet) and brought over a half gallon of Evan and a half gallon of Jager. He's ex-marine corps and going through marriage issues so he has been hitting the bottle incredibly hard recently and he knows how much I love whiskey so I've been helping him. We killed both half gallons over the next two days and he left to go do some work, came back with another bottle of Old Crow and some tequila and we went at it again. I spent the majority of last week blacked out or hungover and even kept drinking when the house was empty and I had nobody to drink with but myself. I think the winter and the holiday season is hitting me harder than usual because it's so close to so many bad memories. I even had the shakes recently when I was pouring a shot, my whole hand was shaking so bad I could barely pour or pick up the double shot I was trying to take before I ran off for a business meeting. I don't know what to do, because I feel like if I don't drink I'll just make the depression worse, at least when I drink I'm jovial and fun and I can laugh. I feel like I'm going down a spiral and I don't know if I'll come back up after winter or if I should legitimately be concerned. 
1v05sn	-12302	1389494663	cripplingalcoholism	A Recent Conversation...	I have amassed a reputation among my circle as the gutter alcoholic, apparently. I actually feel a sense of pride over it. Tonight I'm nursing a bottle of Bulleit and a case of Yuengling to myself while my housemates take acid. So cheers to my CA's and this beer's for you. A recent conversation: "Your impending alcoholism is worrisome but entertaining, it's like watching a slow trainwreck""Impending? That's a fucking insult."-in the background- "Impending?

2niwag	-12304	1417043241	EDH	How Grenzo became my #1 EDH Deck.	This is my first time creating a thread on Reddit. My first EDH deck was with Wort, Boggart Auntie and of course was black/red tribal Goblins. Then, Conspiracy gifted us with Grenzo and my imagination flared with dreams of shenanigans. So, here's a quick story of evolution, and then it's on to the list.I started off by changing my general to Grenzo, and toyed with creatures that had only power equal to his so I would have 100% hits on creatures revealed from the bottom of my library. This of course was still Tribal themed. It did well, but wasn't as explosive or potent as I thought it could be.. So, I decided to step away from Tribal completely and I did an extensive search on creatures that were black, red, or colorless whice had a power 3 or less (casting Grenzo for x=1). Their creature type didn't matter to me, but their ETB (enter the battlefield) triggers and abilities were what earned them a spot in the 99, and believe me, it's tight right now. After fine tuning the creatures, I then moved on to utility cards, mostly artifacts, leaving only a few spots for instant, sorcery and enchantments. I've been playing a lot with a group at my local game shop and everyone loves the synergy I've developed. Here's my list followed by a couple of examples of how it works.Lands: 31Bloodstained MireCommand TowerBojuka BogShadowblood RidgeDeserted TempleNykthos, Shrine to NyxCabal CoffersUrborg, Tomb of YawgmothDragonskull SummitTainted PeakBadlandsRakdos CarnariumSwamp x 8Sulfurous SpringsGraven CairnsBlood CryptMountains x 8Auntie's HovelCreatures: 53Grenzo, Dungeon Warden (the boss)Precursor GolemFleshbag MarauderGoblin Assassin (haha, it works!)Moggcatcher (fetch Kiki, start antics)Filth (when you need to win with the beatdown path and have Urborg in play)Soul of New Phyrexia (laugh at board-wipes)Krenko, Mob Boss (stupid with Purphoros)Goblin MatronGoblin LackeyPurphoros, God of the ForgeKiki-Jiki, Mirror BreakerPhyrexian DelverEmrakul's HatcherPawn of Ulamog (this guy actually puts in a lot of work with Ashnod's Altar or Viscera Seer)Junk DiverAngerDakmor LancerGoblin MarshalSengir AutocratChainier, Dementia MasterFurystoke Giant (this card is nuts)Archetype of Finality (combos well with Goblin Sharpshooter)Puppeteer Clique (puts in work!)Invader ParasiteFortune Thief (hilarious card)Myr RetrieverBalthor the Defiled (my allstar, my hero)Fleshwrither (fetches my win-cons)SangromancerDisciple of GriselbrandDeathbringer Thoctar (don't miss triggers and this guy gets huge enough to do some serious direct damage)Viashino Heretic (one of my faves, laughs at Grafdigger's Cage)Herald of Leshrac (if unanswered... just isn't fun)Mindclaw Shaman (now he can be played for just 2 colorless mana)Junktroller (recursion)Blood Artist (semi win-con)Goblin Welder (does nasty things)NekrataalTuktuk the ExplorerFledgling DragonSolemn Simulacrum (the most abused artifact in EDH)GuiltfeederGray Merchant of Asphodel (just gross)Goblin Sharpshooter (combos well with Archetype of Finality)Aether Membrane (just read it..)Viscera SeerSkirsdag High PriestRakdos Augermage (I play off the bottom of my library, what do I care what you make me discard?)Crypt Ghast (a beast with Urborg)Ignition Team (usually comes in to play with 20+ counters)Siege-Gang CommanderSadistic Hypnotist (nasty sac-outlet)Instant/Sorcery: 5DreadboreTerminateChaos Warp (one of our only defenses, card is just nuts)Demonic TutorDiabolic TutorEnchantments: 1Braid of Fire (if unanswered, gets nuts when activating Grenzo during your upkeep)Artifacts: 10Liquimetal Coating (Goblin Welder's toy, and a way for red to take care of pesky enchantments other threats)Urza's Incubator (when Grenzo gets expensive, or you have Kiki or Siege-Gang in hand, name GOblins of course)Illusionist's Bracers (broken.)Expedition Map (to piece together Cabal Coffers / Urborg / Deserted Temple)Ashnod's Altar (infinite combos with Siege-Gang, and Reito Lantern. Answers at instant speed)Darksteel Pendant (keep that land on top, put the fatty on the bottom, easy)Reito Lantern (helps you re-use your ETBs!)Heartstone (also broken, especially in combo'd with Illusionist's Bracers)Crystal Ball (a better Darksteel Pendant)Tel-Jilad Stylus (you can activate Grenzo, and with his trigger on the stack, tuck him, and pop him back out, but he will have no +1+1 counters on him. Great evasion for spot removal)As you can see. Artifacts provide tremendous support so I've got a good deal of recursion with Myr Retriever, Junk Diver and also Goblin Welder to get them back into play.You'll notice that every creature in this list except for two, Purphoros and Soul of New Phyrexia, have a power equal to 3 or less. That way, you have much less of a chance of "whiffing". On the other side, Soul of New Phyrexia is fantastic in the graveyard to protect my creatures from board-wipes. Purphoros is a creature while he's in the graveyard, so he can be returned to the battlefield with Balthor or Chainer's ability, or with Phyrexian Delver. Or if someone casts Open the Vaults, or Living Death. Win-cons:Mostly Purphoros, sometimes Gray Merchant, but I can also win with beatdown if necessary, or even a combination of Deathbringer Thoctar, Blood Artist, Ashnod's Altar and Grenzo. Basically, if I have a live Grenzo coupled with a Purphoros on the board (which happens regularly due to the fetching described in the next paragraph), it's pretty much a done deal. Especially when cards like Siege-Gang Commander, Emrakul's Hatcher, or Sengir Autocrat enter the battlefield. Tel-Jilad Stylus also puts in work with these kinda cards. I'm usually doing an average of 14-28 damage per turn to all opponents with this combo that comes together very frequently.I'm not sure if anyone here is familiar with Fleshwrither and I can't believe it's not a much more utilized card in EDH. It can effectively fetch any creature card with CMC 4 in your library. So, my go-to's are Purphoros, Crypt Ghast, or Balthor the Defiled (situational, perfect after a board-wipe). You can also copy him with Kiki, and sacrifice his copy to get more value out of his ability and use it multiple times. He is a true workhorse in this deck and is absolutely bonkers.Just to talk about only playing 31 lands. I have found this to be the right number of lands. We play in a group where we do partial mulligans and my strategy is to mull away most creatures and to mainly keep lands, artifacts, tutors and Braid of Fire. I will keep a hand that is all land without a doubt. I really only need 3 to start off, and then will usually draw or scry into more throughout the game. This deck is incredibly resilient and requires a lot of playtime to develop the right strategy. I learned that I can't always come right out and play Grenzo on turn 3. If he gets removed, I have to wait until turn 5 to recast him (unless I have Urza's Incubator), but the point is - to take it slow and develop the board with utility artifacts, or Cabal/Urborg. Since you can activate Grenzo at instant speed - I always wait until the last moment to use him. If nobody has attacked me or cast any spells, I'll activate him at the end step before my turn comes back around. Or if someone does target me, or attack me, I'll activate for the chance to get a buff blocker like Fledgling Dragon (with threshold), or Dakmor Lancer to destroy the threat. Or, Furystoke Giant and then turn my creatures sideways. The deck just amazes me more and more every time I play it, which is now exclusively. Seems like the only real weakness is Trick Bind (wait 'til next turn) and Grafdiggers Cage/Pithing Needle/Nevermore, but you can play around all of them. I feel like there's so much more to talk about, and I don't know if anyone else has ever built a deck like this one. I have thought about going to power 4, but I just don't like the idea of having to cast him with 2 counters, just gets pricey, but I may consider it over time just for fun. I spent a long time researching the cards to put into this deck and I feel like I've made it my own and very unique version, but I'm open to suggestions.I highly recommend trying this deck out, and though this isn't a budget version of the deck (it's maxed out), I'm quite sure it can still be very potent even after swapping out expensive cards for decent similar cards. It's the most fun I've ever had playing EDH.Cards I'm considering adding:DuplicantPhyrexian AltarCanal DredgerMana GeyserSpinerock KnollThoughts?PS: Hopefully that card bot comes on here and puts links in, a lot of these cards are just not commonly used and probably unknown - like Fleshwrither.
2rvtnt	-12304	1420829817	EDH	Question about Alesha, Who Smiles at Death.	"When" she attacks; that is a triggered ability which should be able to be copied by [[Strionic Resonator]] costing six total mana to put out two creatures. It's confusing because it's a triggered ability, and then you pay 2, which seems like you're activating. My question is, can you use [[Rings of Brighthearth]] to copy that activation, or is it not an activation at all?
2szsz9	-12304	1421712627	magicTCG	Banned list question, and then a Pod deck question.	How often can WotC update the banned list? I thought it was only once per year - but can they make revisions? Kinda weak how they took 3 cards from Modern and only gave one back.I'm an EDH guy, but I've kept my (100% foil) Melira-Pod deck around in case people want to play Modern. I'm probably just going to keep it put together, even if it takes years for Pod to become unbanned in Modern again simply because I barely play the format and it's just too fun and unique of a deck to dismantle it!Just curious, how will Pod look without the Pod, just value Junk w/ 4 Chords?I will definitely be brewing with GGT, how about you guys?
2t76ib	-12304	1421866853	magicTCG	Why not limiting copies instead of banning?	In Vintage, certain cards are limited - meaning you can only run one copy. Why can't they do this in other formats like Modern, Legacy, and Standard? Has this been discussed before?It would keep a lot of people happy (I'm a Pod player), and also lower the consistency level of these top-tier decks. In addition, it would free up slots for more variation. They could also possibly revise the banned list and allow other cards to be limited, like Stoneforge and JTMS. Any thoughts?

I am open to using a keyboard/mouse again if I hear it's beneficial.How's the transition from console to PC for souls games, do you still use a controller, or do you use mouse/keyboard?How substantial is the graphical differences between console and PC? Are there any patches or downloads I need in addition to buying the games on Steam?Thanks for any help!
2ut4lw	-12304	1423091398	fnv	New to PC, questions about modding.	Just got a gaming PC recently and have had my first experience with modding on Dark Souls: Prepare to Die edition. I replaced the textures with that of a much higher quality, uncapped the frame-rate (to 60!), made it full-screen, etc.. I want to note that it was relatively easy to do this, only took a few hours. I'm a huge fan of the Soul series so I was stoked to see how much better it looked/performed on PC compared to the years I spent on the console slaying demons.My other favorite game series happens to be Fallout. So I'm thinking about getting NV. I wanted to ask a couple of questions before I buy the game and get in deep. I mostly want to know how much better it can look than console, and if it's worth buying for the PC; if mods make the quality of gaming that much better.Obviously Fallout was released for PC and wasn't a port, unlike Dark Souls.. so that being said, is modding necessary, or can you make it look much better just by cranking up the graphics to max? Also, how is the performance vs console? Console crashed at least a few times per session, has that all been fixed up in the PC versions? What have been the most popular mods, and what impacts have they had for the players? Lastly, is there an efficient guide for beginners to optimize performance/graphics with mods without much time requirement? I'd rather spend more time playing!Here are my specs in case there are restrictions:3.6ghz i78gb DDR3120gb SSDGeForce GTX750 TiThanks in advance!
2v48nw	-12304	1423337392	onebros	Starting SL1 run for the first time..	Pyromancer, SL1.So my first stop was to buy firebombs from the merchant in the Undead Burg so that I can farm the ghosts in New Londo Ruins for the Jagged Ghost Blade. I've consumed all the humanity I have (3) and have killed like 70 of these dudes and they have only been dropping the Transient Curses. Is the drop rate super low, or am I just super unlucky? Is there anything else I can do to improve the drop rate this so early in the game? I've literally done nothing but light the bonfire in the Burg, buy the firebombs, and kill ghosts.Also, I noticed that there are two Ghost Blades. On an SL1 character, I am supposed to be going for the Jagged one, right, because it has bleed?Any other advice for early game preparations?
2vkq5n	-12304	1423687577	darksouls	Question about shield upgrades.	I'm doing an SL1 run and have the Grass Crest Shield. I wanted to know what happens when it's upgraded? I tried going on the wiki, but it's so vague and I can't see the stat upgrades. Can you actually give resistance to lightning or fire? If you do get resistance, do you also get weakness to opposing elements?I am in Anor Londo and have reached the blacksmith, so I have access to lightning upgrades.Thanks!
2vtg1w	-12304	1423868835	onebros	First time Fighting Hall and Oates aka Shenk and Tittle aka Harold and Maude.. Best known as O&amp;S!!	To be clear: I'm here to vent, not to ask for a brojob with this guys. I will do this one solo. And I wanted to talk about how much skill these guys help you develop at SL1.My build is Lightning Reinforced Club +3 two-handed (r1 mostly), with a Grass Crest Shield on my back. No armor. Using Havel's/Blue Tearstone because I think that's the best I've got at the moment, no RTSR yet. No pyromancy. I'm on PC using a PS3 controller.So last night I started my first attempt to beat these gents at SL1. I spent about 3 hours running from the bonfire, half-way up the spiral staircase to do a 180 and jump over the railing, then to proceed down the hallway and run past the guardians to approach the fog.. over and over again. It takes about 45 seconds to get from bonfire to fog. Half of the time in the beginning I didn't even get a hit in on this duo because Harold would slide at me and knock me down to no health while Maude(fatty) would hit me with a charging hammer right as I was getting back up. But, then I started learning to dodge that slide attack by rolling to the right. And then, I started being able to position Harold behind Maude so that I can get a hit in after a butt-slam or a missed overhead attack. Near the end of my session I had found myself with enough skill to knock Maude out of the picture to go against Super Harold. I was finally learning his moveset and being able to dodge, getting a couple good hits in but then I just needed some.. sleep. I'm hoping to go round 2 tonight and will post results when I down these bastards. I do feel like I'm ready. At first it seemed impossible, but I stayed the path and now I feel like their days are numbered.. I'm wondering if this is the hardest boss to solo in Dark Souls NG without summoning help from NPCs? I'm sure there are many of people who were once in my shoes, any words of encouragement in my final hour?*EDIT* Lightning Reinforced Club
2w48dt	-12304	1424121091	darksouls	Is there a way to summon more than one person at a time in Dark Souls?	I recently saw a video on youtube of a guy who had two of his friends playing with him and was using some sort of mod. When I tried to look up the mod, it seemed as though it was through the Games For Windows Live, which now is obsolete and we just use Steam as a launcher with that new beta thing they did.Is there a working mod that allows you to summon more than one person, and can it actually be people you know?
2wwdj7	-12304	1424718269	darksouls	Summoning/Co-Op. Could someone break this down for me like I'm a five year-old?	I've been playing for many years, but the online aspects of it have always been secondary - I would summon every once in awhile to down a tough boss like Flamelurker (I know, Demon's Souls, but that's how infrequently I summon lol). Now, I'm considering trying to play with more people in Dark Souls, but I have no idea how it works.I've seen people post their screen names and what platform they play on like it's just that simple. Where do you add someone, and then, how do you join games with them for Co-Op? Is it random, or are you guaranteed to play with that person?I am playing on PC, through Steam. I have an SL1 character that I do not wish to do co-op with, and then I have a level 30 something that I'd be happy to get Jolly with.
2x4w6s	-12304	1424887745	onebros	The lords have fallen. Time for blind DLC.	Bed of Chaos - No cheese, did die a few times.Gravelord Nito - Had to leave and upgrade a Divine weapon before I could even get close. Then downed him in a few tries after.Seeth the Scaleless - RTSR, easy.4 Kings - Tanked with Havels/estus. LRC+5 2-handed.The lords are dead - no summons/no cheese/no pyromancy - door to the Kiln is open. I'm assuming you have to do the DLC before Gwyn? I've never played the DLC before, but just started it blind and took out the first boss relatively easily.. but I feel that grief is imminent. Any spoiler free advice that I should know so I don't miss anything important? Also, is (Oolacile) the only DLC in Dark Souls?

That would be interesting to see.
2yphe4	-12304	1426100267	onebros	90 hours, my OneBro journey. *possible spoilers*	Though I don't have access to imgur, I do have a picture of Gwyn's soul on my phone, but I wanted more to share my experience through this amazing journey to becoming a OneBro. I'm on PC running DsFix and the HD Textures pack, running at 59fps, and using a PS3 controller.A few points:No Summons. Though I did come close.. There were times of dire need and desperation where I searched for a summon sign and would have used it if there were one placed, but there never was one available. I even made a post asking for a bro on Kalameet, but I ended up beating him on my own.All bosses and DLC completed. The DLC was the hardest part of Dark Souls. Even though Kalameet took me less hours than O&amp;S, I feel that O&amp;S gave me the skill to overcome the bosses in the DLC and saved me some hours. Kalameet was the most difficult boss.I used the following items regularly on this run:Red Tear Stone Ring - The best ring. Get this and the Grass Crest Shield as soon as you can.Havel's Ring - Keep a fast roll, at any cost.Chloranthy Ring - Didn't get this until the near the end of the game. Apparently, I never knew about the Great Hollow or Ash Lake, and I've had this game since release. Great ring though.Dark Wood Grain RingBellowing Dragoncrest Ring - Very helpful when trying to one-shot something with Power Within and RTSR.Lightning Reinforced Club +5 - Tried beating to a pulp, it worked, this weapon is fantastic once you get used to the moveset. Strong attack owns.Jagged Ghostblade - Was relatively useless after O&amp;S, but was extremely powerful for the first half of the game and highly recommended to anyone considering trying to be a OneBro.Light Crossbow +15 - A life saver, it's how I beat Kalameet and will be explained.Pyromancy +5 fully ascendedFire Tempest, Great Combustion, Power Within killed a fair share the bosses.Grass Crest Shield +15 - Usually on the back.Balder Shield +15 - The stability got me through the DLC.Dingy set +9 or +10 (some pieces) Upgrades very nicely.Gold-Hemmed set (great for the first half of the game)**Never received Crown of Dusk. I killed Dusk after Manus because I thought it WAS Manus on the ground and didn't know what to do. Doh!Notable difficult boss fights and my strategies:Ornstein &amp; Smough:This fight took me the most hours to master, about 15.. Yep, really. The strategy I used was to kill Ornstein first with Jagged Ghost Blade, which isn't easy. Then I took out Super Smough with the Lightning Reinforced Club + 5, which was very easy. It took me a very long time to beat them because I tried everything - using different weapon combos, or beating Smough first, but could never beat Super Ornstein - I never tried Pyromancy, because it wasn't heavily upgraded at that time. This fight taught me how to be a true warrior, and paved the path for the rest of the game.Four Kings:Tanked with Havels armor, Grass Crest Shield +15 on back, swung 2H Lit ReClub+5 and chugged estus when needed - didn't take many tries, about an hour. People say this strategy only works on New Game, not + games.Gravelord Nito:Thought he would be worth mentioning. I had a lot of trouble because of the respawning skeletons, forcing me to leave and upgrade a Divine weapon. Once they were dead for good, I switched back to the Lit ReClub +5. Stay close and let loose until he starts charging for his AOE attack, run for the hills and then repeat. Fell quickly after using this strategy.Knight Artorias:Good grief this guy is tough. I ended up taking him out with RTSR, Power Within, and Fire Tempest and then finished with melee. It was a very difficult fight and it was hard to get Fire Tempest to go off without getting hit, but if you did, it took off about 70% of his health, leaving you only with a few more hits to put him down. Took awhile to get it right.Manus:I'm least proud about this, but I just couldn't beat him straight-up. I found the way to cheese him with the Light Crossbow +15 and Hawks Ring/Heavy Bolts from behind the fog. It was very difficult to aim your body to the right point in which to actually hit him, so difficult I almost gave up completely and then tried to melee again but I got lucky and found the sweet spot right when I was about to give up. I felt terrible after I did it and wished I had beat him fairly. I could only get him to about half his health depleted, and didn't have (or know about) the Silver Pendant, so I was in deep. I don't recommend cheesing him, it feels awful.Kalameet:This son of a bitch.. Someone here on reddit mentioned that O&amp;S are Kalameets play-toys. They were right. This is definitely the toughest boss I've fought in Dark Souls. I tried many different things such as a one-shot with Fire Tempest, Power Within, and RTSR/Bellowing, but I didn't have the Crown of Dusk and it was very difficult to hit him with all three frames of Fire Tempest, usually only frames would hit and then I was dead when he jumped up to spit fire at the ground (large AOE). So yea, that didn't work.. I tried just straight up melee 2H Lit ReClub+5 / RTSR, but I would always eventually get hit with something half-way through. So last thing I tried was the Light Crossbow +15 / RTSR. And here's the strategy I developed, and I'm not sure that anyone else has done this:Preparation:Kill the first 2 dogs and then let the last dog hit you once. The dogs attack seems to have 2 levels of damage. The lesser damage is bad, so heal and let him hit to again. The attack should take you down to half your HP. This is important. Have the RSTR and Light Crossbow +15 equipped. Walk through the fog and then proceed to fall to the first ledge (not the one with water pouring over it, it's slightly to the left of that). You should take some fall damage which is good. Then drop down to the left ledge, then to the right. Now, there's another ledge on your right, but don't fall on that one - just roll off to the ground and take your last bit of fall damage that will put you in RTSR range like clockwork every fight. Now the fight begins. Run to the right side wall and hug it until you see Kalameet and lock on. If you're lucky, he'll stick to the right side of the wall and breathe fire straight at you multiple times, but it will hit the debris/shrubs sticking out of the wall in front of you, while your bolts will go through doing roughly 230 damage per hit. You can get him down to a very low amount of health before he finally moves enough to the left that you have to run. I got him down to 2 hits left with the crossbow more than once and then he finally hit me and killed me, it was brutal. But, I ended up finishing him a few tries later.Lastly.. Gwyn:I'm not great at parrying - but on my 2nd or 3rd try I was able to parry the first attack and two others, getting him down to one hit left, but he hit me with a fast attack and I died. Then, after that I wasn't able to parry the first jumping attack from him so I changed up my strategy and used RTSR / Great Combustion. I would lock on, and dodge his first jumping attack and then hit once and roll far away. I would try to keep my distance pretty far, but still able to lock on, and bait a jumping attack. Also, every time I dodged a grab, I would always have time for another hit and then roll away again. Rinse and repeat, it wasn't that bad. Just have a fast roll and keep your distance. There's less than 2 weeks left until Bloodborne and I'm so stoked, I just don't know what to do with my time until then.. I own Dark Souls 2 on PS3, but I'm waiting to get it on PC for SotFS and all the DLC (which I haven't played yet - I hear it's awesome). So, I'm not sure if I'm going to go through NG+ or start another OneBro New Game, because of things I missed like being a DarkWraith and the Crown of Dusk - maybe start again and try Co-Op? Any recommendations?Anyways. I hope this helps anyone who is considering doing a OneBro or is stuck on any of the bosses above. It feels great to have completed this journey!
2ywosa	-12304	1426253330	darksouls	Can summons do damage to an aggro'd NPC?	Yesterday I started another SL1 character and was hanging out in front of the Undead Church waiting for summon signs for jolly cooperation, which showed up shortly..As we were going through the church, I ended up getting to the room where Lautrec is locked up and I remembered what that bastard does if you let him loose so I decided to kill him. I had a Jagged Ghost Blade +2 and the Grass Crest Shield that wasn't upgraded, still very much a new game. So he killed me instead, but while I was fighting him my summoned help was swinging as well and I couldn't tell if he was doing any damage. I came back and was able to kill him with Firebombs and keeping my distance and finally got him to say "you despicable..." felt good, that bastard. Then I later realized that I couldn't get the Dingy set, bummer!Can anyone confirm damage to aggro'd NPCs from summoned help
2z1e2r	-12304	1426355439	darksouls	Boss Colosseum?	This has probably been posted before as an idea, but how cool would it be if every boss you defeat is exiled to a Colosseum where you can revisit and battle over and over again?I imagine this would be part of the main menu "Colosseum" and you would see a list of bosses you've slain. Choose "Manus" and then you are warped through the fissure, and appear right in front of the fog gate to Manus' lair. I would like to fight Manus again, since I cheesed him so bad on my SL1 play-through.. I owe him a fair fight! Which boss would you be most stoked to be able to play over and over again?

Today I found out they didn't get enough orders to support a MR and so I'll have to come back tomorrow morning at 10am to pick up my copy. I've called about 5 other stores in my area, and another 2 out of state to see if they are doing a MR. The only 2 that said yes are completely sold out of the CE.

Then, after some progression.. something happened. It seems now that it's eternally moonlit. Brilliant, right?Without any spoilers, can someone let me know if we'll ever see that fiery sky again before NG+? I don't want to know HOW, just that it will exist again. Or.. if it's too much of a spoiler, say nothing. I've gone in completely blind so far and can continue to tough it out.Many thanks.
30lm68	-12304	1427552128	bloodborne	Pretty far in the game (I think!) and still no..	So I've beaten 5-6 bosses already and I still haven't found the items needed to do the Chalice Dungeons. I refuse to look it up (or anything for that matter) because I have been going through completely blind and searching piece of landscape thoroughly. To give everyone a frame of where I'm at in the game without spoiling for others, I'm fighting a boss with the initials "O R" in an large 'unseen' area. I'd just like to know if I've already passed the area in which to receive the items necessary to access the dungeons. If so, please let me know which area (not specific location) I should explore more thoroughly and I'll get to it. If I'm not there yet, just tell me to keep on keepin' on.The reason why I'm posting this is because it feels like I'm pretty 'late game' and there's a lot of tension and desolation built up at this point and it's weird to me to have seen those dungeon stones in the Hunter's Dream since the beginning and not be able to interact with them after this much progression in the game. I will feel silly if I already have the means to do it, but didn't know it.Thank you.EDIT: Thanks for the replies and pointing me in the right direction. Also, not sure why people downvote this. It's a legitimate question structured to not spoil things for others. Blind discovery is what I covet in new souls titles and I respect and want the same for others.. This subreddit so far doesn't have the warmth of the other souls sections.

When exactly is it?I would also love tips on where to buy this stuff on line (as I live in Canada). Is that even possible?

I'd really appriciate any info! Thanks!

13eu9v	-12305	1353270370	photography	Real estate photographers - I have  a question about creating virtual tours.	Hey Guys,I have recently expanded my photography business into architectural photography and am marketing my services to local realtors. I am looking to start offering virtual tours as part of my package, and am looking at different software options for creating them. I have worked for two different virtual tour companies before however both of them did all their own stitching, ect. Therefore I have all the equipment/knowledge required to make the images, and no clue how to build the tour itself. When I try to search for tutorials almost all of the ones I find are sponsored by certain software companies and therefore are bias towards their product - So I am turning to good old Reddit. Is there an industry standard? What do you use? Any and all opinions/advice would be greatly appreciated! I currently work in CS6 and LR4 (though im petty sure LR wont be relevant). here is my equipment list (if it's helpful)I shoot Nikon (either full frame or crop) use a Sigma 8mm lensuse a nodel ninja pano head. Thank you so much for your time! All the best and happy shooting!

14x6xs	-12305	1355622625	drupal	Question about slideshows.	Hey guys,I am a complete idiot when it comes to maintaining my website, which was built for me with Drupal. I have a slideshow on my home page that is awesome, however has a few problems that are really annoying.The name of the slideshow used is "Galleria". The problem I am having with it is, for one,  am only able to upload images one at a time. It is a photography website so I am constantly updating it and it takes forever to do it this way - I was wondering if there was a way of changing it so I could upload multiple images at once. The other issue is that it automatically displays errors that then stay on the screen. The error that comes up most often is "this image took more than 30 seconds to load" (which I get because my wifi is brutal), however it's very annoying when a few of those stack up and I would like people with slower connections to be able to visit my site and not have to see those. I am hoping to find a way to disable them from coming up automatically...I know it's far fetched asking you guys such specific questions but the guy who built it for me is a close friend and already had done sucha  good job with everything - i hate to keep bothering him with these problems, and I'd be stoked if it turned out to be a problem I could fix myself.Thanks so much for your time!   
150x6j	-12305	1355792748	VictoriaBC	Found: white Iphone 4 in the parking lot of Commonwealth pool	Hey guys, I found a white iphone (looks like a 4) in the parking lot at commonwealth pool today (dec 17th). I took it home, charged it and tried to call "home" but whoever owns it had already disabled it. I have called commonwealth pool and given them my number so if you would like to call them and ask for it they should give it to you so you can call me. If they refuse to give you my number for whatever reason then PM and we can go about things that way. I am scared of returning it to the wrong person only to have it jail broken so please be prepared to describe the home screen image. I am debating taking it to the police but I think that would probably decrease the chances of its owner tracking you down so I am going to hang on to it for a while longer and hope to hear from you. cheers!

18v71h	-12305	1361333345	analog	ELI5 question re: Light leak on only some images. 	This is probably a really dumb question, but one of my favorite 35mm bodies produces light leak, however it's only on SOME of the images.This seems odd to me because its always the same leak in the same spot (a big bright strip down the image) - yet it only happens about 30% of the time. How does this work?? My only theory is that it only happens when I shoot wide open at F2.8, which would explain why it only happens in some photos - I cant really confirm that just by looking at the my shots though and am not a fan of running a test based on such a loose theory - what are your thoughts on it?it probably wont help but just in case it - the body this is happening on is a contax RTS, and the lens i have on it is a 35mm carlziess 2.8

I need to make changes in it, however am totally lost. I would be thrilled if someone could give me a 15 minute crash coarse on the user interface. Nothing too in depth - just the basics.To give an example -  I have a gallery and know how to upload images to it ect, however would REALLY benefit from being able to upload multiple files at once. I downloaded a module that appears to be for that purpose, and know where to go to "enable" it, but that's all - and I can't otherwise find any trace of the module anywhere, nore do i know how to get it to work with my existing gallery (if thats even possible.)I'm aware tyhis is probably a lot more complicated than i'm anticipating it to bem but i figured it was worth asking. Any web work ive had to do in the past was very simple to understand but drupal seems so confusing - i just want to know the VERY basic functions so I can at least keep my website up to date,Ideally i could meet with one of you over skype and share screens for a few minutes, but text works too. EDIT:Hey guys! sorry I bailed on this post - the morning after I made it my son was born and the computer has been off limits since, haha. I really appreciate your responses and tips/offers. I will be following up for sure and am so excited there are people willing to try and help. Thanks again!

Anyone bought something like this? I doubt the "actual value" is accurate but I don't care too much about that. SO long as the actual value is more than 2g i'd be happy to be honest. I also don't like that I can't see the business that is putting on this deal... how concerned should I be about that? It also said there a re 10 bought but I'm positive that counter is easy to rig. Let me know if you think this is a awful idea, or if you think it might be a risk worth taking. I've yet to have a bad groupon experience but I know they do exists from time to time.

30ci0r	-12305	1427351178	strobist	So I want to light someone in a specific way at night, however do it during a long exposure. Who know's a thing or two about lighting subjects at night?	As a wedding photographer I always jump at filling my off season with unique, and fun jobs that push my creativity, and expand my skill set. One of the gigs I have lined up for later this month however, is for the poster of a play that will be touring north america this year. From what I understand It's a "space comedy", and they requested I shoot the one model with "flash gordon" style lighting. My first thought was to tackle the lighting in my studio and then go out to a remote location with rocky, jupiter esq terrain, and get a nice long exposure of the starry sky. I'd then make a composite of the two. Then I got thinking - and I decided this would be WAY more fun if I did the whole thing on location. It will also really challenge me as aside from the usual "back lit cell phone trail" wedding photos - I have a big weak spot when it comes to lighting someone in the pitch black. I always struggle with separating them properly from the background (or "black"ground I should say). My minimal attepts at doing this in the past have usually been with a cross lighting set up, with an umbrella at 45 degrees to one side of them, and a bare speedlight lighting the opposite side of them from behind (I find the "total rim light" a little cheesy). This has only ever produced satisfactory results thought, and I want to kill this shoot. So first and foremost - do any of you have any tips on how I can light someone "flash gordon style", with no ambient light present? the alien B's (1500s) I have will likely be too powerful right? If so, I will be limited to two speedlights, and of coarse a cell phone LED (which I have a feeling might be handy here). As far as modifiers go, I have umbrellas, a mini beauty dish, and honey comb grids/bounce card. I use Pocket Wizard Plus 3's.My Idea is two cheek lights from each side/back (with the speedlights), and then using my cell phone as a key fill... would I be able to do that and still have a tack sharp image? or will the 'cell phone painting' show too much motion? I imagine I would "blink" the cell phone light from above the subjects face by uncovering and then recovering it really quickly. Next - just looking for tips on lighting a model during a long exposure... ive never really done it before... Thanks so much you guys! I look forward to hearing what you suggest. Sorry for the long post, lol

38hbgu	-12305	1433395242	trees	I have smoked trees for the majority of my 28 years on earth, however can NOT roll a proper joint. Not even close. I'm swallowing my pride and turning to r/trees for help.	I've tried to learn on multiple occasions. I've watched youtube tutorials, tried to get my buddies to show me, and even had a "rolling machine" bought for me by an ex girlfriend that I STILL struggled with. It's frustrating because - while a good ol' bowl does hit the spot more often then not - Sometimes a Joint is just what the doctor ordered.I don't know if I'm a lost cause or not but I figured the best way to find out if theres any hope at all is to ask Reddit. Does anyone have any tricks? The part I struggle with is the rolling. my fingers just cant pull it off. It takes me forever to get an "even spread" of bud across the paper (which frustrates me enough as it it), and then when the time comes to roll, it all falls apart. If ever I do miraculously manage to roll it, its WAY too loose. Help.EDIT:Before any of you guys point it out - I just noticed the hilarious relevance of my user name. To avoid that becoming the subject of the thread - it has nothing to do with Weed. It's a reference to 120 roll film (analog photography). lol

I honestly can't get enough of it. A lot of people moan about it, yet, they have still pumped 300 hours into it, sure it has faults, what game doesn't? I think destiny should have been made in a similar manor to WoW, a massive game at release, maybe the size of the two upcoming DLC's and with a bit more content as far as talent tree's, gear, planets, character customisation, story line and maybe crafting of some sorts, the game is already brilliant, but with a lot more they could have maybe had a subscription fee to justify the size, and then build and expand, as WoW has. I don't want a destiny two, I don't want to do this all again in a few years, I want the same game, with a F*uck load more. I'm not a fan of subscriptions and I know a lot of people aren't, but let's face it, it would have been EPICEdit: Grammar

2tekaf	-12356	1422022510	Accounting	[Need some advice] Accounting for my Laundromat	Hi everyone,I own a cash only unattended Laundromat and have been keeping the books up on Excel.  I just bought QuickBooks Pro 2015 and am in the process of moving all the files over.Here is my issue:  I have been pulling all the quarters out of the washers and dryers and placing those quarters back in the change machines.  Then I would take the bills out of the change machines and deposit them into my bank account and use those deposit slips as the profits for the Laundromat.Well, sometimes I need to refill the change machines with quarters from the bank because people will come in with a $20 bill and leave with those quarters without doing any laundry.At times I have just turned the cash in the change machines back into quarters and other times I would withdraw quarters out of the bank account to reload the change machines (but I use the bank deposits as profit shown) and I think this is messing up my book keeping.I'm having a difficult time wrapping my head around this.  Is there an easier way I can be doing the book keeping?

1sg24q	-12398	1386569700	TagPro	[Suggestion] New Game-type	I doubt that I'm the first one to come up with this idea, but I was thinking about a potential new game type that I would like to see. The objective of this game-type would be to locate the flag and maintain possession of it for the longest period of time possible. I really think this would be a lot of fun, resulting in tons of awesome jukes!Does anyone foresee potential issues with such a game-type? Has this been mentioned before? I'm new to this sub-reddit, but I've been playing TagPro off and on for a few weeks.

I ran WinMTR and it's showing packet loss anywhere from 5-30 on almost every node. I live in a college dorm if that makes a difference. Google Chrome has also been acting up a bit outside of TagPro. Sometimes web pages will not load at all, or very slowly.Thanks in advance-phrix

I'm going to Bunbury with some friends and I'm super excited, however this will be my first music festival and I would appreciate any advice.

33ivpg	-12398	1429739292	PacificCrestTrail	The PCT in July	My friend and I have 30 days to hike in July. We're very interested in hiking a section of the PCT, but we've hit a couple roadblocks during our planning.What are some ideal sections to hike in July? Many people seem to recommend the John Muir Trail for this time of the year, but we're having trouble getting permits for that trail. Is there another section that would be ideal if we're unable to get permits which grant us access to the JMT?Thanks in advance.

Tickets are a little over $300 right now on Stubhub, but I've heard they can go for as low as $100 each when it gets closer to the date. Anyway, **what are my chances of being able to get tickets if I keep waiting?** Thanks in advance for any helpful replies. Bonnaroo is the biggest thing I have planned for this summer, so I really don't wanna miss out.

3crryz	-12398	1436509991	TagProIRL	Squid's Top Tracks	After checking out /u/corbett656's awesome playlists, I felt the need to share some of the stuff I've been listening to lately. I have a real passion for music and enjoy giving people new stuff to listen to. I hope some of you guys take the time to listen to this stuff and give me feedback! Enjoy1.[London Grammar - Hey Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQcj4A_DlbA)London Grammar's lead singer has incredible control over her voice, and this track shows that off very nicely. This is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. After hearing the band perform this track live in the KEXP studio, Cheryl Waters said, "Wow. That song's very powerful on record, but sitting here in the room hearing that.. I'm a little taken aback."2.[Bobby Nourmand - B E C A U S E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvQuKlgV7NE)An interesting take on The Beatles classic song "Because", Bobby Nourmand really delivers with this one. I just discovered this song recently and I've been so addicted to it. I'm confident that a lot of you guys would love this.3.[Shakey Graves - Roll the Bones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD72LbIk02M)This guy is super talented. "Shakey Graves sings, plays guitar, kicks a tambourine all the while keeping beat with his home-made kick drum suitcase." Do not sleep on Shakey Graves! Damn he's good.4.[Papadosio - Find Your Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XubLXDkOL7M)Love the intro on this song. Good stuff!5.[Ark Patrol - Tokyo (Subranger Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOVFBpZMLR0)Here's a chill electronic song to please your ears. Definitely pairs well with TagPro.6.[Houndmouth - For No One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtBZ8OlU7nY)Pretty chill acoustic track. Give it a shot.7.[POP ETC - Running In Circles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqEdRk-SuOM)Released in January of this year, this fun pop song sounds like it's straight from the 80s. 8.[The Cranberries - Electric Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhMmba1BTxc)The Cranberries are pretty well-known, but have you heard this track? Dolores O'Riordan once again proves to be one of the best female vocalists I've heard. 9.[The Greens - Something In The Water (Oliver Nelson Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vYOokbED2w)I'm not much of a dancer, but this track never fails to make me wanna shake it. Throw this on at a party when everyone's feeling buzzed and you might have a dance party.10.[Mac DeMarco - Still Together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=34&amp;v=z3lasr1R8zk)This last one might be hit or miss, but I personally love it. Mac's personality is a lot of fun to see. It's easy to tell that he's having fun performing. Shoutout to the guitarist on the epic The Smiths-esque solo. Fuck yeah.
3g60sf	-12398	1438977422	travel	Vacation with dad	Hello, /r/travel! Please excuse me if this isn't the right place to post, but my father and I have two weeks to go on vacation and I was hoping you could point me in the right direction. I'm graduating from college soon and this could be the last chance I have to take a trip with my father. I checked the side-bar and read some of the FAQs, but couldn't find anything that really seemed helpful. I'm sure I could do a Google search and find somewhere to go, but I'm a big fan of the personal perspective that the Reddit community has to offer.Here's a little context to base any suggestions on: * We will be coming from Ohio  * We want to avoid big cities for the most part  * We're interested in scenic drives, mountains, waterfalls, hiking, rivers, etc.  * We would like to stay within the United States. * Our budget is around $1,500 USD.** Sleeping Bear Dunes in Michigan looks promising, but we've never been to Michigan. Does anyone have experience there? We have enjoyed previous trips to Colorado, [Ohiopyle in Pennsylvania](http://wilderness-voyageurs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Sugar-Run-2000x1200.jpg), [the Smoky Mountains in TN](http://www.mypigeonforge.com/uploadedImages/What_To_Do/great-smoky-mountains.jpg) and [Hocking Hills here in Ohio](http://bourbonridgeretreat.com/wp-content/gallery/old-mans-cave/upper-falls-hocking-hills.jpg).

Otherwise - let's get on with it...**Hey everyone, thanks for giving this post a peek! I'm bringing you another playlist to check out. This playlist is incredibly electic, with a clear emphasis on chilled/downtempo songs ranging from liquid dubstep to funeral doom to classic rock and even piano-heavy tracks.

[n u a g e s - Gone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz8Ib8PbU3U)  Very downtempo. Borderline too slow to be enjoyable, but great nonetheless.   6. [Neil Young - Down By The River](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6PsBm4VeJQ)  A classic, for sure.   7. [Adam Gyorgy - Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H99FM6S8rU)   Nothing short of an incredible piano piece. Hold onto your butts!   8.

'Nuff said.  12. [Béla Fleck &amp; Abigail Washburn - And Am I Born to Die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGgmXqJIGY0)  Although banjo isn't for everyone, I urge you to give this song a chance. These are two of the best banjo players in the world. You just might like this little ditty. 13. [Vienna Teng - The Hymn Of Acxiom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ttTf8N7Bwg)   A beautiful and haunting hymn with cryptic lyrics about 'internet surveillance' in this modern world of ours.  14.

cwta9	-12404	1280839059	dwarffortress	Magma and Volcano on same map?	I've been trying for 3 hours now to get a volcano, a river, at least a few trees and flux stone on the one map. Everytime I'm successful in these parameters I see the river but theres no volcano in embark. This is really frustrating, I was sure its possible but this gives me doubt, if anyone has a map like this or a worldgen setting that gets squares like this I'd love it.

I don't really want to start until a new version comes out and since it hasn't been updated since March, I'm guessing there will be a dwarven caravan full of changes (ha-ha..). I don't particularly play or like adventure mode and I find it difficult to find what is predicted for the next version using dev tracker or the blog apart from vampires and stuff, so I was wondering if you could help me by answering two questions:When is the next version estimated?What will be in the next version?

I played Wildstar during the beta and liked it, but I didn't like the dungeons (they seemed without direction) and the way AoE healing worked in them (I only ever played healers in WoW). It seemed very tedious and annoying to try to heal people. Can someone tell me about the state of the game, as now I have some free time and I am considering purchasing the game.EDIT: does anyone have a trial code I can use? Much appreciated.

I was looking at starting with the $500 cookie cutter pc, and then adding on a monitor and keyboard (already have a mouse for it, which I am using with my laptop).  Are there any recommendations for those two, or any other slight improvements I could make to the cookie cutter and still fit within my budget?  Fans, better GPU, etc.Thanks!

1chnsj	-12417	1366149791	buildapcforme	Workstation build, going for cheap/small	Hey guys, this should be a semi-interesting request.  I'm trying to put together a computer for a very specific project, and I figured I'd come ask you guys over here, since you've helped me build a damn good computer before. &gt;What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using.Going to be a workstation, primarily MATLAB.  Not going to be graphics intensive, nor will it need things like internet connectivity. &gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?Preferred budget is as low as possible.  I've thought about trying the Raspberry Pi, but from what I've look into that'd be a bit slow when handling MATLAB. &gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)It can wait.  I'm not planning to put it together soon. &gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? "Everything" is not specific enough. Just the tower? Operating System? Keyboard, mouse, monitor, speakers/headset, WiFi adapter, etc?Just the tower.  Hell, maybe not even the case.  If there's a decent cheap micro-case maybe, but otherwise that could be custom built.  Important things are hardware specs, such as PSU, motherboard, chip, storage.  &gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?USA.  I'm not near a Microcenter though. &gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.N/A&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line?N/A&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.Nothing specific.  Just needs to have like 2 USB 2.0 ports.  &gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS? Is it 32bit or 64bit?Yes.  &gt;Extra info:The whole idea is that I'm trying to design something that's strong enough to run MATLAB, but only just.  Going for the smallest and cheapest parts I can find.  I've taken a look over at the logical increments guide in /r/buildapc, but that seems so much more focused on gaming than anything else.  
1g6k8i	-12417	1371019954	buildapcforme	Small desktop to replace parents' ancient one	&gt;What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. This'll be mostly for just web browsing, storing pictures and the like.  Basically a $300 facebook machine, but my parents have struggled with bad laptops and a non-working desktop for too long. &gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?I'd like to keep it between $300 and $400 at max.  &gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)Hopefully in the next week or so.  Want it in the weeks after Father's day.&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? "Everything" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.Tower, CPU, motherboard, Power supply, optical drive, RAM, storage.  Already have mouse, keyboard, monitor, and I doubt they'll be needing a GPU.  &gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?US, not near Microcenter.&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?Nope, no OS.  I'd like to get them Windows 7, as they have one laptop with Windows 8 and hate it.

2cx9c7	-12417	1407448202	malehairadvice	Been way too long since a decent haircut or shave. Looking for suggestions on something much more professional.	Hey guys!  As said in the title, I've been out of it for quite a while now, to the point where I'm almost embarrassed to be seen in public by how bad my hair/facial hair look.  The beard I can probably fix up with a decent hair trimmer, but the hair is a bit more complicated.  I currently don't do use any product or anything outside of shampoo/conditioner (which is probably pretty obvious).  I would like to keep my hair long if at all possible, with main inspiration coming from Jared Leto [1](http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSkUXk9v0Dlt57_z5wGMfpT6EhrNYtPSYK683buETPj7gaIMkPx) [2](http://assets-s3.usmagazine.com/uploads/assets/articles/70862-jared-letos-longtime-stylist-dishes-on-his-oscars-hair/1393435976_jared-leto-hair-467.jpg) , but I'm not exactly sure that would be something appropriate in a business setting.  I've considering chopping basically all of it off and going for a simple layered cut or an undercut of sorts, but that's a decision I wouldn't want to make without first getting advice on the matter.  Also, one of the big problems for me tends to be that I have both thick hair and a relatively-low forehead.  My hair tends to fall forward across my face, and it can take a lot for it to stay in place.  I used to try and fix that by getting my hair thinned when I went to the barber, but rarely did that change anything for long.  But yes, any advice would be greatly appreciated on what I should do.    Easy is preferable, but I'm open to any and all comments. EDIT:  Damnit, I made this a self post on accident.  Imgur album for my hair is [here](http://imgur.com/a/7kaNz#0)

371uo3	-12430	1432433125	AustralianPolitics	Innovative Political Party launching based on economics and game-theory, not policy. Inaugural meetup June 2 in the Sydney CBD. Introducing the Neutral Voting Bloc!	Hi All,I've been working on an amazing idea recently and am trying to get 550 members together (AEC requirement) to create the political party to go with it.The party is called the [Neutral Voting Bloc](http://nvbloc.org) and it uses game theory to attract preferences in the senate. I've done lots of simulations and with [just 1% of the primary vote](https://i.imgur.com/XunPmgc.png) there is a good chance of winning 1 senate seat per state (nearly 85% chance in NSW).The [inaugural meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Sydney-Neutral-Voting-Bloc-Open-Meetup/) is June 2nd in Sydney's CBD so if this idea interests you and you're close by I encourage you to come along. There I'll be talking about exactly how and why it works, and what we can expect from it over its life. I'll also record the talk and put it online afterwards.Put plainly, this party has the potential to radically alter the face of Australian politics forever, and for the better. An interesting consequence of the game-theory involved (which mirrors economic theory) is that the system of democracy used *inside* the NVB must out-compete the system *outside* (IE our current parliament). Thus the NVB can only be used to introduce *exclusively better* forms of democracy. This is because it relies on parties being self-interested, just like economics relies on somewhat rational actors. The only parties to be at a disadvantage are the Big L's.Would love to see you at the meetup,Max

Hi BitcoinAus,For those who don't know I've been a long time member of the Bitcoin Sydney community and helped establish the Meetups with Jason all those moons ago. I'm also a Bitcoin expert, and have had my hands in Bitcoin code for over four years.I'm launching a political party and I need your help. This isn't a political party like any other, and the blockchain plays a crucial role. The game theory is somewhat complex, but suffice it to say it has amazing potential, such that it could easily win [5 of the 38](https://i.imgur.com/XunPmgc.png) senate seats up for grabs in the next federal election with just 1% of the primary vote.If you're interested and would like to know more the website is [http://nvbloc.org](http://nvbloc.org) -- the name of the party is the Neutral Voting Bloc.The [inaugural meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Sydney-Neutral-Voting-Bloc-Open-Meetup/) will be held at the Metropolitan Hotel on the 2nd of June where I'll explain exactly how and why this thing is going to work and revolutionize Australian politics, I would love it if you'd come along and consider becoming a founding member.Cheers,Max

3cs3kf	-12430	1436519668	australia	Australia's Two-Party System Has Failed Us, and We Can't "Just Fix It", Is There a Way?	A few days ago a [Junkee article][1] by a similar title was [posted to /r/Australia][2], and although the author's heart was in the right place, the 'solution' to just replace bad politicians with good independent politicians is no solution at all. However, there is still hope, as I shall explain.Here's the crux of my argument: replacing party-politicians with independent-politicians will not work well. Without infrastructure to prevent re-party-fication and factionalization there is no reason to believe that independents can provide a long term solution, or will avoid joining new or existing parties, or that they will be any more effective than current representatives. Ignoring the lack of Gilmore's plan working en mass anywhere else in the world, the problem lies with a common obsession in democracies: "who should rule?" It is a toxic question that leads to faulty reasoning. It is epistemologically analogous to "who is the authoritative source of knowledge?" There is no authoritative source of knowledge, and likewise, there are no permanently good rulers. There is an additional problem with existing explanations of why democracy works: just as the philosophy of empiricism thought that somehow the laws of nature were 'written' on to the mind through observation, some proponents of democracy think that the right rulers are somehow 'read' from the minds of voters. But voters are not a magic eight ball, they are just as fallible as politicians, and perfectly capable of making the same mistakes. Without accepting this fallibility how can we design a democratic system that is immune? If we fight with reality we will not be able to keep from fooling ourselves.We can see the who-should-rule question embedded all over the place:&gt; If all the people that vote Liberal for no other reason than they don't like Labor, and [vice versa], all voted for Greens and independents instead the problem would solve itself. &gt; But that requires voters give more thought to their vote than "A or B". - /u/Kangalooney (top comment on the original thread)Imagine if we re-framed this for knowledge: "If everyone who doesn't like Oracle-1 and Oracle-2 went to Oracle-3 or Oracle-N we'd be okay". Of course, we could argue that some sort of market for correctness would be set up between the oracles but this is inconsistent with them *being* oracles. Likewise, expecting competition to prompt parties to somehow create good policy ignores the fact that **the origin of good policy must therefore not be the parties**.(Also of note is that Kangalooney criticizes the voters, particularly swing voters, not representatives or the system.)Or from Jane Gilmore, the author of the original article: &gt; What if every rural seat in the country sent someone to parliament who was prepared to actually fight for the things that matter to rural communities? What if the country people elected MPs who were strongly invested in rural medical facilities, ... [many more examples] ... infrastructure and education?Unfortunately, electing a benevolent dictator is not really a solution. Essentially, that is the fictional entity Gilmore imagines, and often what we all imagine, but it is a simplistic and flawed vision. The who-should-rule question has no good answer, especially for communities of our size. There are just too many ideas, people, interests, and motives for one independent to represent them all fairly. It doesn't matter how much someone *wants* to do good things, that in no way *enables* them to. Without an explanation of *why* results should improve we should not expect them to.There are also a number of *traditional* political problems Gilmore's solution doesn't solve. For example, minor parties have never been good at working together: factions, ideology, dogma, these are what are expressed when you put minor parties in a room. It's not a magic recipe for success, and we've known that for a long time.Furthermore, when you do get 'cooperation' in diverse coalition governments, a curious phenomenon occurs around the *creation* of policy. Party A suggests Policy A, which they think solves a problem. Party B suggest Policy B which they think will solve the same problem. After negotiations the resultant policy (AB) is a 'compromise' or mish-mash of the two, and curiously *nobody thought AB would work in the first place!* The solution is not just *more* proportional representation, we need to go deeper.If our existing electoral system had the answer within it all along, then it would in itself be the solution to the problems we've had, the same problems that were created by that very system! We need *new* strategy, we need *new* systems of organization, we need *new* ways to rally minor parties to help them cooperate instead of bickering. We need something that has *never been tried before* because everything that has been tried has failed (else we wouldn't be in the state we are!)[Karl Popper had a useful criterion][3] for determining the quality of a democratic government. First, a democracy is one in which bad policy can be removed without violence. Tick. Second, `the quality of a democracy is *how well* it can remove bad policy. (1)` Uhhh, we're probably about a 'D+' on that one. I challenge anyone to think of a better method of ranking democracies with such an objective and explicable quality.I will construct a truism:`The optimum political strategy is not to implement good policy and remove bad policy. (2)`We know this because:1. Current political strategies that work do not resemble (2)2. People who try (2) face overwhelming odds and rarely succeed beyond the small scaleWithout addressing (2) how can we expect the policy we produce to improve? If we don't change how vulnerable our representatives are to removal, why should we expect any greater control than we have now? In short, to achieve anything resembling (2) requires change to both how power is structured and instantiated in people, furthermore, such a change cannot be obsessed with 'who should rule'.I'll follow now in Gilmore's footsteps, and give you a few paragraphs of 'what ifs', of the requirements, the potential, the promises, and the hardships. Everything from here out can be started tomorrow, if we put the work in.What if a small proportion of Australians realised we have to step into the unknown? That to solve these problems we must embrace and move past them, and to do so has never been done before; that it will be scary, and difficult -- for becoming pioneers has never been easy -- that we must abandon our previous ideas about *why* democracy is good, and look beyond ideology into a scalable future?What if Australia had an unique entry point for new ideas, a way to experiment, boldly and safely, with out risking our political system? What if our Senate elections involved parties trading preferences so we could introduce elements to [help reorganise our political landscape without permanently altering our parliament][6]? What if we could craft a new political party just to house an experiment, an experiment that could *give more* back to minor parties, allowing them to specialize, and in doing so give each their ability to really help in the areas they know most about? What if this party used their elected candidates only as a proxy, and allowed novel experiments to feed into our real parliament? [What if this party could have a candidate elected in every state with only 1% of the primary vote?][4]What if this political party could house a direct democracy, and allow all voters to participate whenever they felt it necessary? What if leaders were held to account throughout their term, and in the cases they needed removing, what if we could remove them? What if we embrace bold new voting systems, allowing rules and division of power based on issues? What if you could set a delegate like a family member, or friend, or community leader, instead of having to vote all the time? What if this happened through every level of our political system, so that power structures could be quickly rearranged without needing the whole population to vote? What if we could somehow introduce [liquid democracy][5], to ensure that voting can be *fast and cheap*? What if we used modern cryptography to ensure anonymity, cost effectiveness, and immutable and transparent ballots?What if this party was [already in motion][5] and on the way to gaining 550 members so it can register Federally and run for the next election? What if this party had a [solid plan of action][7] and the explanations to back it up? What if your actions today help decide the future of our parliament, and the future of Australia? What if you had the chance to [join this party][]? What if you could be part of the 1% to take back democracy?I am trying to start a political party to directly address the philosophical issues I explore through this post. It is called the [Neutral Voting Bloc][8], requires ~1% of the primary vote to win 6 Senate seats, and it is novel in strategy, implementation, and philosophy.The Neutral Voting Bloc is the only solution I know of, which is why I'm building it. Join me?**TL;DR** I'm starting a political party to address some major epistemological issues with canonical democracy, which just so happen to coincide with two terrible major parties.[1]: http://junkee.com/australias-two-party-system-has-failed-us-heres-how-we-can-fix-it/60812[2]: https://np.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/3cjfxx/australias_twoparty_system_has_failed_us_heres/[3]: http://www.iep.utm.edu/popp-pol/#SH2a[4]: http://xk.io/2015/03/27/The-Senate-Preference-Hack/[5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg0_Vhldz-8[6]: http://xk.io/2015/03/06/first-attempt-to-describe-the-neutral-voting-bloc/[7]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFGcYqizzU[8]: http://nvbloc.org
3f5ezh	-12430	1438256983	Bitcoin	How to Decentralize Bitcoin Development Forever -- but You Might Not Like It	## IntroductionDevelopment of Bitcoin has become dysfunctional. This post isn't about either side of the block size debate, though the debate itself is the inspiration for this post. While the correct course of action may not be apparent, the divide in the community (and corresponding lack of direction) is apparent.Despite this, some of the community seems stead fast in finding a solution and moving forward in particular directions against the advice of some core developers. Unfortunately, we currently lack the ability to determine who truly has the most support in the public debate, or even if it is one sided. Herein I propose a way to:* Fund core development, and* Determine the source code used for compilation in a decentralized mannerAll of this occurs on-blockchain where needed, and there are no trusted entities besides the compiler-maintainers, which can again be chosen in a similar decentralized manner. In the future perhaps we can use zero knowledge proofs to decentralize the compiling stage, but for the moment this is not considered.This proposal requires bitcoins to be *burnt*, or destroyed, in order to form consensus. While this may be unpalatable for some, it provides a way to secure the distributed consensus.## IngredientsThere are four key parts to this proposal:* Bitcoin* Git* [GitTorrent][2] - decentralized git hosting* [BlocVoting][4] - delegative democracy on the blockchainI presume the reader is familiar with the first two: Bitcoin and Git. Bitcoin provides the blockchain and Git provides our method of managing source code.[GitTorrent][2] is a recent development that allows accessing and hosting source code via a DHT, similar to accessing torrents via magnet links.[BlocVoting][4] is a protocol of my own design that facilitates [liquid democracy][5] (or [delegative democracy][1]) on the blockchain.## The Burn-GraphBitcoin offers us an important lesson: the irreversible conversion or destruction of resources provides a method for converging to consensus in a distributed manner. By burning coins in a way that resembles proof-of-work we can secure a blockchain like structure to manage identities.Coins are burnt by sending them to an OP_RETURN output that contains linking information, among other things, and makes it impossible for these coins to be spent. Each burn transaction points to one or two previous burn transactions, which in turn points to previous burn transactions, etc. In this way, starting from a genesis burn tx, a graph (or list) of burnings can form. Like the blockchain has a "top block", the burn-graph will have one node with more coins *cumulatively* burnt than any other. This is the head of the graph, and used as the basis of the weighting system. In this way, an identity's weighting is determined by the volume of resources destroyed (number of coins). Because a weighting will only be obtained (for the burner) if the burning ends inside the burn-graph, there is an incentive to work off the top, in the same way that Bitcoin incentivises mining on top of the Bitcoin chain.&gt; Aside: exponentially increasing the weighting with respect to time may be required in order to ensure old burnings don't interfere with recent burnings.After the burn-graph is established we can extract a map (or dictionary, or list of (key, value) pairs) that will continually be updated. This map is between an identity (which can be a Bitcoin address) and a weighting. One increases their weighting by burning more coins.## Membership and VotingUsing this map as a membership list (open to anyone willing to participate in the burn-graph) we can then allocate the number of votes for that identity based on the weighting. Votes could be used to indicated current preference for the *hash* of the *git commit* which they prefer as the *canonical* source used for Bitcoin compilation. One option would be to implement direct democracy on the blockchain, but that would be inefficient.Instead, I propose an implementation of [Delegative Democracy][1]. This would allow most individuals (who do not have the technical prowess needed to read and understand Bitcoin source code) to choose a delegate, which they can change at any time, who can vote on their behalf. This delegate may in turn have a delegate of their own. This allows core developers to hold the same responsibility and power as they have in the past, until they are unable to solve problems effectively amongst themselves. This inevitably happens from time to time, and so at this point the next layer of delegates can take matters into their own hands and vote directly. If this increase in participation is still unable to solve the issue, the process can continue until we reach something similar to direct democracy where *everyone* is participating.Furthermore, when there is little controversy within the community delegative democracy is incredibly light, perhaps requiring only a few kilobytes per release cycle. During times of controversy it is natural that participation will rise, and so the space requirements will rise accordingly.&gt; Disclosure: I am developing an on-blockchain implementation of delegative democracy called [BlocVoting][4].This voting network would not physically transfer tokens as some voting proposals do. Rather a weighted graph of voters would be established and evaluated for each ballot.## Hosting Source CodeWhile (at this stage) we *could* hook up a git server to read the blockchain and publish information about the current git head, we can do better.Using [GitTorrent][2] ([source code][3]) we can decentralize the source-code-hosting problem. Because we can decide on the latest commit with respect to the blockchain we no longer need to reference a) a hosted git repository, or b) a central authority. (These are the only two methods originally suggested, though the author does talk about using blockchain name resolution.) In this case, running a node to store and provide access to the Bitcoin source code would help the source-code-serving network (especially a node that tries to include as many branches as possible).The final problem to solve is source code distribution. The same voting network is capable of voting on compiler-maintainers. These would be public key identities (probably well connected to real world identities) that would be responsible for deterministically compiling and hosting Bitcoin binaries, based on what the most recent ballot yielded as the git head. In this way we could at least know if any funny business was going on by comparing the various compiled binaries. There is the potential to decentralize this further, but for the moment the above is considered sufficient.## Funding Core DevelopmentAt the beginning I mentioned funding core development, though that has remained absent until now. There is no way that I know of to integrate this sort of funding in such a way that does not provide an advantage for an attacker. However, with sensible defaults we can heavily mitigate this possibility.One possibility is for the protocol to mandate each vote requires 2 outputs with some ratio between the values (such as 1:1). One is an OP_RETURN output, and one standard output. By *default* users would be encouraged to select a core developer to donate to, though they could specify any address (including their own) to direct the second output at. Whether to include this at all is a design decision perhaps best left for later, but the possibility of funding development is tantalizing.## SummaryUsing some novel technology and the immutability of the blockchain we can construct a framework to help manage decisions around what code to include in Bitcoin, including hard-forks and block-size updates. The unique combination of these technologies allows for a completely decentralized development process without the implicit trust that the Bitcoin community has endured (and now suffers from). We can host code trustlessly using GitTorrent and publish our preference for which code to use as *the* Bitcoin source code. Using a proof-of-burn based weighted graph we can ensure we maintain decentralized consensus using similar game theory to Bitcoin itself.See also: [Original on my blog](http://xk.io/2015/07/23/decentralize-bitcoin-development-forever/), [github](https://github.com/xk-io/xk-io.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/2015-07-24-decentralize-bitcoin-development-forever.md)## Main Criticisms* Too decentralized* Not decentralized enough* The letters "democracy" appear (if the word democracy is an issue for you, since in this case it is used only to label voting systems, please read it as "weighted preference graph")* Buying votes is undemocratic* This proposal would implode and take bitcoin with it (at which point I'd like to remind everyone that I'm not proposing ditching what we have now, this is in no way a destructive proposal -- if we were to implement it and then it broke there is still GitHub and exactly what we have now).[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy[2]: http://blog.printf.net/articles/2015/05/29/announcing-gittorrent-a-decentralized-github/[3]: https://github.com/cjb/GitTorrent[4]: https://github.com/xertrov/blocvoting[5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg0_Vhldz-8
3gs2pl	-12430	1439418899	Bitcoin	A Question to Those Who Are in Favour of 1 MB Blocks: Why Is 1,000,000 Bytes Optimum? I've Never Heard an Answer to This Question.	I have an explanation for why 1,000,000 bytes was chosen originally: it was 'far enough away' and 'human enough such that we can talk about it easily'. But that's not what I'm talking about.What I don't have an explanation for is why 1,000,000 bytes is optimum. Surely, if this is based on an economic explanation there should be a calculable part. I don't know what the relevant variables would be (hdd space growth, average bandwidth of global internet users, median fee, etc).Surely, if the explanation for why we should have 1 MB blocks is good it should be specific in regards to what the actual size of blocks should be. If the explanation is also good for 10 KB blocks or 100 MB blocks then it's a bit useless.I'm particularly looking for explanations that *aren't* going to work for much smaller or much larger blocks (an order of magnitude in each direction), though being out by a factor of 3 is probably okay (so an explanation for 400 KB - 3 MB blocks would be good, but not 100 KB).For us to keep 1 MB blocks I think we definitely need an explanation as to why it's better.NB: I usually sit on the increase-the-blocksize side of the debate, but I don't know if I'm right. Without understanding all the explanations I can't know if I'm right or not.

3inqj2	-12430	1440716925	bitcoinxt	As much as I like Bitcoin XT; the 75% supermajority is a major problem. (Because F2Pool)	Let me preface this by saying I am a supporter of Bitcoin XT and even run a [node sponsoring / hosting service](http://nodeup.xk.io) that has *nearly 90 active full XT nodes* on the network. I want XT to succeed, and is why I think 75% is too low for a supermajority; it makes us vulnerable.Some of you might have seen [this article on BIP101 flaws](http://organofcorti.blogspot.com.au/2015/08/bip101-implementation-flaws.html) and one point sticks out:&gt; It is almost certain that if BIP101 is activated, it will be with a sub-supermajority, or even a minority. Now, it's not almost certain, but in particular circumstances it is a game killing issue. Take the following:1. Two large mining pools could collude to have &gt;= 25% voting power. (F2Pool, BTCChina, and Bitfury hold around 21.7%, 14.1%, 11.2% of voting power respectively).* They are all currently voting for BIP100 and so collusion candidates represent at *least* 47% of all voting power.* That means potential damage to the BIP101 camp is salient somewhere between 25% and 50% miner support (call it 45% to get rid of the race condition). * If the BIP101 movement were within the 25-45% range and the above three pools started mining on `Not Bitcoin XT`, then all BIP101 miners (25-45%) will eventually start producing big blocks which would not be accepted into the main chain (because they're only supported by 25-45%). * Since (in this case) Non-BIP101 miners would make up &gt;55% of the hashing power it is incredibly unlikely the BIP101 chain would last long - there would be many stale blocks and it would cost BIP101 miners dearly, until they moved back to Core.What this means comes back to a generic truth about self-organised systems: minority rule never works.By selecting 75% as the supermajority threshold we give a wide window of opportunity to a minority to fuck it up for everyone else. IMO this is exactly what we want to avoid, whether that's in regards to core devs, mining support, or w/e. A 95% supermajority would close that window and restrict it to a much larger actor and a much smaller time frame, greatly decreasing the risk of an attack. The only 'perfect' solution is unanimous support but for obvious reasons that is unlikely.The next question is something like 'can we even get 95% support?' which is a difficult one to answer. Another option is 85% because that would mean the two largest BIP100 supporters listed above would need to collude, or all three.

1ku3s6	-12435	1377125301	offmychest	I witnessed an accident and I don't really have anyone to talk to	Hey off my chest , long time reader first time submitter, ( always wanted to use that joke)I watched an old lady get hit by a bus yesterday. She was running across the road, she clearly shouldn't have been, the bus rounded the corner and smashed into her.Luckily it wasn't going too fast, she wasn't killed on impact, there was no severe visible damage , and while she ended up under the bus, a mixture of bus height and her size meant that there was plenty of clearance so she wasn't trapped.Now I was one of the nearest witnesses, and as soon as I saw the bus was safely stopped I ran across to help, I could see she wasn't in immediate danger, and other had reached her at the same time so I pulled out the phone and called the ambulance , relayed instructions as best I could to the people who were tending to her, checked on the driver reassured him that it wasn't his fault ( he genuinely reacted as fast as he could given the situation, and the fact he was driving correctly meant he hit her at a safer speed than some drivers I've seen in the city)I provided witness statements to the police and the bus companies incident manager who had made it to the scene.Then as she was put in the ambulance and the police and sorts finished their initial statements, that was it, I walked off.The reason I'm sharing this is I'm still a little unsettled by it, I saw her vividily hit the front of the bus, heard her scream,heard the impact, listened to her moan and cry as I called the ambulance. Saw the nasty cut on her arm ( the most visual damage which looked nasty but not as bad as it could be)I also keep thinking should I have done more, should I have run after her, tried to pull her back ? I mean she was a few feet away out of arms reach, I know if I ran out i'd have been hit too, but still, should I have tried?And also I don't know how to find out if she's OK, we didn't hear her name,there was no incident number or contact given to us by the police for updates, and I imagine I'll only be contacted if this has to go to court.But mostly the reason I'm posting this is I have no one to talk to about it, I live with my parents currently, they are away on holiday, I'm single, my friends all have bigger worries to deal with, and I don't like to burden them with my issues unless its serious (I suffer from that desire to be seen as the strong dependable one, not one with vulnerabilities, but that's another story)I don't wanna post about it on FB or something because that would seem too much like attention seeking ( i suppose this does too, but I'm trading off on the anonymous nature of reedit for this, I don't really get the attention, I just get to unburden)I had a quick chat with an old friend over the phone last night about it but I quickly left the subject because I felt immediately bad for burdening her.I  also know, I'm fine I'm unharmed why should I be looking for attention I'm not the one who was hit ya know?I guess what I want is a hug and someone to hear me tell this story , tell me I did the right thing and just give me that re Assurance . Any way that's it, I'm freaked out a touch, I'm OK I'm settling, i just felt pretty isolated and wanted to talk to someone.

1nd4dk	-12435	1380442659	SquaredCircle	30 matches in 30 days day 14 , AJ Styles vs Paul London vs Low Ki , Ring of honor first anniversary show, febuary 8th 2003	http://m.kiwi.kz/watch/rl8sb9x5c69o/pages/1/ads/0/scroll/0Set the scene :ROH launched in 2002 and quickly gained a cult following showcasing the cream of the indie crop to small but enthusiastic audiences and in ita first year attracted such global stars as super crazy and eddie gurrero.After being called one of ROH'S "founding fathers" low ki captured rhe ROH title in a grueling 60 minute iron man match becoming the very first world champ for ROH.However a few months later xavier who had up untill this point been your typical mid card baby face challenged for the title. During this match it was revealed he had alligned him self with the fallen angel Christopher Daniels to form the prophecy stable and cheated to steal the title from low ki, who as you can imagine. Wanted it back.Paul london had debuted for ROH in 2002 and swiftly became a fan favorite and home grown hero to the ROH fan base for his innovative offense , never quit intensity and lack of self preservation. The latter of which inspiring the signature " please dont die" chants synomous with paul's matchs. He won a shot at the title the previous decemeber which he had lost. And naturally wanted another crack at it.AJ Styles had made a name for him self wrestling at NWA Wild side and made a splash in ROH by becoming the first winner of the number one contenders trophy and battling low ki for his title. Being a huge fan favorite and one of ROH'S biggest stars AJ was not far from the title picture .So here we are feburary 8th in queens new york ( the first time philly based ROH hosts a show in new york I believe) all 3 men have legitimate claims to a title shot. All 3 men loved by the ROH faithful.  So who gets a shot. They all get a shot at each other. A triple threat match the winner gets to challenge Xavier later that night for the ROH title.The match is incredible. And while in some cases could be called a spot fest . My word what spots. Each on entertaining. Many unique and all of them seem fair. Making each man look skilled powerful and a credible combatant. No man runs through the others. No man is booked to squash.  At any point any man can win and you can never expect the out come.The aftermathWhen the bell rings Xavier ( who has been at ring side the whole time) get into the ring and tells the winner that if he wants the shot he fights now or not at all. So with no chance to rest. No time to prepare after the grueling triple threat. The winner agrees and battles Xavier in a drawn out brutal affair which is worth checking out.Of course all 3 men went on to bigger things. AJ becoming one of TNAs flag ship stars. Low ki working for many big names including WWE TNA and in japan.And paul london went to WWE and after seeing how great he was in ROH never seemed to be utilised correctly. Why is this important to me.This match has some strong nostalgic connontations with me. It represents the days in the mid 2000's where I had got back into wrestling as a teenager. Watching WWE replays on sky tv. Enjoying everything I could. And picking a favorite wrestler at the time. Paul london. I couldn't explain why but the plucky cruiserweight just clicked with me and I always felt he should do more. At the same time I got broadband internet and began to learn more about the business. This lead me to finding my local indy fed and for one long summer I joined the fed as a trainee and ring announcer (including an amazing training session with bryan danielson)Expressing my desire to watch more indy wrestling one of the trainers said he loan me some tapes. Luckily he happend to live a few streets from me and handed me a stack of dvds and tapes. Included in this stack was joe vs punk 2. A full taped copy of the 2004 ted petty invitational.  And finally the ROH first aniversary show.  These all blew my mind and when this match came up i got to see paul london being the star I knew he could be battling some of the biggest names in the indies and it was great.So this match means a lot becuase it helped me see how good my favorite could be. But more importantly it takes me back to a time where I turned my interest of wrestling into a love of wrestling.  Where I learned there was more than WWE and a summer where I made memories that will last a life time.

And thanks to the excellent worki find here I was able to pick up some knowledge on the down low so I knew what she was talking about, or send her some cool pics as inspiration/ conversation starters. This sub helped me engage better with something she loved.Any way, Christmas is just around the corner and when discussing gifts ( this will be our first Christmas together) she mentioned she'd love a better storage solution for her polishes and her gear ( for her birthday she got a lot of tools and accessories from her sister)I joked with her that I'd get her a tool box like I use for my model painting , she said that'd be fine as its better than her current system. Her current system I hasten to add is a back of polishes, and tools  in the box they were shipped in.So I thought I'd come to you guys see what you use. Preferably I'm looking for a total solution, maybe a case which holds lots of polish and has compartments for tools perhaps. She really wouldn't mind the tool box I imagine but if I can find a better idea from you fine folk that would be ideal.Thanks in advance for any help you can give me

2wbbz9	-12440	1424270562	GlobalOffensive	Missing Donation Money from #GO4BALKAN Charity Drive?	aswd
2wf2ow	-12440	1424342968	GlobalOffensive	Pita and GO4Charity donations - Part2	**The first text is in here: http://bit.ly/1A68it0**I am digging some more on this case. Actually, took 1 week vacation from my job to focus all of my work on this. I also booked a flight and I’m going to Bosnia in several days (http://i.imgur.com/9BJMaND.jpg). Meanwhile, I've found out which house will be presented to us, with a cs:go logo as a “proof”, as built with the money from CS:GO community. **Infact, that house is being built with money from Bosnian citizens and, a large amount, from the donation made by Intesa SaoPaolo Bank in BiH.** I’ve found an article on Bosnian press about this when the donation was made. You’ll see that the house built from our donations match with the ones which were presented in the article about Intesa SaoPaolo donation, regardless of the cs logo on the house :). Also, the organization said already that they just received the money, but they changed that statement into “we actually got them in august”. I’ve also spent many hours to listen all the radio shows of this organization since August 20 2014 til September 20 2014. Not a single word about CS:GO, GO4Balkan or counter-strike. Which is quite strange since they say thanks to all of the big donators on their Facebook, twitter, radio shows, TV shows (all are produced by the organization). And Pita’s donation is twice bigger than the one made by the bank. For example (http://otvorenamreza.ba/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/54663185-e464-4b9b-b7cc-798a57e60ff4-otvorenamrezadonacija-preview-640x330.jpg). 19.000 KM means 19.000 BAM which is rougly 8.500 euros.So, as I was saying, I booked a flight for Bosnia. I am going there to prove my theory, which is:Pita got scared when I asked him about the money on February 12 so he contacted this organization.Meanwhile, through Intesa SaoPaolo from Romania I got a contact from the bank in Bosnia. I've sent an e-mail and I am waiting for a reply. I can't tell you why yet.**Note:** I will finish my text about the taxes payed for moving the money after this charity. Because of the poor management, over 400 Euros were lost during this process.

He accused one of the guys who had the money for not answering his calls for a month. I will convert the interview now and post it here.And, by the way, organization said loud and clear the house with cs:go logo pita posted was made 4 months ago, as i said. I will upload the video now. GL&amp;HF Pita.

He even owns a company. Yet, he didn't used it and a lot of money were spent on taxes and fees for moving money from one Paypal account to another.- Found out why the money were at some point in Holland**HeatoN's involvement in GO4Balkan Charity**I think you all know by now the Pitagate, which it was presented [here](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2wbhjx/article_about_pita_and_the_money_from_go4balkan/) and [here](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2wkapq/updates_on_pita_charity_scandal_from_hltv_credits/).From Pita's [statement](http://i.imgur.com/xy4qN7I.jpg), [the interview with](vimeo.com/1201592490 Ena Jazic from the bosnian organization who received the donation, and from the [photo provided by Fifflaren](http://i.imgur.com/uS6iI31.png), we have a clearer picture now: **HeatoN held the main account in which the money from the charity went. He was the one who failed to deliver Pita the money for the donation to be made in August 2014. The very same month, Faruk Pita was** [hired by NiP](http://www.hltv.org/news/12994-nip-add-pita-as-a-strategy-adviser). In October 9 2014, HeatoN's company, which should've have at least 10.000 euros, was filed for bankruptcy. **One strong question remains(!): Why Pita never mentioned that HeatoN is one of the ones who is holding the money?** [Here](http://i.imgur.com/uS6iI31.png)**The Steelseries Giveaway problem**It's a known fact that Steelseries made a Giveaway to support the donations for GO4Balkan (all the info's can be found [here](http://www.hltv.org/go4balkan/) and also the list of the winners).Some also might know that it takes about a month to receive something purchased from Steelseries. Yet, more than two months after the Charity was over and the winners were announced, no one received anything. Because of the people who were asking questions, Pita made a [statement](http://i.imgur.com/1jesBqg.jpg). You may find some similarities with the statement made right after the charity, like &gt; I will keep you informed. Also, check out the comments [too](http://i.imgur.com/CwDlbAG.jpg). **I know from a source, which contacted me today, that Pita failed to send the list of the winners to Steelseries for five months. He sent that list at the end of September  2014, but it was edited a bit. I am still waiting for an official response from Steelseries, but I've only contacted them today. Anyway, some of the items were shipped in November 2014. I will follow up this one and I hope to get a chance to compare the first list of the winners with the one Pita sent.***EDIT:* E-mail from Steelseries to one of the winners - http://i.imgur.com/si0CRYj.png*EDIT:* **Steelseris replied:** https://twitter.com/SteelSeries/status/569771585009266688?cn=cmVwbHk%3D**Pita knows how charities work**I've found out today that it's not the first time Pita was in contact with the charity world and with non-profit organization. Moreover, he claims to be a financial advisor at a bank from Sweden. Yet, with this Charity, he managed to waste more than 500 euros on taxes and fees. [He even owns a company](http://i.imgur.com/wl7ojWR.jpg). **So he could've easily avoid many fees by using the account attached to that company, but he did not. Also, I've created an account on the website used to raise the money (gofoundme) and I've found out that from the first step they teach you how to avoid paying much on taxes. Paypal was the last recommendation and the most "expensive" one. Pita chose to use more than one Paypal account.****Why the money were in Holland?**After I made an account on gofoundme, I've started a charity to see how things work. Remember that the lady from the bosnian organization said that the money were received [in Holland](http://i.imgur.com/Bew7o6R.jpg). Since there I've been asking myself why, but I think the answer is on the gofoundme website. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/TVZeuld.jpg)*I will come back tomorrow with an article about how Hltv.org tried to help Pita cover up the mess, but they gave up - for now, at least. Hopefully, by then I will have a reply from Steelseries*

2x3meh	-12440	1424861407	GlobalOffensive	Pita Forged Papers for his Defence	**HeatoN's first reaction**: &gt; Frankly i had no idea about this untill a few days ago, i never had access to that account and the only one who had As far as i know is "Fiskoo" As mentioned by @OnFireAnders on HLTV. The whole situation is really sad and I hope from the buttom on my heart that it will be solved. As for a statement from NiP it will be hard, since we have No idea whats going on, but we are closely looking in to getting all the details.Source: HeatoN's Twitter*Update made in the night:*In his statement published by Hltv, Faruk "pita" Pita claims:&gt; It was impossible for us to send the money to Otvorena Mreza's paypal, so they gave us the option to wire it to their account in the Netherlands. That is why we had to go through an account in the Netherlands. Otvorena Mreza decided that they would cover the fees included in that transfer, something its PR manager explained to the troll calling her.Yet, one hour later he published, on his twitter, [a photo from which](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B-pZLy5VIAAsWtw.jpg:large) we can conclude that the organization had PayPal. So what's the account in Netherlands then? They can't open PayPal in Bosnia? Some can confirm?................................................................................................................................................Pita, in collaboration with Hltv, released a statement last night, on February 24, with a six days delay, according to his sayings. [here](http://www.hltv.org/news/14324-pita-comments-on-go4balkan-money)I will assume many of you have all the details about this case. So, first of all, Pita said nothing new in that Statement. Moreover, he admitted his lie about the amount raised, which he said it was 25.000 euros and now he reckons it's 25.323 euros + 1.600 dollars. He also admitted that roughly 10.000 euros are not donated by now and he says that the money are well kept in the account provided by HeatoN's company. Well, that company is bankrupt since October 9 2014 and President of the company (HeatoN) and the Director (Fiskoo - ex NiP manager) resigned from the company on September 23, 2014. To be clear: those money are lost!He also now said that Anders never had the money, even if he stated two times that Anders has the money. I won't go too much in this, you all know his statements.Moving forward, Pita presented some documents. Well, it took about 20 minutes to be proved they are forged. The guy who destroyed Pita's papers is  dyOnisos, from eXitfrag.com. Let's see what he discovered at this [document](https://www.dropbox.com/s/byxc2wtnpa04l4f/Scan1-1.pdf?dl=0):**eXitfrag.com - dyOnisos quoted bellow**&gt; I am gonna call it a fake tbh after examining the pdf file a bit more i think the 2 last payments are doctored and the name is also doctored in on all 3 payments. http://imgur.com/0JY2xri&gt; 1.Copy text in document2.paste text in a noteblok or whatever3.compare copied text and pdf,wonder how some are lost?4.download document open in photoshop (it really likes pdf files and the good thing is that pdf files directly imported to PS are vector which scales with no problem)5.choose a high rez like 4800*67886.zoom to the missing copied text (spoiler its the last 2 payments)7.look on that doctored picture. http://i.imgur.com/0JY2xri.png&gt; Looking into the meta with a forensic tool, one can see the creation date of the main file and also modified date, i just wanna say that i think Pita has been busy the 24-02-2015 11:51:05.Here's a link: http://imgur.com/l4OblaQ**Also, the math is wrong in this forged document. The final amount in the document is 16.214,52 euros. But, 7960 + 7960 + 293,52 = 16.213,52****UPDATE AGAIN!**Thanks to the guys who were commenting this, there is a proof he forged the paypal document aswell.*joaonl:* &gt; Well the transaction screenshot is edited also https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B-pZLy5VIAAsWtw.jpg:large&gt; After quick looking with PS. You can see that the NOT edited text is not aligned in the same line with the description. This is indeed correct, in my own paypal account it is not aligned. But wait, there ARE aligned lines. DAFUQ?&gt; The font used by the note is also thinner than the font used on the rest of the document. DAFUQ?&gt; Pro tip, if you want to forge documents, use 1 source so that the document doesnt lose the quality. Even snipping tool in Windows 7+ is 94% raw quality.&gt; There is something fishy going on here.*under_cover_lover:* &gt; "Transfered" is also spelled incorrectly.*Notice that in the first document provided by Pita via Hltv.org there are three transactions. In the second document, there is only one. Also, in the first document, the owner, Rusmir Hadzic, is sending the money away, he's not receiving them.*More over, quoted from pita statement: &gt; **This account belongs to Stockholm E-sport Productions AB and it’s still running today** without me having any access to it whatsoever.No, mate, it's not running today. E-Sport Production went bankrupt [October 9, 2014](http://www.solidinfo.se/foretag/stockholm-e-sport-productions-ab/personer). Also notice, by pressing "Historik", that HeatoN and Fiskoo resigned from the company on September 23, 2014, two weeks before the bankruptcy. **One more edit**: I've asked before and I am doing it again now: Pita, please, go 1vs1 AMA with me on Skype or Twitch.

2zkccv	-12440	1426751712	GlobalOffensive	Is Maikelele forced to play for LGB?	On February 11, Maikelele announced, on his Twitter account, that he will play as a stand-in for OrbitGG.On February 14, Per Lilliefelth, NiP's owner, announced that Maikelele can't play for another team because he's tied up with a contract.Now, after more than one month, Maikelele had no other option and he agreed to play for LGB, rather than stay away from pro scene.LGB's owner is the same as NiP's owner. Strange how hltv gave a soft mask to this move, implying that an actual transfer was made.&gt; Ninjas in Pyjamas have not yet commented on Bill's situation, but a statement from LGB refers to him as a "former NiP player", which could mean that the Swedish AWPer has been released from his contract with the ESL One Katowice runners-up.They know that Per Liliefelth is the owner of NiP, LGB, Copenhagen Wolves and Xtrfy (a sponsor of hltv top20). Also, what kind of contract is this? Why Maikelele wasn't able to simply walk away? Remember when Delpan was taken from Fnatic by SK? He simply broke the agreement with fnatic and went to SK. CS doesn't have an entity like football has FIFA, where all the contracts must be showed before a player is able to play for a team. Yet, maikelele's contract made him stay away from CS until he agreed to play for LGB.And it's this fair? Having someone owning more top teams? With all the betting websites, where you can bet real money or bitcoins, I can see it's interesting to own three top teams. And it's fair to other teams/orgas? They shouldn't be allowed to compete in the same tournaments. It's becoming more and more a closed circle, where the casual players are pumping money in 2-3 pockets.

One orga does efforts to provide players with everything to be able to train and travel. They qualify for the major, they go top 8 and slot for the next one is granted. Also, the players take the stickers money. After that they are free in pair of 3 to leave with the slot for the next one.As it is in this case, another orga comes, pays some money (way less than Penta invested in time), they take 3 players and they have a slot for the next major.Again, if it still stands, this rule needs to be changed.Happened to Kaboom -&gt; KeyD, but at least in that case the brazilians had to do a charity to go play a qualifier.

Having ESL-ESEA running things while they care at all about what community and the players need.

3gpsll	-12440	1439383205	GlobalOffensive	Why is Titan in Seed 3 for ESL 1 Cologne and not eBettle? And my q for teams involved: any witnesses to the groups being drawn?	I've rolled groups for ESL 1 Cologne up and down, noticed that 4 teams can actually qualify from the same group, made simulations for possible results and so forth. That's all theory, but the one thing I can get is: Why eBettle is seeded behind Titan overall, leaving aside the fact that they are in the same group.ESL 1 Cologne seeding was made like this:Tier 1 teams, one in each group, were Top4 last major. That's fnatic, NiP, Virtus.Pro and Envyus.Tier 2 teams, one in each group, were places 5th to 8th last major. That's LG (former KeyD), TSM, Na'Vi and Mousesports (former Penta, but Mouz took 3 members from that team).Tier 3 teams, one in each group, were the qualifiers winners. That's eBettle (they won the qualifier after 25-23 against Titan), C9, Renegades and Kinguin.The rest of four teams, Titan, Immunity, CLG and Immunity placed 2nd in the qualifiers and they don't have any seeding, or you can call them Tier 4.However, somehow Titan was placed on the 3rd spot on their group, meaning that they were in Tier 3 group, which is an error. Anyone knows why that is? Any logic behind this? I mean, I'm sure fnatic likes the fact that they'll play the first match against the polish side instead of Titan, but what's the reason behind this? Does anyone know? And other questions I've addressed several times but there is no answer:Why isn't the groups draw live on Twitch? At least teams can witness it?

Broke, min wage, Single, don't get along with family, others avoid me including church fellows :/ All that depressing jazz.  Nothing here for me.I visited some friends in Seattle some years back, fell in love with the Puget sound area, and her people. Naturally I want to move there But I want to take a month's time or so getting there camping on my 883. (Brand new rider here, no brand allegiance here, she was free so I'm not complaining)So the question is what gear shall I slowly acquire to prepare for this trip. I Don't see my future trip staying very long in any desert heat but I may make a stop or two. I'll be camping in Yosemite but the rest of the road will just be wherever the road leads northward.So what durable gear shall I get? tents, cookware, sleepwear, clothes? Camera bag? replace HDD with SSD? (883 vibrates alot, is it an issue for HDD not in use or is that fine?)  Other stuff i'm not thinking about?Once I have this ima save up, sell all my junk and head north.Thanks fellow riders, be safe!

So I have a goal of moving to somewhere in the Puget sound area in a couple years time. Figure those details another time/subreddit.I've been gathering camping gear for awhile, so I can camp along the way. It's only a 20 hr  or so "drive" but I intend to make the most of those 1000-3000+ miles, depending on all the stops and such. Hopefully I can milk this trip to a month or a full season, Winter, Spring, Summer, or Autumn whatever.What I ask of the reddit community is, where should I camp along the way? Special spots to visit, roads to ride along, unique shops to spur economic activity? No destination is out of the way, sort of, within the west coast states, maybe Reno.I only have a couple of spots to visit that are a must. Yosemite, I miss her. I've only been three times as a child during the Independence day holiday rush, also my only camping experience mind you.The second must is Blaine, WA and Point Roberts, WA while I'm there. What is up with that place?Some other places I've considered are:*Some Touristy places like Hollywood and others and anything in that surrounding area*[Deus Ex Machina](http://us.deuscustoms.com/) a moto shop of sorts*Bikini Barista shops*Other Awesome cafes and bars*Awesome dives*Skateboard shops*Theme parks I'm unaware of after leaving South Cali?*Pike Place Market, the EMP and other stuff in that area.Another question I have is, where can one camp for:*Free, paying for every night might get expensive for potentially months of camping*No reservation/permit. I'd rather not deal with those logistics for an extended trip in various places*What lands can I camp anywhere, not a specific developed campsite. Do I need a permit for this? For that place vs this place?Thanks Guys, I truly appreciate any feedback everybody suggests!

I'm relatively new to watching basketball compared to most in this sub, but watching Korver play and looking at his stats each game is nothing short of amazing. The guy is shooting 52% on threes with almost 6 attempts per game. Defenses are well aware of what he can do, and they still cant stop him. Also he hasn't slumped once, hes made a three in something like 97 games in a row. Has there been a season better than this that anyone's seen?
1tnrwz	-12459	1387953832	nba	Is Lance Stephenson a top 5 SG	He shows up and plays hard D every night, hes a perimeter threat, and he can drop 12/7/5 per night with few touches.

If not top 5, maybe 10?
1txlly	-12459	1388306270	nba	Do the Bobcats have one of the better starting 5 in the league?	They have Kemba at PG, who is just a true scorer that can run through a defense at will and sets up his teamates well. Henderson at SG, also mainly just a scorer but knocks down an open 3 with ease and plays good D, MKG at SF, one of the best hustle players and perimeter defenders in the league, Josh McRoberts at PF, a great 10-5-5 guy who plays solid D and knows his role on the team, then Al Jefferson at C. Hes a solid scorer with bad D, but he grabs the boards and is a 3rd scoring option that takes attention away from Kemba and Henderson. Are these guys way underestimated?

Hey there, let me start with a link to my Barb.[http://us.battle.net/d3/en/profile/dusty129-1144/hero/7226980](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/profile/dusty129-1144/hero/7226980)As the title mentions, I just started a WW spec for the first time but the few changes in gear resulted in an over 30k loss of dps. Before this, I was using a 1349 dps Skorn with a Rend build that had 89k unbuffed dps.I'd like to keep the WW spec, it seems much more fun and fluid than my previous spec. I have no problems keeping up WW and I'm now able to survive pretty well, but mobs do take quite a while to die! Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Hello!First off: [Here's the link to my decks](http://www.mtgvault.com/dusty129)I've been working on getting at least two of my decks ready for use in a FNM Legacy tournament, and I'm wanting to see how you guys feel about it: whether there's obvious improvements needed or if they seem pretty solid.The two decks I'm working on right now is the Legacy Reanimator deck and the Counter Rebels deck. Reanimator is straight forward, and I feel most confident about it. Counter Rebels needs better lands, and perhaps a few better rebels.Let me know what you think, and thank you very much for the guidance!

First: should I use Putrid Imp instead of Zombie Infestation? My thinking is that the imp is one mana cheaper, and only requires one discard.Second: I'd like to get Lotus Petals in the deck, but I'm not sure what should get the axe. I think 2 swamps should go, but any thoughts on what else?OH YEAH! I also don't have any sideboard at the moment. What should I be looking for??Thank you guys for the input!

I want to build this deck mainly for casual play, and want to see if I'm missing something completely obvious that could greatly improve on it.It's a Torpor Orb combo deck, with 4 different creatures that seem to fit well. It won't win tournaments, I just want to play some fun big creatures that usually aren't used.The only thing I know of so far is to switch Diabolic Tutors for Vampiric Tutors (when I have more money!). Is there anything else you can think of that obviously belongs in here that I've simply overlooked?[Here's the deck](http://deckbox.org/sets/482605) (As you can see, still under construction)
1o89hc	-12470	1381508877	magicTCG	Elf Deck needs Help!	[Here's the deck](http://www.mtgvault.com/dusty129/decks/elf-deck/)I'm trying to build my elf deck up to be viable again. I sold off my Gaea's Cradles when I wasn't playing, so I know for a fact I need to get those back in here. I replaced them with Elvish Archdruids...which are nice, but nowhere near the same.My main issue now is I have several cheap creatures, but also several very expensive cards. Recently added are the Craterhoof Behemoths, which can be great. But those are expensive mana-wise, and I'm looking for a way to cut down on that. I'm also looking at removing the Deranged Hermits. Right now I'm thinking of replacing them with [Saproling Symbiosis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=saproling%20symbiosis) in an attempt to provide faster creatures, and in effect beef up the ability of the Behemoths.Also, are there any essential elves I might be missing? The deck was originally constructed 12 years ago. Though I've done some research into new cards, I want to make sure I'm not missing something completely obvious. And, with Elvish Spirit Guides, I've opted out of adding Lotus Petals. But....should they be added as well, or would that be overkill?Thanks so much for the input!

3342hk	-12481	1429435564	blackops3	BO2: Either gonna kill CoD or bring it back	So in my opinion Black Ops 2 is the all time best CoD ever. At first I hated Ghosts but after Advanced Warfare came out Ghost didn't seem that bad. I even kinda like it now. But CoD is obviously going downhill. Advanced Warfare is the biggest pile of crap. Especially with the bullshit Exo suits and the new movement shit. So since CoD's going downhill in my opinion, Black Ops 3 is either going to continue the best CoD and is gonna be awesome or it will just be bullshit, especially if there will be stuff like Exo (I like to call it flying). If it's gonna be bullshit, I'm gonna stop playing CoD because I don't think they'll "revive" CoD. I'd even love the game if it just was the same as Black Ops 2. So hopefully they won't just get a bowl, fill it with crap and call it the new CoD this time. Also what would be cool is if there was a large amount of gametypes or modes like League, Face offs from MW3 would be cool, Spec Ops (I know face off and spec ops won't come though, I'm just saying). But SnD should just stay like it is. Sorry for the long post and bad English. Have a cookie 🍪.

You can play with me under some conditions:•You need to be a good player because scrimming should improve the tactics and skills of any player and I can't improve those against "not so skilled" players and of course I want a challenge.•Don't rage or get annoyed when losing. Losing is part of the game and means you did something wrong or the enemys were just better. I prefer a fun, close or intense game against good players and losing over just winning a boring game.•You should have a mic or headset for callouts and stuff. Communication is the key to win, my friends.-That's all. If you're interested add redzero77 and WRITE Reddit because I have 80+ friend requests at the moment. But I'll definitely accept asap.

I don't mind people playing league, it's just that they always get in my team (I'm platinum). I was rank 2 with 5500 points but now I'm 10 with 4570 points. I lost 10+ games in a row ONLY because of screendashing teammates, getting booted, bad teammates and aimbotter. I usually try to be very calm. But I'm insanely mad right now. No offence against French people but 90% of booters on PS3 are French. Double win: I got booted by my own French teammates: 3 about 10 y/o French kids in my team, 0.6k/d, 30w/n. I get booted while I was carrying them and winning 4-0 (I know the name of the booter). Back to the title. I see an increasing interest of bad players in League Play. Btw: This post will get so much hate but I couldn't care less right now. Another example: SnD: Me: "All right, I can carry... 6-3 lost. Score: Me: 14-6, teammates ALL: 0-9, 0-6, 0-7.

Obviously the name could be different and more creative and clever. At least have something that'll do the job. If someone has posted a similar post like this prior to mine, I have not seen it, so sorry if someone has. Anyways peace.
1t7jas	-12510	1387412528	ultrahardcore	Weapon of interest?	^^^MyapologiesifthishasbeenpostedbeforeHi guys! This idea just suddenly came up and decided to post it.This scenario is to kind of/maybe/possibly balance out the OPness of enchants with swords and such. So lets say you put all different kinds of things in a randomnizer and every 10 min(might change) a different "weapon" is chosen.EXAMPLE: The game starts like any vanilla game would and after 20 min orso the host will say that the weapon of interest will be randomnized(the sword is then for the first 20 min the "weapon of choice"). When the randomnizer picks a wooden hoe, the wooden hoe becomes the weapon of choice. After a set amount of time a new one will be randomnized.If bows belong in there, thats up to you. Swords are obviously in the mix.O so that was it! Please leave feedback(if youd like to). Bye guys!EDIT: Only tools are allowed in the mix.

But all was fine and dandy, everyone was understanding - which I highly appreciate.  And the game resumed. Oh and pvp was a bitch. I had to try multiple commands before it *finallly* turned on.

2i3not	-12510	1412266319	ConquestNetwork	Cereal's Amazing Amazonian Series Rules And General Information	Hey there. Now read.-----------------CAAS is the hosting name I go under. Don't ask me how or why I came up and am using it. I just am, okay?-----------Conquest is a 4GB server in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The server host is Minecrafted.net. The maximum amount of slots are 80.------------------**PVP And Such**PVP is ***5 minutes in.***[1] Remember that. If you didn't realize before, that means stalking and stealing are also allowed. You can tower and fort all you want. But. You must come down at MU. If you're not down within the set time I've given you, you will be DQ'd or banned or whatever. OR WAIT. I'LL HIT YOU OFF OF IT. YEAH. I LIKE THAT.---------------- **Environment***Nether*Check the post to see if it's enabled or not.**Trapping** *and* **camping** *are both* **allowed.**And, yes. Don't be dumb. Strength is nerfed.*Overworld*Perma will usually be enabled when there's 15-20 minutes remaining.With the whole PVP situation, then the maps will have to be atleast 1500x1500. **Blastmining, Pokeholes and branchmining are not allowed.** Usually depends on the severity. I usually give 1 warning, after that a ban.You must start a staircase from Y=32 and higher.--------------**Chat and Communication**[2]Respect all other players.Racism, homophobia, and other general harassment is not tolerated, and will result in mutes or bans depending on the situation at the discretion of the host.Spamming is not cool, bro. In fact, it's so uncool that we will more than likely ban you.Spoiling is not allowed after you've died. To avoid accidentally spoiling things, say "GG" and log out after you die. Blatant spoiling will result in a temporary ban.------------Numbers[1] Basically ever game. If it's a specific scenario which requires it from like 15 minutes in, like Mole, it will be turned on when Moles are set and such.[2] Taken directly from /u/ShutUpBrick. Always agreed with that, and most likely always will.

I've decided to give plugins the priority. But. If the skript's better/plugin less stable, the skript will have the priority.

2qq26r	-12510	1419872395	rant	Redditing while on a phone	This fucking irritates me so much. I hate it so fucking much. It's so fucking, fucking annoying.The infamous line:&gt; Sorry for poor formatting, I'm on my phoneOr even:&gt; Sorry for the typo guys, I'm on my phoneIt's not that hard to adjust. Really. I usually Reddit while I'm on my phone, so I am sort of biased, but this is god awful. Instead of fucking apologizing, why not fucking correct your mistakes? Or "format" it better? Take my advice: Don't bitch about being on Reddit while you're on your phone. If you spot any mistakes, correct them, like you would while you were on your computer.For anyone who has done this, why is it difficult?EDIT: This would've been better if I did this while I was on my phone.

I bought a ticket to How The Grouch Stole Christmas show (the Grouch, Eligh, DJ Abilities, Cunninlynguists, DJ Fresh, Scarub, and Sunspot) at the Fillmore this Friday. My friends aren't into any of the artists, (or too into hip-hop for that matter) so I just bought a ticket for myself as I didn't want to miss the show. Going alone seems pretty lame, so I figured I would see if anyone else local was going and wouldn't mind having someone else join them. I'll roll a couple pre-show blunts/joints as an offering. Haha.

I started Keto with the 90 day challenge posted last week and tomorrow marks one week. I definitely felt the keto flu and so far I have lost about 5 pounds. I have been meeting my macros, but I am at a huge calorie deficit. I am not hungry however, and I only eat whenever hungry. I bought some ketostix to make sure I was in Ketosis and they come up at a small amount. I guess my question is, am I supposed to feel different? Am I doing something wrong here?Thank you!

35h1ab	-12533	1431242633	blackladies	Can I rant for a minute?	I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and as you know the tech business is taking over. I have poured my heart, soul, and roots into this community. I grew up here, my parents grew up here, and to watch it being stripped of culture, and diversity is breaking my heart. Rent is skyrocketing, to the point where I am even debating if it makes financial sense to stay here. But, why should I have to leave *my* home? Sure, the tech business is bringing much needed money to the Bay Area, but at what expense? It just makes me sad, y'all. I would even agree to cohabitation instead of the companies just barging their way in, bringing in people from out of state, and pushing the diversity out. I remember a few years ago when Obama was visiting in the area there was a short snippet in a paper here. The snippet was about an elementary school boy in the mission district (a historically predominately hispanic neighborhood) who had asked one of Obama's secret service members when "the white people were leaving the mission". I'm sorry kid, looks like they are here to stay. Okay thats the end of my rant. *sigh*

3h8cvc	-12533	1439754965	ploompax	Just purchased my first Pax, it gets so hot its unusable.	I just purchased my first pax yesterday, a pax 2, and for the most part I love it. My major concern is how hot the pax 2 gets. If I use the pax on the one or two petal option, I can hold the device for maybe 3 draws before it becomes too hot to use and I have to turn it off until it cools completely. If I want to continue to use the device I have to wrap a sock around it to keep from burning myself. I use the raised mouthpiece option because the outside metal *will* burn my lips.I don't see any funky or different light patterns. I draw from the pax when it's green and I use slow steady draws. As for the oven, I grind my trees in a Sharp Stone grinder. Its not as fine as some of the grinds I'll usually see in the ovens in pictures. But at the end the burned bud is all a dark brown consistency.Does the Pax normally get this hot? I don't know anyone else who has a pax and I want to be able to use it without burning myself.

It was the height of instant messenger and the premise was that the girl started talking to a stranger from her area online.  She was in love with some cute guy at school but she was falling for the guy online as well.  She liked the fact that he would type out "okay" instead of "ok."

22sgeu	-12576	1397235168	dayz	How many people is too many?	I'm thinking about recent announcements of H1Z1, and the capability of 2000+ player servers or something to that effect. I read recently about DayZ having 120+ players on one server, eventually, and possibly more planned in the future. That is where my question lies. How many players is too many for the map? Let me be clear. What I mean by this is how many players can there be before everything is just complete chaos? 2000+ bandits would not be pretty, or maybe it would be kind of beautiful. What is the maximum population planned in the future at this moment?
230kih	-12576	1397493513	dayz	Heat exhaustion	Considering future plans to add temperature, and the effects of cold, penalties for running, etc.I've seen speculation on cold and your wet status coinciding. In real life, if you're soaking wet and it's freezing out, you're probably gonna die. Could we see your thirst level, and the heat in the environment effect your gear selection? I picture it's summer, I'm thirsty, hungry. I've got a motorcycle helmet, a raincoat, and a nice tactical vest on to really warm me up, not to mention a bag full of heavy loot. Oh, and I've been sprinting at top speed for 10 minutes. Not only would I feel pretty dehydrated, but I'd probably be close to passing out. I'm under the impression that, in the future, carry weight will effect your character in some ways. More weight could mean slower running speed, or possibly faster fatigue rate, faster hunger/thirst progression.When Winter is added, won't we need to find a thick coat to prevent hypothermia? Will we be able to run around as new spawns in just underwear for long? I don't think so, you'll freeze. So why should fully uniformed military players not overheat in all their gear? To reiterate on heat exhaustion, my idea is it could just "spike" when the right conditions are met. You'd probably be orange/red thirst, running at top speed, fully kitted and wielding an m4 ( your character would be breathing hard as hell) and your status would spike, and could say in redtext "I think I'm going to pass out" or maybe the screen goes blurry. If you kept running, you'd probably go unconscious in a few seconds. If you stop, you might have a few more seconds to sit down and drink water to keep from passing out, unless you have no supplies, in which case you're screwed. Picture this, same situation, only you're running from three bandits who want to feed you Cherry Disinfectant-Aid to quench that thirst. You're at a full sprint, weaving between trees and bullets, panting heavily *I think I'm going to pass out* oh shit. What do I do? Find cover and pass out? Keep running and pass out? 10 seconds later, you ragdoll into the ground. Maybe I should have focused on survival instead of gearing up from the get go. I think it could be interesting. What are your thoughts?
23gsvb	-12576	1397944935	dayz	[Suggestion] Audio-tape recorder	I've seen this idea already, but I want to expand on it a little better.It would take the same inventory space as a walkie, be battery operated, and must have a tape to function, so it would come in three parts.You could record a message, replay it, or set it on repeat. I imagine this would be a good way to cause a distraction. "Help, my legs are broken. Save me."I also think you could use a pen to write small messages on the front.Thoughts?
25qmp8	-12576	1400271267	dayz	Stomping.	So I have seen this idea before, but it only talked about stomping on Zombies.We have two legs, yet we can only punch. I imagine the animation would be someone just stomping one foot on the ground. My initial thought was just a way to break someone's legs without using a weapon. Currently if you want to break someone's legs and leave them to die, or break their legs so they can't punch you, you have to use a gun.  When you shoot someone in the legs you lose a round, they bleed, you lose a bandage if you heal them, and everyone within 1000m heard you shooting. If you could just stomp on them, breaking their legs or caving in their skull, all that noise would be avoided. This makes sense to do if ammo/guns were very limited.If someone was crouched or standing, I can't see stomping on their toes being very effective.There are options. It could just be a wheel-click animation, only useful on an unconscious body, which could be "break legs" or "crush skull" or an actual animation you could use in combat.Either way, I know it would take months to implement.Thoughts?
25vyu8	-12576	1400445992	dayz	[Suggestion] Spiked leather	This is what I imagine. A single spike, or could be a stack of them. Either found or created (if we can eventually craft bolts, this doesn't seem too far off from feasible.)They could be added to leather objects, such as the Riders Jacket, to make it appear spiked while also potentially causing damage to the assailant rather than the wearer. If you're trying to punch someone in the head, and they've got spikes on their shoulders, you might hurt yourself.With the release of hunting and eventually crafting, I could see other leather possibilities that potentially would be spikeable. Gloves, bracelets, jackets, helmets, collars, pants (or leather chaps over pants), boots, etc. Yes, BDSM. Even a spiked whip would be possible (maybe). I could see a lot of sick bandits handcuffing and torturing newspawns as their "Leather Daddy".This would be applicable to your companion animal as well (spiked collar for protection from wildlife) that is planned for the future. I can see a lot of potential for spiking objects.What else do you think would make this a practical idea?
2fap5p	-12576	1409693498	dayz	[Suggestion] Blowing up gas canisters	I haven't seen this posted anywhere, but the idea seems pretty simple.Basically, shooting a blue gas canister would cause it to blow up into a fireball! The size of the explosion would coincide with the container. Imagine you walk into a house and a harmless canister sits there. You suddenly hear a pistol shot and an explosion before your screen goes black. I imagine you might be careful seeing another canister. If gas trails were ever possible one day even, you could light the trail from a safe distance and watch it blow.Thoughts? What would be adequate sized explosions for the different canisters? Would the damage level have any effect?
2fww5j	-12576	1410275982	dayz	Mufflers	This is what I imagine. You stumble upon a car, you find all the parts to fix it up only to find you don't have a muffler. Basically when starting up the car it would bang loudly, and give yourself away if anyone is nearby. Finding a muffler would probably be easy. The hard part is finding a good one. I'm sure most mufflers would be rusty and damaged in DayZ. It could also double as a melee weapon, although it would be little better/worse than the baseball bat.
2g0nlh	-12576	1410366803	dayz	Does the addition of non-lethal weapons spell the end of knockout punches?	What I mean by this is does the addition of cattle prods, stun batons, and future 1-hit-ko weapons mean the power of fists will be turned down? 
2j2a3h	-12576	1413152466	spaceengineers	Who would want to team up with me?	So let me tell you a little about my history. I've played SE for about 200hrs. The only way I find people to play with online is usually playing by myself until I eventually find someone decent in the world then we team up. That was my strategy is DayZ but my SE career is rather lonely.I've never just gone up and asked random people if they want to play, i.e. what I'm doing now. Just trying something new makes me feel tense. I don't even know what the first step is!I've only played Vanilla SE for now, but I'm interested in trying Mods. Darkness seems cool. I also very much like the 1 1 1 type of survival. I just want like-minded people who like building but don't mind occasional PvP. Anyone got any words?
2jpr5e	-12576	1413746733	spaceengineers	Ideas of Plasma, weapons, and practical applications?	I'm absolutely sure this has been suggested, but I'm just curious what it could entail. I'm not sure of the current or future limitations of the  physics engine, but I imagine the plasma itself would be gel-like in nature. It would stick to anything that moves through it and melt anything it's touching. If anyone has seen a video demonstrating a gravity cannon, I imagine it could be propelled at others that way? Imagine offensive ships with this, or on stations for a "burning oil" type of defense. I also wonder what the practical applications would be. Perhaps adding plasma to a special container could work as a trash disposal? But one thought comes to mind: How would you defend against it? With normal weapons there are many floating parts and scrap metal, with plasma weapons there would be none.What are your thoughts?
2jq3op	-12576	1413753743	spaceengineers	[Suggestion ]Molten iron weaponry	This is my idea: You already have refineries; they melt material down into ingots. What if you could store just the molten iron? If you had special containers or blocks  (made of a metal with high melting point perhaps?) That could hook up to a dispenser (or some kind of sprayer) to the container and voila. The iron would come out hot and burning, damaging mostly and not destroying while also rapidly cooling and  hardening. You could spray it on turrets to disable without having to destroy them, or on thrusters to temporarily cover them. Or maybe a big hole in your ship for a quick fortify? I'm not sure. To remove it just grind away. What do you think?
2l8uhb	-12576	1415090048	spaceengineers	How feasible is a camera turret?	This idea crossed my mind and I wanted to discuss it. With the addition of controlling a turret  remotely, you basically have a camera with much more range of vision. I imagine the same is/would be of the small interior turret. Since the ability is there, why is a rotating camera-only-turret type of block not a possibility?

2p09k9	-12576	1418330055	relationships	Me [23 M] with my Fiance [23 F] duration, of 3 years. Santa Clause is a fun lie for kids?	My fiance and I have been together for a while and know we want to have kids one day, so we talk about what we would teach them and how we would be as parents and whatnot. We have touched this subject a few times but for some reason we shrug off the subject when we start to clash.She as a child loved Santa and when she found out he wasn't real it was no big deal, she already kinda figured. When I was a kid I denied Santa wasn't real for years after I was told he didn't exist. I had a hard time letting go. I want to approach Santa when our (future) kids ask, and tell them he is not real he is just a symbol of the spirit of Christmas. My fiance wants to do the whole Santa is real deal. Santa's Lap at the mall, Santa is coming, etc. I am not into it at all. I don't want to lie to our kids.I feel like it is just lying to them to make them act a certain way. ---   **tl;dr**: Is it better to be honest with our future kids or lie and pretend Santa Clause is real for "fun"?

2spk50	-12576	1421472719	spaceengineers	[Idea] Tungsten as a new material	Tungsten is just as abundant as uranium or gold in a real asteroid.It has an extremely high melting point, 3422°c.Comparably dense to gold and almost twice as dense as lead.It has numerous alloy capabilities that are used in light bulb filaments, x-ray tubes, welding, radiation shielding, and military applications.Due to the extreme hardness and density of tungsten it is extremely effective in penetrating projectiles. Tungsten bullets.Imagine scanning the inside of a ship for its interior to get a rough layout? X-rays.I can see a new material such as this, being as it already exists in reality in asteroids, would not be out of place. It would open up the possibility for more military and radar applications.What do you guys think?
2ta6nm	-12576	1421929779	MedievalEngineers	Will we finally be able to grab things?	This is my imagination: I imagine starting out in ME with just my clothes and some simple tools. Of course chop some wood first, but with the plans for storage being realistic, I have to make a cart of some kind to hold some materials asap. Perhaps I can make a simple handcart that I can move back and forth myself to move the wood? Otherwise, horse or bull would be some other options for when you start to need to get more and bigger quantities. Not to mention where you would acquire these, as I doubt it would be readily available at first (making me think hands will be important)Not to mention, how are you going to move all that dirt and gravel from digging and mining? A wheelbarrow you can move by hand is the best idea I can think of. Actually, some kind of medieval drill is the best idea I can think of. I don't know how I'll do that yet though.Plus, how are we supposed to pick up stuff off the ground? Would we just highlight it and drag and drop it physically into a container? Hands would be cool too.Just my thoughts, what do you think?
2tkggg	-12576	1422146803	MedievalEngineers	Underground defense	I had this idea and I want to know what people think.Imagine you are sitting in your castle keep, admiring your beautiful craftsmanship when you hear a muffled rumbling. Over a few minutes it steadily intensifies but the location is indescernable. You panic as you run from tower to tower, trying to spot your enemy but the noise is now deafening. Seemingly coming from everywhere. The ground begins to shake and the floor begins to quake as you see a wall crumble into the ground. Not far off a stone windmill suddenly gets swallowed by the earth, reclaimed. You stand at your tower keep in horror as the tower starts to shake violently. Your eyes dart below and the earth beneath churns like acid, surely to dissolve your soul. In desperation you leap into nothing, accepting fate, only to land on a stack of hay.You are shocked but aware, bounding from the hay and dashing to the center of your fortress only to see that to your increasing horror the same fate is met by all of your precious buildings. You turn away, swallowing the regret of defeat. A few moments go by as the destruction surrounds you and then stops, it settles.You see out of the ground emerge a large wooden box with wheels and a stone drill on the front and a door on the side. It slowly crawls out of the ground and parks on the flat ground. You see the door open and four engineers come out. In the moments before the inevitable beating you glance inside the caravan and notice the sophisticated inner workings hoping to make something similar.tl;dr So my idea is I wonder if it will be possible to burrow under people's castles to cave in their buildings? Thoughts?

2v0dfb	-12576	1423248057	changemyview	CMV: Prison should be abolished and replaced with mandatory rehab	Prison is a colossal failure. The recidivism rate across many states seems to be near 2/3, so 2/3 of people who get sent to prison inevitably go back. To me this seems like a designed feature. The private prison industry is a blight on mankind. The people involved actually make a profit off of cheap/forced labor from prisoners. Why wouldn't they want big tough convicts to come back in for another quarter? Many of the most violent, psychotic, bloody murdering psychopaths were born as a baby. Somewhere down the line, due to events usually out of their control, they go down a path that leads them to be imprisoned. I believe a person that is so far gone that they must constantly return to prison is extremely sad to behold. Why don't we get to the real psychological issue?Everyone has a reason for being who they are. I believe any offense no matter how big or small should not receive any prison/jail whatsoever. Instead the person(s) should be sentenced to varying lengths of rehabilitation.Mandatory therapy, group therapy, everything and anything. I believe we should find the root of the anger/depression/etc causing them to commit crimes instead of simply throwing them behind bars. Recurring prisoners are on a different level of communication, they simply cannot interact with normal society anymore. They need help.We need to help our fellow humans, no matter what. Tl;dr: No one should be imprisoned. We should sentence mandatory rehab until the true issue is absolved

I don't know the first thing about selling so that's off the table. I am just screwed.

2w05ud	-12576	1424033449	MedievalEngineers	What keeps a Rotar spinning? [discussing the future of rotors]	I'm not asking how you make it rotate, I am curious about what keeps the rotar spinning? It has no other force acting on and just rotates, so I'm guessing this is a placeholder? There is no electricity, so I'm thinking it shouldn't be able to spin forever in survival (once survival is implemented). Perhaps this is what windmills will eventually be used for? I would see windmills and watermills connected to a rotor keeping all your stuff moving when you're not around.What does everyone else think?
2w0gs6	-12576	1424038718	MedievalEngineers	[suggestion] Hay bales	(This will probably only affect survival)This is my thought: How often will we fall to our deaths?Let's say you're building a tall tower. Chances are, you will accidentally fall and die. If you had some hay bales where you landed, it could potentially limit the damage taken (but not eliminate it). Causing you to take damage but not get killed. I imagine it would be a small block that you could stack side to side and on itself. When you fell and landed on it, it would be have structural integrity that would cause it to collapse but would also cushion your fall.I feel like this idea could be better. What do you think?
2wmoek	-12576	1424495936	MedievalEngineers	Procedurally generated ruins?	I had this idea and I wanted to share. Other than mountains and trees, what else will be procedurally generated?Stone, iron, wood etc will need to be refined someway to make it usable. Just like in SE.In SE you are able to mine materials, or you can find ships as an alternative. In ME I am guessing stone ruins, wooden fortresses, maybe even ghost towns generated procedurally as a source of materials that would act as an alternative to conventional resource gathering. Thoughts?
2ycqc6	-12576	1425836684	2007scape	My thoughts on bot detection	I wanted to make this reply on another thread but they deleted their post. I feel my thoughts are relevant and I wanted to share to get some opinions:Sometimes, like any system, there can be flaws.  Their system can pick up on a lot of bots but it is still a machine trying to detect another machine.When you see a bot it's usually obvious, correct? You report them and move along. Jagex gets your report and probably just observes the bot until it's obvious to them too, then ban. Their system is not perfect, I can't imagine how sophisticated it would need to be in order to detect everything swiftly. Some get found right away, others do not. This is where the problem lies. From my perspective people are apathetic and feel as if Jagex will eventually disintegrate all the bots in a puff of smoke one day, and then complain about the bots still being there. The truth is that bots affect the players and it's up to the players to help Jagex root them out. If no players put effort towards eliminating something they didn't like and only complained it would only appear as a bunch of complainers but not constructive players. Also a lack of player reports would show a lack of community interest in bots. The report feature is a way to point out problems because humans are just better at detection, and work as a sort of diagnostic tool for keeping track of how many reports to what. It's also worth mentioning that 40000 players can potentially detect more bots than one detection engine.If the community as a whole upped their reporting game it would eliminate more undetected bots and as a result the number of reports to Jagex would show the importance from the community.Players affect the game, and if bots go unreported they can go unbanned. If players pass the buck, bots go unbanned. We just need to work together as a community, together with Jagex, to fix issues with the game.
2z19tb	-12576	1426353290	raisedbynarcissists	What is it with N's and silence in the car?	I've tried posting here before but I always get too nervous.On car trips one thing my nMom would do is almost never talk or play the radio. If my brother or I talked to the other she would glare at us until we stopped. She gave us dirty looks our whole life. I never felt like she was happy with me.It was a van so we always sat in the backseat, we didn't want to sit upfront with her. If we got into an argument, my brother and I, she would turn around and start smacking us while driving.Has anyone had a similar experience?
30rokf	-12576	1427685256	relationships	My fiance [23F] gets angry if I [23M] ask her questions	So we have been together for almost four years. We have always had this problem.I do this thing where I disassociate a lot. I came from an abusive household. I'll try to listen but it's very hard for me to pay attention. Usually I'll hear half of something or realize someone is speaking to me and I ask "what?" or "say again" or I will try to repeat what I thought they said as a question back to them to make sure I got it right.My fiance gets angry with me if I ask her what she said and usually says "nevermind" or is visibly disturbed that I'm making her repeat herself. If I paraphrase something back to her like I said previously she will get frustrated and say something along the lines of "are you even listening?"Example: Today she said she wished she could have gone skateboarding. I heard skateboard, so I asked "You wish we had skateboards?" She sighs in frustration and says, "No, ugh! I said I wish we could go skateboarding! Aren't you even listening?"I got really angry at that point. This is only one of many times this has happened.I want her to respect me and when she treats me like that I get anxiety from the disrespect and I end up feeling furious. Can anyone offer me advice?Tl;dr: If I ask my fiance questions about what she said she gets angry and thinks I'm not listening.

3172y6	-12576	1427985933	dayz	Can't find loot? Go inland	I've heard servers with low traffic don't spawn as much loot as fuller servers. I think this might be because if there are more people picking up objects, more objects are spawning somewhere else. So if only one person is picking up objects the spawn rate would be very low.So if you can't find anything on the coast, go inland and try again.
3174hg	-12576	1427986656	dayz	Will there be a "smell" feature?	This is my thought process:Gas, tincture, (eventually other alcohols) water, etc, are all liquids which will eventually be able to be put in containers. You could eventually have a drum full of gas or water for example.How will we tell what certain liquid is in a container? You could just examine it, it would tell you "this drum contains gas" and you would know.Would you possibly "smell" the container to tell what is inside? "This smells like gas". And know that way?Or just "A drum with gas" no flair.Honestly, what is the best way in your mind to tell what will be in a container?

You could use an improved bow and a stick, or the old fashioned technique of your hands and some sticks plus patience, even flint &amp; steel.Does the idea of alternative methods to starting a fire sound interesting? Or do you feel scavenging for that elusive box of matches is necessary to the core of the game?It's probably even already in the works! Give me your thoughts!
31dswe	-12576	1428116083	dayz	Tips for starting a camp?	So I've been at it about 10 hours today, died 5 times. Each time I tried to set up with a camp but I was plagued with some problems, such as:1. I set up a tent in the Southeast section of the map but still a good distance from the coast. Then the server got reset in a way that my tent was deleted. Let's try again.2. I set up another tent in the sameish area but hidden as best I could. I came back 1 1/2 later and it was gone so someone probably found it.3. I traveled to the center of the map and set up again (in a wooded area, on a mountain practically), but got killed, then came back to nothing.4. I made my way to the northern border and found a wooded area on top of a steep hill to set up two tents. I went out looting and found a chainsaw and some other things, come back to my camp and it's still there. I put some things in the tent when the server resets (the server message stated it was resetting) and come back in. Both tents are gone, and I say to myself "Damnit..." and then I get the "You Are Dead" screen. Okay? That's DayZ I guess.And so yeah, I'm having very bad luck and I need help.Should I just throw a backpack on the ground and leave it? I just cannot find a way to store anything I find, I'm stuck
31hf9o	-12576	1428201755	dayz	Persistance is not actually working at all, correct?	This is the same story you've probably already heard before. I tried seeing if backpacks would be persistant but they are not either.I came back after a while of not playing because it seemed as if setting up a camp was possible but now I know it's not. Maybe another few patches and persistance will be truely configured? I'm not sure. Anyone else have a similar experience?
31nnqy	-12576	1428345927	dayz	Hot/Cold packs and Thermos	I like to think about simple things that I personally hope will be added or I probably can add to the game one day through mods. Typically things that don't make or break anything, just simpleness.This is my thought: We have a RED status around things that are hot. I've read before that winter is a definite possibility in the future of DayZ. Because of that, I can see a BLUE status around things that are frozen, slowly fading until it isn't colored which would mean it's thawed. Of course we will be able to craft our own meals, not just cook single items. My idea probably isn't original, the devs must be thinking of special containers used to keep things hotter/colder longer already. If you eat a hot steak it should warm you a bit if you're cold, just like a cold soda cools you down a bit. Slightly but not dramatically, adding up to warm someone up (I'm picturing a nearly hypothermic person sipping hot soup and perking up slightly. Maybe reducing the shakes to make them more manageable and not gone altogether. I have had mild hypothermia and eating a bowl of hot oatmeal made me a lot less shaky, but not completely)Speaking of stew, I had this idea of how to craft it. You would start with a pot of water, adding whatever vegetables and meat you want (limited to how much it can fit) and then take the pot and cook it in a crafted oven or put the pot in your hands and cook it over the fire that way. Watching it carefully so it doesn't burn like everything else. When consumed you would receive hunger equal to if you had eaten everything separately, plus a little water from the broth. It would stuff you the same as well, and will take longer to make, but saves you time in a situation where you are scavenging and not meaning to set-up camp (due to the benefits and it takes the same amount of time to eat as something else.)Back to my discussion, of course a hot item in your inventory will cool it down rapidly, even more so in winter, so that's why a thermos or a hot/cold pack would be the perfect container to keep hot things hot and cold things cold.Frankly, when temperature is more concrete I feel like an item such as a pristine thermos would be quite valuable. It would let food/water stay hot/cold for a while longer, essentially letting you travel longer without having to stop to make a fire and warm up, and let you drink cool water to cool yourself down even it's summer and you're sweating in your heavy gear.This makes me think that if you're in hot weather, sweating in your gear, running all over the place (and probably very little stamina) you're going to count on a bottle of water to keep you from getting heat exhaustion. A thermos that you filled up with cold spring water an hour before would be a bit better but definitely useful. A paralellel to that could be having to strap a heating pad to your water bottles to prevent them from freezing in winter.I have a lot more thoughts when it comes to this but I want to see what anyone else thinks. Thanks!

I'm creeping along when I hear the first half a second of a chainsaw coming down, and let me tell you that's all you need to scare you. It doesn't end there though. Over the past 20 minutes I have been hit with constant ambient chainsaw noises, the worst being when I heard the entire animation, even though there was no one there. I thought the Ghost of the Texas Chainsaw Killer was coming after me.Anyone else being affected by this?
31wbgw	-12576	1428515019	dayz	What should happen to dead bodies (Zombies)	I feel like I have a different kind of opinion. When a person dies, it should start to attract a nearby zombie. A Zombie could be nearby due to gunshots or just wandering. It would see or smell the body, and run towards it, then begin frantically clawing and feeding on the corpse. I think it would be blind to the world around it at that point. It would be making loud disgusting smacking and grunting (it's starving after all) and soon enough, another Zombie would be attracted to the noise and crowd around the corpse, gnawing on it viciously. Creating a lot of noise and attracting a swarm of Zombies in the area. The corpse would disappear (maybe only leaving bones) and the gear on the person would become damaged or possibly ruined from the clawing and feeding.Why? If you die, you should be dead. Your gear should die with you, and it makes an interesting scene to find doesn't it? It would also make Zombies more vicious and grizzly. If Zombies start swarming the guy you just shot to death and you have to run to save yourself, maybe that would force people to think about making that shot. Let's also say your legs are broken and a Zombie finds you, it would begin to feed on you. If you're in a firefight, there's Zombies coming in from the shots and swarming around dead bodies. Not only that, the Zombies that can't get a corpse come for you. You run into a building and lock the door but they know where you are. They slam into the door repeatedly, yelling and growling all the while attracting more Zombies to the door until it breaks and so do you. They overload the house. You can never have enough bullets, but you still bloody try in a blaze of glory.I feel this might pull away from "Look, free gear! *shoots*" to "Do I risk the Zombie swarm?"Of course, this is an idea far away from possibility, but what I believe to be the true direction Zombies should be headed. Thoughts?
326f7w	-12576	1428709479	dayz	Can we get a super tall Radio Tower?	The world's tallest tower: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVLY-TV_mastA video detailing climbing a tower: https://youtu.be/hFMHjDqHL_YA Russian radio tower built in 1967 nearly as tall: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostankino_TowerSo my idea is just a single tall structure. The reason I thought of this is because it would be cool to have a hard to reach vantage point, lined with slip ups and falls to your death, that rewards you with a strategic view of points of interest from an aerial perspective without the need for an aerial vehicle. Those brave enough would receive a very nice view of a big portion of the map, albeit everything would be very tiny from way up. At the top of the tower in the video they can see over 50 miles from the top.The climb is treacherous and you'll find yourself falling a lot without proper climbing accessories.What does everyone think?
326j6j	-12576	1428711633	dayz	What would happen if guns didn't respawn after being destroyed? (Or, what if guns were craftable?)	Yes you heard me right, will we craft guns one day, or will finding a gun always be a mainstay?Of course it wouldn't make sense to craft any of the current guns, it would have to be improvised versions made of pipes/wood or something like that. Bullets could be crafted too, you can even make bullets out of wood.Let me tell you my thought process. Vegetables are only added to the world from players, never spawning except when grown. Same with crafted improvised arrows, bows, splints, rags, improv backpack, leather.Now, imagine (bear with me) a DayZ where guns were the same way.I do not doubt someone somewhere will have a crafted-weapons-only (no gun spawns) server in the future to fit that particular playstyle when modding becomes available.Does anyone have anything to contribute?

33e567	-12576	1429646741	dayz	What is the point of using lightsources?	I'm talking about the Gamma exploit of course. Anyone can crank their Gamma to max easy peezy and see like they have night-vision goggles. There are no consequences to this. The fact of the matter is you are even encouraged to do it.The only consequence you do find is when you don't realize this, or choose to limit yourself to experience night.  You use a flashlight, a gaslamp etc and light yourself up like a beacon to the exploiters. I use the exploit so I cannot be exploited against and I am not alone. Is this intended? Maybe, the information I gather from the devs shows me they don't think it's an issue. I want to believe the reason they say it isn't an issue because they already have something planned that will solve it.It makes me not excited for accelerated time servers because I know I will be figuratively either forced to hop servers, forced to use the Gamma exploit, or intentionally wade through darkness and be killed by the exploiters.I want to experience night without exploits. If this issue didn't exist I know I would try out night servers more often, and I'm certain other people would too.What can really be done?

Who else thinks this is how world generation will work for ME multiplayer?I imagine you would set the size of the planet between 1km and 100km. All with luscious greenery and mountainous landscape.

34crlf	-12576	1430361712	MedievalEngineers	Planets and Medieval Engineers	I'm sure most of you have seen the dev post at Space Engineers about planets, 100km being the largest circumference of these planets. They even talked about these planets procedurally generating forests and mountains.Does this not sound like the future for ME?To put that into perspective, the surface area of a 100km planet would be 31000km!  I don't really care if a large planet is "necessary", I like to think that it opens limitless exploration possibilities.This makes me wonder how navigation will work.Even a 1km planet would still have 310km of surface area, which sounds like a perfect amount of land for many medieval engineers to settle into.This is a thought I had related to multiplayer and dedicated servers: I feel large planets would suit "hardcore" players best, while smaller planets would work best for PvP oriented people. However the varying blends of gameplay is huge.Now some reasons why a planet will be better in ME:1. There is no space above to load.-There won't be anything outside the planet to load, just the skybox2. Most of the center of the planet doesn't even need to be there.-If you dig deep enough, you start hitting bedrock. Not only that, structural integrity in the ground (eventually) will make it very hard when your tunnels are collapsing. My point is the game won't need to load it, so better performance.3. Night and day- The planet could be static but the skybox would rotate. That's all I have for now. What do you think?

Instead of hiring multiple people and paying them a wage, you could pay a flat rate or possibly rent the software.I imagine you would need to buy multiple AI's to maintain various complex tasks, as one AI could not steer the ship and manage weapons.

Long story short, I loved it at first but grew to hate it. I was always by myself and anxious all the time. I just stopped caring, did the minimum I could.  I went from 26 to 9 hours one week, so I called my boss and quit.Even now, people who recognize me at my new job say "Hey, ice cream shop!" Or "Hey, why aren't you making ice cream?"When this happens, I instantly shut down. I don't want to talk to anyone anymore. I tell them it was a toxic environment, then hope they move off the subject. I can barely look them in the eye.Every job has made me feel anxious and alone, this new job included.Last week I had over 20 hours, now I have 9. I go from four days a week to two. I just feel whirlwinds of anxiety because of it. I thought I would be able to save.I tell my fiance this and she tells me to get a different job, or go back to school.I tell her that any job I get will be the same as all my other jobs, stress-inducing nightmares, and that I can't afford to go to school. I just can't. I told her I don't want advice, I just want a shoulder to cry on.I just have no options and no experience, I just want to die so I can stop stressing and stop hating myself every day

m6o1n	-12580	1320879220	atheism	What is r/atheism opinion about pope John Paul II?	Hi there, r/atheism!First, I'd like to say that since I joined reddit community r/atheism is one of my favourite subreddits. I'd like to know your opinion about pope John Paul II. I'm asking because I'm polish (John Paul II was born and raised in Poland, he was born as Karol Wojtyła) and it's very difficult to find objective opinion about him in the Polish literature/press/media. He is often (about 95% of the time) called 'a great man', 'an authority to follow', but there are also more critical voices. To be honest, questioning John Paul's II authority in Poland can be seem as the same as questioning Holocaust, which may be because of his role in getting rid of Communism (am I supposed to write this in capital letters?) in Poland.So, what's your opinion about him, r/atheism?PS. I sincerely apologise for any grammatical mistakes, English isn't my first language.

urd0d	-12580	1339149126	asoiaf	(Spoiler ALL) Bran the Builder	Hi guys!During my ASOS reread I had this crazy thought. At the end of ADWD we (the readers) know that Bran is going to start his Jedi-style training in order to become an ultimate greenseer who can travel in time (sort of) and is most likely a Merling. But.. what if.. Bran IS Brandon The Builder? Could it be possible that Bran somehow builds The Wall? Think about it (wear your tinfoil hat prior to thinking) - I don't honestly believe that The Wall was built during one lifetime using ordinary building methods. But if Bran will be able to travel through time he might as well go back in time and using ancient tree magic protect The Realm against Others. That would justify GRMM making Bran go north in the first place.What does /r/asoiaf think about that? 
ut4o1	-12580	1339248401	atheism	To all of you who can't stand atheist-christian relationships.	I'm quite sure that this thread will be downvoted into oblivion, but honestly I don't care. Bear in mind that I'm not an English native speaker so there may be some grammar errors involved - beware!Guys, I think that we need to talk. I always thought that /r/atheism is nearly a haven of free-thinkers, tolerant to other people thoughts/believes etc. If you choose not to respect what someone believes in that is your problem and you are fully entitled to do so. But if you do not respect the person then well.. we have a bit of a problem, don't we?I've recently stumbled upon one of the threads about relationships on /r/atheism (I can't find the thread right now, maybe I'll edit my post later) and I must say that I was infuriated by the comments. Do you guys SERIOUSLY refuse somebody just because he/she is a believer? I am a 22 year old atheist from Poland, and my girlfriend (20) is very religious. She goes to church every week, confesses her sins, etc. But we just don't talk about it. I am in love with HER not her beliefs, her Bible, her God and she doesn't love me for the fact that I can't believe in any deity. Why do you keep insisting that one can't have a decent relationship with somebody who is religious? Most of you are afraid of not being accepted in society because of your atheism, and some of you are even being afraid simply because they are atheists (yeah, I'm talking about you Bible Belt folks). So why in the name of Holy Flying Spaghetti Monster do you refuse somebody just because they are different? Practice what you preach, please.Thank you, and have an amazing day!

vvkc8	-12580	1341144547	asoiaf	(Spoiler ALL) Does anyone else share the opinion that the TV series will end after season 5?	During my voyage through this subreddit I noticed that awful lot of readers seems to think that the TV series will last forever. In my opinion that is not exactly true.Let's face it - seasons 3&amp;4 which cover the most action-packed part of the story will be extremely entertaining to watch. But after season 4 there is time for season 5 which in my opinion will consist of events of the first half of AFFC&amp;ADWD and well.. nothing really happens in the first half of those books. We (as book readers) are capable of enduring through 2 filler books which sole purpose is to set up the scheme for AWOW but I'm quite sure that the fans of TV series won't share our love for ASOIAF after boring season 5 (especially if it is preceded by seasons covering events of ASOS).Just wanted to share some thoughts with you. Bear in mind that I am not an english native speaker and there may be some grammar errors involved.

zc9ux	-12580	1346774554	AskReddit	Reddit, how do you deal with your girlfriend's/boyfriend's friendzone'd friend?	There are threads all the time about how it feels to be friendzone'd, how do you escape friendzone etc. but my situation is quite different.Since May 13th I am in relationship with the most amazing girl ever and words cannot describe how I am grateful to the Universe that I met her. The same cannot be said for her friend, let's call him 'Mike'.Mike is my girlfriend's best friend's brother and has been in love with her since 2008, maybe even earlier. During all those years she asked him repeatedly whether they are only 'friends' - he said yes each time, which made my girlfriend sure of the fact that she can trust him. After she broke up with her last boyfriend around January this year he finally told her about his feelings. Basically, he said that he has always loved her and he couldn't wait until she and her ex-boyfriend finally break up (note: they have been each other for over 3 years and she wasn't exactly happy about being single). She was quite devastated at this point because she realised that he was her friend only because he wanted her (and well.. to do diggidy-do with her).Nowadays they are best friends again and not that I was jealous of the guy (because I do trust my girlfriend) but I'm not exactly comfortable with the idea that he is waiting until we break up to try to get her once more (not to mention the fact that they used to talk about her last relationship and he urged her to break up with her ex).Any advice?PS. I'm deeply sorry for any grammatical errors involved - English is not my first language.EDIT: I'd also like you to share your own personal stories, this could be interesting.

I own a lot of magazines and books about wristwatches. im reading them almost weekly because i saw a new watch on somebodys wrist and like to campare it to watches i know, or just to find out more about it.when i buy a watch i compare it for month with competitors before i actually buy it (for example omega speedmaster vs. tag heuer carrera - what a tough decision). there should be an "online-tool" that helps.The smartphone-webside im talking about is "www.versus.com". you may know it. if not, check it out for a moment. you choose two objects. it makes an easy comparison possible and you get a feeling the size.i would definitely start a project to build up a page like "versus-for-watches.com" but i need help. im not a programmer. im more into (online)-marketing and project-management. Who likes the idea, has some usefull skills and likes to team-up with me?i already have a fulltime job. So this should be more like a hobby, or weekend project.i believe that ideas should be free. so if you think you should steal the idea and do it by yourself. i wish you all the best.

It was so disturbing, i was not able to watch the hole episode. I like to finish what i started 15 years ago. Can you experts help me find the episode, please.It was about a dude in high security prison. He was about to be released in some more weeks. Mulder found the inmate's fingerprints on the outside of the cell-door and tryes to convince everyone to keep the inmate locked in. the finger prints were stratched. The dude was able to transform, or stratch his body every 10 or 15 years. He becomes some kind of creep, or monster.I remember Scully and, or Mulder being crawling through an airshaft/air conditioner and the creep follows/hunts them.On that point i had to turn the tv off and sleep with a knife next to my bed. (lol)please help me find it.thx

3abuzf	-12611	1434661100	halo	how many people actually like thruster pack and sprint	sprinting and thruster pack have been a large controversy in a halo. it seems as though it has split the community and i was curious to just how many people actually want sprint and thruster vs those who dont. honestly im a fan of sprinting and thruster pack in halo 5. i think it helps evolve the series and in my opinion it fits well and is a positive addition to the halo 5 gameplay. to me it feels like it belongs especially with the way the maps play. i have been playing halo since the beginning and have loved every single one (except 4, halo 4 was some trash). halo 3 was by far one of the best for me but honestly it cant just stay the same forever. it does grow stale. take CoD for example. people got mad that even though they had created the perfect formula for THEIR game, they had not changed much and for the most part every iteration after mw1 was just a reskinned cod.when the mcc came out i picked it up during christmas and i quickly grew bored of it because i had already played the shit out of those games and i wanted something new. the nostalgia just was not enough to keep me playing anymore. halo needed to evolve. this of course is just my opinion. with this all being said can anyone confidently tell me what amount of people like or dislike sprint and thruster pack?

Next to Bocas del Toro for some drinking and Scuba Diving. Then back to Panama City where I'll catch a train along the canal to Colon. Colon sounds like a shit hole so I'm planning on leaving straight away for Portobelo for a bit beach relaxation to end my trip. I'm also considering stopping in El Valle de Anton if I've time to check out El Chorro Macho waterfall.My question is, are there any cools spots in Panama that I'm overlooking, or places I've mentioned that could be skipped? Is El Chorro Macho worth seeing? I'd also like to hit a small beach town on the Pacific coast, but haven't come across any in my research, does anyone know of a fun one?

From memory it went something like: 1. Boil borccoli and pasta then remove from pot2. Save one cup of the pasta/broccoli water3. Fry a bit of garlic in olive oil in the pot4. Return broccoli and pasta to the pot5. Cook at low temperature, throwing in tons of parmesan, black pepper, chilli flakes and the pasta/brocolli water.That's roughly it but I tried making it the other day and it didn't turn out as well as it had previously.

1jvi70	-12613	1375870745	FantasyPL	Wilfried Zaha	At 6.5m, Zaha could provide cheap access to the Man Utd midfield and in an attacking role, making him a bargain. But I have concerns:* Is he good enough for the PL? I only saw a handful of games last year that he played in, don't really follow the Championship too closely. From what I saw of him he looked great but many players look good in the Championship and can't make the step up  * Has he been involved much in Man Utd's preseason games and if so how has he fared?* Most importantly: Is he going to start? Nani and Valencia both had relatively poor seasons last year. Man Utd haven't been linked with the signing of any more wingers that I've heard. I don't think Cleverly and Kagawa quite play the same position to be his direct competitionSo please tell me your thoughts on Wilfried Zaha.

2q81ki	-12626	1419376625	relationships	I'm [23 M] thinking about breaking things off with the girl I'm dating [20 F] am I wrong about her?	So we've been dating about 2 months now, I really liked her at first but I asked her where tings were going a few weeks ago and she said she didn't want to define the relationship and she wanted to take things slow but that I was the only guy she was going to talk to or anything like that (has been verified and I trust her there). Fast forward 2 weeks to the end of the semester and she didn't even make an effort to see me before we left on that friday after exams. We hadn't seen each other since the Sunday then. That kind of hurt my feelings as I expressed I really did want to see her. She said she was busy with her roommates. She goes on a week long trip and texts me a day after she gets back. Says she's told her friends at home about me and they think I'm cute and she's told her family about me too. As you can tell this seems to be counter to how shes acted. Then I asked her if she wanted to go to a Thunder (NBA) game on the 23rd and she said "probably not, I don't really like basketball"point is, I'm probably going to break things off because it feels like she's been really selfish and she honestly doesn't give a damn about me and if I emotionally invest any more I feel like I'll just be setting myself up to be taken advantage of. ---   **tl;dr**:  Should I break up with someone who says they want to date me and has already told friends/family about me but her actions don't reflect that? Or should I give it some more time and I'm just trying to move too fast?

Starting to see some definition in chest and arms I want to add abs and legs and forearms but I really only want to work out for 35/40 mins max per day. I've seen some of the workout routines on r/fitness and r/bodyweight or whatever its called but I'm really only looking to do 4 exercises max. No weights so I can just do them in my apartment. I was thinking- 1. Ab wheel - every day. 2. Pushups - max number at once (right now 65) and then declining sets after (10/5 slow) - every other day3. Pullups - get a pull up bar (no idea how many) - off setting days from pushups4. Squats/pistol squats/calf raises - every other dayok so thats 5 but does that look good to you all? TIA! Just trying to get healthy and look good doing it. Really trying to cut out driving to a gym and socializing with people lolTldr; just read the title.

2s54ly	-12626	1421045132	smashbros	up smash is the new down smash	I was realllllly good at n64 smash. I played some melee. Then I bought SSB4 and its a totally different game....not worse it just seems like everything is backwards from 64 and melee. Most characters have a good up smash. Recovering is easySpiking is a LOT harder (least favorite thing)You should be hyper aggressive in 64 version. In ssb4 its all about defense.basically you have to re-learn the game. I like it though.

2sd244	-12626	1421206786	smashbros	Put some time in experimenting to find a main	I've played every character and all the stages and watched a lot of pro play. Really, overall, I think Diddy is the strongest all around but I figured I'd write out my thoughts for some of you who weren't pros who were wondering what you might like to play. Pit - I started out him with after testing everyone. His attacks are very fast and his side B is easy to follow up with, the biggest problem with him is that his follow ups are very weak and you have to get someone to a pretty high percent to knock them out. His recovery is epic, still, I'd place him at mid tier. Fox - Really really really liked him in Melee, hes not terrible in SSB4 but the fact that people recover so much faster now makes it really hard/impossible to string combos together. I played maybe 20 games with him, which isn't a huge sample size but he just felt really weak to me. Lower tier. Ike - Loved Ike at first.....vs NPCs. Vs people Ike isn't so hot. His grabs are strong and he punishes hard. But he also gets punished quite hard in return. He really plays like Bowser with a sword. Slow, heavy hitter. Never going to win vs very skilled competition. Love his side B though. Upper tier until you start playing a good link/marth/lucina Lucina - A marth clone but weaker. A lot of discussion out there on this so I'll leave it at that. Mid tier. Kirby - Ok, kirby is quite light in this game, but he hits hard and his brick is much more powerful than it used to be. Get decent at using it, because recovery times are so much better I'd suggest using down B in every matchup except vs diddy. I wouldn't even pick kirby into diddy. Otherwise Kirby is very very strong imo. Well rounded, can recover from anywhere on the screen. The fact that a hit with brick will kill at low (ish) percents and his A smash has decent kill potential as well makes him dangerous. I can go further into detail if requested but this is getting long already. Upper tier. Marth - This is who I wound up picking as my main for now. I think he's outclassed by diddy but the matchup isn't so bad. Still working out side b for recovery. He punishes hard, he has great range and getting good at air tippers will net you high percent opponents quite fast. Marth is weaker than his Melee counterpart but I still think he will see a lot of competitive play as you can set up a wall against most opponents and punish them if they get close. He has good speed for his weight as well, recovery is mediocre though, careful if you're trying to edge guard, I don't even try tbh. Upper tier. Falco - a worse fox clone. Didn't play him much though, I just didn't like him. idk tierThat's all I have off the top of my head! I know this isn't close to complete but it would be cool if you guys want to leave some feedback or add to/edit this list! I'd like to get a much more comprehensive list of tiers from just the reddit community for smash 4! Thanks for reading!
2sx0d8	-12626	1421654287	dating_advice	I'm 23M, just getting out of college.	Honestly, I've dated a fair amount, I've done the whole thing picking up girls at bars/coffee places/etc and I HATE it. I just want to put myself in a position to meet someone organically. I feel that I'm ready for a real relationship but no really good options have presented themselves. Is there a way for a post grad to meet girls (no bars/clubs please) or should I just forget about it and move on?

2t12at	-12626	1421738176	offmychest	I finally dated a girl who met my standards for looks....and I hated it.	I met this girl, thought she was maybe the most beautiful person I'd ever seen. Somehow convinced her to go out with me.Over the course of a month she managed to destroy my self confidence. She barely seemed to care about me at all, yet we spent a whole weekend (like 72 hours) together and loved it. Anyway, long story short she was really an ass to me and didn't seem to want to communicate her feelings or talk to me at all, I was doing backflips in my head the whole time and finally I just had to break things off because she was driving me insane.This whole experience really crushed my perception of women. I thought, if I just find a pretty girl that I have a lot in common with everything will work out....but it didn't, and her personality was really awful looking back. Now I'm a bit lost because it feels like I'll never find someone who is that good looking to me and is capable of a serious relationship. It seems like if they reach beyond a certain point of being attractive they have guys calling them all the time etc and just don't appreciate being with one person and I hate that. a lot. Because it's taken me so long to get to a healthy place where I'm mentally (mature) ready for a real relationship. Feels good to get it out.

I'm Bronze 1 80 lp and I've gotten up to silver 4 I think I'm going to play olaf top and jg on my way out.Anyway, I could use some tips if you have any or I'd just love to hear your general thoughts on the champion and how you like to play him.I play 21/9/0 with armor pen, health per level, mr, and life steal quints. Build path is usually either chilling smite red item in jg or I go for ghost blade/bork depending on matchup top.usually I build bork/ghostblade, then go tank items like SV or frozen heart, and some HP in there.I've tried maxing every different skill i think it just depends on what you want to do, 1v1 duel? max your lifestealing w. Poke top? Max q, assasin 2v2 ganks? max e. Also Olaf can early drag quite well so I try to pink drag and grab that sometimes.

I hit silver 4 in preseason this year but that's about it. Anyway, summoner school has been a HUGE help. Especially the recent, very detailed vayne posts. I play a decent amount of vayne both top and adc and the post about builds was hugely helpful to me. My winrate with vayne went from 40% to 62% and my kda went from 2.0 to 3.0. Also the posts on how to position as a damage dealer in teamfights has been awesome. I'm 2 games away from winning my series into silver (1/0) and I think if I can keep playing at this level and dodging the troll games, even if it costs 4lp....I'll be able to get to mid silver, maaaaybe gold v by end of season! Anyway, yeah I guess the point is thanks, and also the more detailed posts have helped me a lot more than the "don't feed" type of posts. edit: for instance the last 2 vayne games I played I got a quadra and a triple respectively to end the games around 40 mins. I know if I hadn't know about target selection and positioning we'd have lost for sure. I see a lot of bronze adcs just stop dealing damage during fights or either run into the middle of the team. Having things in my mind like "use ghostblade to blow up their assassins" and "only use your q to go backwards unless you're 100% sure you're going to win going forward"

3cthuz	-12626	1436549039	offmychest	Had a horrible couple of days and the only way to fix it is to double down on my efforts	I thought the next couple of months would be easy and really fun, turns out it's just 3x harder than the last couple of months and I thought I was over the hill. Hill is just starting. Would like to cry and curl up in a ball, not going to. I'm going to get control of myself emotionally and do what needs to be done, because that's what being successful is about. Fuck this life, but I'm going to make it do what I want not the other way around.

2kc9z0	-12629	1414292386	offmychest	My Future.	Lately I've been thinking a lot about my future. Ever since I was like 14 years old I was 100% sure I was going to follow a specific plan for my life. I would go to college, go to med school, and become a surgeon. I've been doing an internship at a hospital for the past couple of weeks and have been in the O.R., been around surgeons, med students, etc. Every night I dread waking up and going to the hospital in the morning, I hate the way some surgeons treat their staff, and I dislike being there. Of course, there are times where I see or do something and think, "You know what, I could do this every day of my life", but not often.       It's just I grew up telling everyone I met that I was going to become this accomplished, successful surgeon, and now...I really don't know if that's what I want to do with my life. I don't want to let anyone down, and I know this seems stupid, but I don't want people to think, "Oh, corpuscallosum8 is weak and couldn't do it." I know it shouldn't matter, but I can't stop myself from thinking about what others will think if I choose to change my career pathway. I've just become very disillusioned with reality and am not enjoying the majority of my time at the hospital.      I'm also a woman, I want a family one day and I want to give all of my time and energy to my children. My mom was a stay at home mom, and was there for me 100% of the time. I came home to home-cooked warm meals, had clean clothes, and had someone to talk to every single day. I really am grateful for her involvement in my life and really want to be able to give that to my children one day. I don't want them to come to an empty house, or not be able to come home from school when their sick because I am working. On the other hand, I don't want to go through 15+ years of school just to stay at home! Agh. I just have no idea what to do with my life anymore.      Honestly, my dream future would be taking pictures for National Geographic and then becoming a stay at home mom when I have children.     Man, does it feel good to get all of that off my chest. I apologize for the length of it all, and appreciate any advice or similar experiences. I seriously feel better just letting this all out, so if no one comments, that's okay too. :)

2m11pt	-12629	1415756812	offmychest	Having a crisis.	I don't know what happened to me. Last year, I was so excited to get into my field of work and so excited about this job. Now that I'm actually completing my internship, I realize how much I dislike this field of work. You are the low man on the totem pole, everything is your fault regardless of the circumstances, it's stressful and I just don't enjoy it. The pay is okay, but if the hours suck, the atmosphere sucks, and I hate it, who cares about pay. I want to be able to wake up and see the sun rise and not hate my life every time I remember that I have work the next day. Does everyone hate working? I just want to enjoy my life, as stupid and cliche as it sounds, I'm only going to be this age once in my life. I want to enjoy and experience and learn and make friends and go on dates! I don't want to be stuck working and hating my life! That's not a way to live. I want to study something that I love, but in this world we have to study things that make money. On my home today, I thought about how I would have the flu and be puking than to go to work tomorrow. Does everyone think that about working? Are there people out there that like going to work? Or at least, they don't hate it? I just can't wait until next spring when I begin my studies again, so that I can branch out and find something I actually like doing. I just want to be happy and look forward to what I do everyday.

He is way into anime, online gaming, and has a lot of issues with self confidence and his family. He isn't going to college (education is huge to me) He isn't my "type" at all but I can't stop thinking about him. I've even been having dreams about him, in the which him and I are dating. Anyone else have anything similar happen to them?
2nvlfb	-12629	1417383781	getdisciplined	[Need Advice] How to productively fill my evenings?	Hi everyone, in my life right now I lack discipline, hence why I am here. Each day I wake up at 4:30am to go to work and don't get home until about 3:50pm. Where I work, you can't ever really zone out or have downtime. I have to be focused 100% of the time (besides lunch obviously). This takes a huge mental toll on me, and by the time I get home, I am so mentally spent I have no motivation to do anything but sit on the couch and watch t.v. or reddit. Every now and then I have energy to write, paint, or do something other than participating in passive entertainment, but rarely. Do you guys have any tips for how I can ease myself into productive activities after a day that has left me mentally exhausted?I am grateful to hear any advice!!!

2o2hz5	-12629	1417545784	latterdaysaints	Tender mercies	I've been having a terribly rough time in my life. I'm mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually exhausted. I'm doing some training for a job and I just hate every second. I had a mental breakdown yesterday and cried and cried and cried. I asked for a blessing and felt peace, but was still sad and tired and worried. I've spent the last few weeks saying "I just wish I could at least see the sun rise", since I start my job early and never get to see it. Seeing the sun rise is just one thing I wish I could do every day. After many prayers, mostly silent ones, a tender mercy happened. This morning it just happened to be that I was in the right place at the right time.I saw the sun rise out of a beautiful window. I had enough time this morning and was in the right place to see this happen. This is so so so rare. The way it happened, and because it happened at this trying time in my life, I knew it was God's hand in my life. I knew it was a tender mercy. It brightened my day, literally. I felt peace in my heart and knew that I would be able to get through this.Tender mercies are real, God does hear your prayers, and I hope you have been able to see God's hand in your life. I'd love to hear some if anyone is willing to share!!Edit-some words

2t4j3g	-12629	1421807373	offmychest	I'm not going to be a doctor.	Since 9th grade I've had a plan to become a surgeon. I had the next 15 years of my life planned out. I was going to do service, leadership, volunteer work, and major in something to help me get into med school. I was going to do so many extracurriculars and job shadows and internships. I was so ready for a life of prestige and wealth. I was set on this dream and was willing to give up my time, money, and life to accomplish my goals.Or so I thought. I've changed so much in the past years and I realize that I'm under no obligation to have the same goal now that I did when I was in middle school. After working in the O.R., I realized I don't like surgery as much as I thought I would, I value my time and don't want to spend every minute in a hospital. I hated the environment and couldn't wait to leave every day, regardless of the facility I was at. And that's okay. I won't be a doctor anymore, and that is OKAY. I'm going to finish my bachelors and maybe go to grad school in a subject I enjoy. Maybe engineering, maybe astronomy, maybe anthropology, who knows? I put so much pressure on myself to be perfect 100% of the time because I had to get into med school and I HAD to become a surgeon.I don't HAVE to do anything. And that's OKAY. :) Edit-a word

2y3epl	-12629	1425608598	offmychest	In eighty years, it probably won't matter.	My head feels cloudy. I feel like I can't focus on anything at once. I don't understand anything in my math or chemistry classes, and will probably fail the two tests I have next week because I keep stressing myself out. I can't focus on studying, I can't learn the material because I'm so overwhelmed that I won't be able to learn it in time for Monday and Tuesday. I can't think straight, I can't think at all. I don't know what to do. If I fail these two tests, I will most likely lose my scholarship because my GPA will drop. But I can't learn the material and I feel like I'm drowning in anxiety.School makes me want to end my existence on this Earth sometimes, and that is so messed up. Why does college have to be like that? Actually, it's probably just me. Also, I'm lonely. Come join my self-loathing party. There will be lots of complaining and crying. Bring a treat to share. FJDKSLA;FJDKSLAFJKDLSA;JFDKLSA;JFDKLAS;JFKDSLA;JFKDLA;JFKDLAS;JFKDLSA;JFKDLSAJFKDLS;AJFKDSLA;JFKDLAS;JFDKLSA;JFK;LSJRIEWOPQURIEOFUEIWOQJFIOPAEJFISAOJFKLAJKLDFJSAJFWIEJAFOAJFEIOWAJPFIEOAJFKDLSA;JFKDLAS;JFKLAS;JFSKJFKDA;JThat made me feel a bit better. I should just delete this, but I feel like submitting it will somehow take away some of the stress and throw it through the internet. FOCUS FOCUS FOCUS FOCUS. Stop moving your feet, stop blinking so rapidly, stop grinding your teeth. I want to drop out of college and go be a nomad. Go take photographs of beautiful places and people, or write a novel. I've always loved writing, literature, photography, art. So it's not really a surprise I'm struggling at chemistry and math. It's always taken me forever to get it. I'm not the person who can spit out formulas and understand concepts quickly and easily. It takes me days to figure things out, and even then I'm barely scraping by. Crap, it's 7pm already. Should I pull an allnighter? Should I say screw it, and go to bed? I don't care and I care too much at the same time. I'm depressed, anxious, and lonely, but so is everyone else it seems. I don't want to be a scientist or a doctor or an engineer, regardless of what is expected of me. I want to write, to create, to dream, to read, to photograph, to inspire and be inspired. Chemical formulas and trigonometry do not invigorate me. Novels and beautiful photographs do. Then why am I taking these classes? Oh. Right. A degree in the humanities doesn't get you anywhere. You won't make money doing that. You won't be respected doing that. You won't find a job doing that. My teeth hurt. I've been grinding them together slowly, because I can't seem to stop clenching my jaw. This has given me a headache, along with lack of sleep and dried out contacts. My shoulders are stiff, my breathing shallow. Is this living? Because it feels like I'm dying. Well, that was a bit melodramatic. But it's how I feel, nevertheless. I feel a bit better writing this all out. It makes me laugh inwardly to think about how some may react to this monster of a vent. "It could be worse" you might say. "It's not that bad", "pull yourself together", "just work hard", "if you put your mind to it you can do it", "wow the pity party is alive and well".All these reactions may be correct. But I don't care. I don't want to work hard at this. I want to give up. I want to forgo the preset plans my family has set and follow my own path. It's a very cliche thing to say, as so many before me have said the same thing. Does that make it so wrong, though? Just because it's cliche, is it wrong to want that? I'm rambling. The clouds in my mind are gathering, swirling in a storm of stress. I know the sun is there, but I can't see it, can't feel it. The noise and lights are too loud, all I can focus on is how unfocused I feel. Okay. I think I can start studying now. Maybe. I'll give it a shot. After all, I just need to get through this semester. Next semester, I'm going to take a writing class. Maybe even a photography class. Why not? Maybe I'll be happier and healthier. I just need to make it through these next few weeks. I've been through worse, I can do it. After all, does it matter? In eighty years, when I'm given back to the Earth, will the stars mourn? Will the mountains that watch over  human settlements care that I failed my chemistry test and math test, freshman year of college? Will the generations after me suffer because I lost my scholarship and dropped my GPA? Probably not. That makes me feel better. And worse. Wow, this is quite long. If you read all of this, or even skimmed it, I applaud you. I won't even read this after writing it. It would be like playing with hair I've already cut from my head. Well, I'll give this a shot. Because it won't matter in eighty years, when my body is covered in wrinkles and my eyes are cloudy, I won't even remember failing those tests. Maybe I will, and look back at them fondly. "I was so worried," I'll tell my grandkids, "but in the end, it all worked out." They'll laugh and tell me I'm old, and I'll laugh and tell them they're right. Well, I've said all I can say, so goodnight.

Before this, I used to be the student who studied all the time, had a great GPA, and who others looked up to as a good student.Now? Now I BS all of my assignments, skip class, can't bring myself to ask for help, and have no desire to do homework or even to do well on tests. I could lose my scholarship, and the thing is, I don't even care. Then at least I won't have to take 12 credits, just like 6 or so. I have finals coming up and my anxiety is at an all time high, problem is, so is my depression. Anxiety + depression = excessive worry but not being able to do anything about it but post on offmychest. All in all, I hate this semester and no matter what I tell myself, I can't bring myself to do homework or care about my grades enough to work hard. Screw all of this.

Update 1-A Facebook friend commented on my status saying "I saw it get hit to but I have no idea what it was?" So I'm not as crazy as I feel, yet we have no idea still about what the flaming UFO was. Sent an inquiry to KSL, checking twitter and breaking news websites for  aircraft information. Update 2- Friend suggested it could have been a small plane or helicopter?? Does anyone know how well small planes can withstand lightning strikes? Still nothing from local news, hoping for the best. If anyone has any idea of what we saw, let me know. I really hope no one was hurt, and what we saw was not a blazing aircraft. Final Update for the night- Someone suggested on fb that it could have been a drone. I don't understand who would think it was a good idea to fly a drone through a thunderstorm, BUT it's an answer that makes sense and has no loss of human life. That's the answer I'm going with. Hope that it's what actually happened.

s1z41	-12668	1334028381	self	Reddit, I need opinions and advice, please help!	When I was 13 my parents decided to move our family from the UK to Australia. Now I'm 18 and I think I want to move back and attend university in Leeds. My parents are notorious for not taking decisions like these very well and it will usually result in fighting and allegations of selfishness. Reddit, how do I break this idea to them and get them to help me finalize my idea? **Context**We moved from Leeds a few years back and now live in Brisbane QLD, which, without sounding like I'm berating the state or country, seems a little... stagnant, I suppose. There doesn't seem to be that big a drive for success, and the idea of "rooting for the underdog" has created an atmosphere where people who don't try are glorified above those who attempt to be successful.**what I mean is,** I'm ashamed to tell people that I go to university because I'm then made to feel bad about it.Moving here as a great idea for my parents as they have found their places in life (they have jobs and security and get to come home to a holiday lifestyle everyday), but I haven't got that. In an overly dramatic way, it feels like dying and going to heaven before having fully lived your life. I need those real experiences and I feel I need to go back there to experience them. Please help Reddit!

So now I am choosing between the peak and shawl lapel - leaning toward shawl but I'm not sure. I saw somewhere that Indochino can't do a full satin shawl lapel, it only has a strip like the one in their photo. I've asked for confirmation on this and photos of the peak and shawl lapels if possible.For the rest, I was thinking no vent jacket, 1 button, and no pleat pants. As far as the tuxedo shirt goes, I was thinking just a plain white one with a normal collar not the tuxedo collar even though I'd be getting a bow tie. Lastly, I'm assuming that french cuffs are the norm and suspenders as well?Here's the direct link. http://www.indochino.com/product/essential-midnight-blue-tuxedo

It has the "manual opener" feature, so when the power is off, the valve opens.The actuator motor itself is spinning when I take a cover off. I move the slider between "Auto" and "Man Open" and nothing changes. As soon as the power is removed, it moves to the "open" state (a spring pulls it open)How do I know which part I need to replace? The actuator motor I'm assuming?Also, can I just disconnect the power from the motor and let it be "open" all the time while the system is on? (at least then I'd get heat while I figure out what to do)

My condo is only assessed at about 265k and I bought it a couple years ago for 335k (I know tax assessment isn't the same as market price). 2 years ago there was a previous special assessment which was supposed to be 1/3 of the total work and which was $8,500 which I've already paid.Any advice would be greatly appreciated.I'm in Alberta, Canada in case that helps / changes responses

On the label it says "Source: 1Ph, 115V/60Hz" and "1110W/10.2A".I had it plugged into an outlet on a circuit with other things running with no issues for several summers. All of a sudden it started tripping the breaker (15A breaker). I temporarily plugged it into a different outlet (using a 20A outdoor extension cord made for block heaters, "yellow jacket") on a circuit where nothing else was in use, same issue (15A breaker).I have a watt meter, not just how accurate they are, but here's weird part: the watt usage just climbs from 1000 all the way up to ~1800 where it trips the breaker. Takes about 2-4 minutes.Any ideas? Something in the A/C unit that broke that could cause this? Thanks

I noticed it had begun to repeatedly trip the breaker and after trying a circuit with nothing else on it and attaching a watt monitor I noticed the Watts used simply increased to 1800W and then tripped (15A circuit, Canada).Reading online leads me to believe it is a bad capacitor and I should replace it. Is that a hard job? And any tips on where to order once would be great, I've had no luck with google.Last, any other things to try - some people said to simply "clean" it but I'm not sure exactly what I should be cleaning or how.Thanks

2sgh14	-12691	1421278815	FIFA	Why should I buy 15K packs? (aka Why is my math wrong, because I'm sure it is)	I did a quick calculation on the few packs that have been out recently to try to figure out if bigger truly was better.   I tried to figure out the chance of getting at least one rare gold player in a pack using a guess on how many players usually show up in those packs (with exception of the 25K packs that were out today which was all players)   http://i.imgur.com/eLPmlch.png   Here's the formula:   (# rare cards / total cards in a pack) x (# gold cards / total cards in a pack) x (# of players / total cards in a pack)Now, I think that is right. So, it shows that a 5K pack you have a ~2% chance of getting a gold rare player and for 7.5K and 15K you have ~6%.   What I'm not sure of is where I took that % and multiplied it by a ratio to get the % chance per # of coins spent (the last line of the the chart image): i.e. 6% x (15/7.5) = that same % over 2 packs, as in if you have a 6% chance in one 15K pack OR a 6% chance in a 7.5K pack PLUS 6% chance in a 7.5K pack. I'm not sure if that is correct or not.Also, obviously the guessing at the "average" number of player cards that show up in any pack is a guess, but for 7.5K I've never seen less than 2 or more than 6 and most of the time it is 3 or 4 so I picked 3.5. This is anecdotal and only EA knows the ranges and probabilities for sure but it is better than nothing. Any thoughts would be great (I'm bored at work and wondering what to spend my coins on).

Hi,I'm looking at getting Air Conditioning installed in my condo which is about 950 sq ft split over 2 floors (roughly equally). I was looking at getting a ductless system (mini split, ductless split) where there is a box outside and then one or more units inside.In my case I wanted to have a 2 zone (one per floor) system with a heat pump so the units can provide cool or hot air all year round (I live in Canada where the temp varies from -40 C to +35 C).So, this company has told me I should have a "2 ton" system (approx 24,000 BTU) or "1 ton per zone".He quoted me that this would cost roughly $9000+GST (5% tax) for the units and installation. I'm just wondering if this seems in the ballpark or way out of whack or if he's trying to sell me something I don't need. I know that before having my windows replaced I was using a 12000 BTU window unit from Costco and it easily could make my top floor like a meat locker.I'm happy to pay a premium for good parts from a reputable company and a professional install and service, but I have no frame of reference as most other companies wouldn't even come in and quote for other people in my building so I've called these guys first as other people used them (but only got a 1 zone AC only - no heat pump).Thanks for reading.

I can create a whitelist for which are "good".Once this is complete, I need to make one new sheet per file extension, and copy over the first 4 columns plus the valid path into the 5th column.

I've been a Redditor for almost three years now, and one of the things I love best about this place is how every here rallys around those in need of help.  Well it is my turn, and I could use your advice.Two days ago I went on Craigslist looking for tickets for the Clippers/Bulls game.  A guy was offering some pretty choice seats at a good price, so I emailed him.  He called me back and we set up a meeting spot at a bank around Laurel &amp; Ventura.  Was about 6pm when this all went down. I get out of my car and find the guy in front of a bank.  This dude was super skinny, pale white skin, and tall as hell... about 6'6".  I grilled him a little bit about the tickets, and he said I could call Ticketmaster and read off the ticket # to insure the order was valid.  So I did, read the number, and all seemed kosher.

I did look at his phone and notice it was a blackberry torch, which indicated to me it was a permanent phone (not a disposable).So we part ways.

This dude probably racked off 10 duplicate tickets and screwed more people than me.Anyway, I'm friggin livid and I want to get back at this bastard.  All I have is a reverse cell lookup, which got me this address (4570 Van Nuys Blvd #3517) which I discovered is a mailbox depot, and (kind of humorously) he used the names Julie and John Fogerty... clearly fakes.So bottom line... given everything I have relayed... what is the best course of action?

fevba	-12720	1296780031	AskReddit	REDDIT I need your help... I just got scammed buying tickets off Craigslist!	Hey gang... I've been a Redditor for almost three years now, and one of the things I love best about this place is how every here rallys around those in need of help. Well it is my turn, and I could use your advice.Two days ago I went on Craigslist looking for tickets for the Clippers/Bulls game. A guy was offering some pretty choice seats at a good price, so I emailed him. He called me back and we set up a meeting spot at a bank around Laurel &amp; Ventura. Was about 6pm when this all went down. I get out of my car and find the guy in front of a bank. This dude was super skinny, pale white skin, and tall as hell... about 6'6". I grilled him a little bit about the tickets, and he said I could call Ticketmaster and read off the ticket # to insure the order was valid. So I did, read the number, and all seemed kosher. Now I asked him to see his driver's license, and he said he didn't have it on him. HUGE warning sign I should have taken to, and I'm killing myself for not being smarter. I did look at his phone and notice it was a blackberry torch, which indicated to me it was a permanent phone (not a disposable).So we part ways. Next night at the game, lo and behold, go up to the door and the ticket taker said the tickets had already been used. I had been duped!

All of our willing and fine male and female Redditors would submit their linked photos into a the comments thread and Redditors would vote initially on looks. I would then start a new thread where Redditors would be able to submit their questions for the 'interview round'. I would take the Top 10 most upvoted men and women and ask them the Top 10 most upvoted questions in random order. We would then vote on their responses and narrow the field to five. After, we would have them compete in a final round where the contestants would partake in either a cosplay, swimsuit, or outfit of their choice. The upvotes will be tallied and the first official Mr. and Miss Reddit 2011 will be crowned! Open to feedback on the format, but I think this will be fun... let me know your thoughts!

o70u0	-12720	1325965514	AskReddit	Does anyone else think that Reddit is, quite literally, making them dumber?  More inside...	I've been redditing for almost five years now (couple of them lurking), which equates to a unprecedented amount of useless information being crammed into my brain.  I'm currently in my early thirties, am (or at least I was) pretty smart (MBA, near perfect SAT, blah blah).  I have spent an average of two hours a day, EVERY day, on Reddit which equates to an ungodly amount of images and stories (the majority of them useless) which I am absorbing.So bottom line... over the last few months, I have felt like I have gotten dumber, in the sense it is taking me longer to recall information.  I feel like my cognitive pathways are so on overflow with all the information I digest, that accessing certain thoughts is like trying to find that one matching sock in a mega sized sock drawer.  My synapses are firing like they used two and, assuming this isn't the onset of alzheimers, I don't feel like this should be happening.  Until the invention of the internet, and furthermore Reddit, there was no means by which humans could absorb so much information, so fast, and so often.  This is literally a new frontier.  I've been concerned that after five years, I just discovered the equivalency of cigarettes causing cancer.  I am beyond hooked on Reddit, and Im worried it's not good for my health.Am I alone here?  Would welcome everyone's thoughts!

In one of them there has been this extremely cute girl that walks by me at the exact same time every day that I'm cutting a certain area. We usually make eye contact and smile or something along those lines. Eventually I ended up getting off my mower one day and I asked her out. SUCCESS! I get her number and all that and we go on a great date that same night. This happened yesterday. Now today, I'm working in the same area and I'm on a decently steep hill. As usual, she walks by and we make eye contact and smile, but this time I decided (stupidly) to take my hand off the throttle on the machine and wave to her. Right when I do this my mower hit a bump on the grass and the machine goes flying right into some rich old dude's fence...So... Because I'm an idiot, I now owe my company $3000 for a new deck on the mower, and the resident god-knows how much for his immaculate perfect fence that was probably worth a shitload of money as well.That was an expensive fucking wave. TL;DR I got distracted while on my mower and rammed a rich dude's fence/broke the machine and I now owe a couple thousand dollars.

We ended up not being able to find any so as a last minute decision we stopped at a headshop on our way out of town and grabbed some Salvia 20X. Both my friend and I have done salvia before. Previously I had a bowl and then had a laugh attack for 15 minutes. He has had a few visual trips in the past where he "went into another world". I wanted something like that to happen to me. So We first started with the salvia and we each had a bowl. I felt the normal salvia come up where you can feel it in your teeth and mouth then just an odd feeling around you. This went away and we were all a little underwhelmed. My friend had another bowl and he said that everything he was looking at turned into doubles and that I had two heads. Overall the first bit of our salvia use was okay!Then later the next day, we were planning on drinking a bit. However, we had no mix and wanted some. So everyone left to go get mix except for me and my friend from the beginning. He wanted to nap, so I just said fuck it and decided to take a bowl of salvia while everyone is gone. So I proceeded to go outside and fill up a larger bowl than normal of the salvia. I took my hit and held in the smoke as long as possible. As I exhaled I lied down on the couch that was out on the veranda I was smoking at. I stared at the ceiling and felt really warm. I closed my eyes and I started to feel a little uncomfortable so I opened them and tried to get up, as I did this The side of the couch started to move up with me and grew very tall. I felt it move up and grown taller until it started arching over and coming down. It came down at me and ate me. This sort of alerted me and I stood up and walked towards the door to get inside of the house. I looked back at the couch and felt an "evil" presence pulling me back into it. At this moment in time I thought to myself, "I now understand why some people would really freak out about this. But I know this isnt real and I'm just gonna go find my friend and talk about this."I feel if I wasnt so used to being in altered states of mind all the time, this would have been an awful experience. But yeah, that's it. Overall, I enjoy salvia its very nice and relaxing in low doses.TL;DR Tripped on Salvia, got eaten by a couch.&gt;EDIT: Spelling

For example,  a mirror that has been sitting for a very long ends up becoming like a carnival mirror and the bottom portion is thicker than the top. Now would it be possible, for a piece of glass in a table that is held up by its four corners,  for heavy items placed on the table to sink into the glass and leave an imprint?
39921a	-12724	1433906496	Drugs	Best or Scariest Paranoid Moment While High (On anything)	So I'm pretty sure one time when i first started smoking I got some laced stuff, or it was just really good and I was inexperienced. But either way, My friend and i smoked and proceeded to enter a movie theater to go see Cabin in the Woods. As we got into the theater, my friend pulls out cinnamon buns from his work (Worked at Cobs' Bread, fuck yeah) and we start to chow down like the high motherfuckers we were. As I was finishing up my bun, I noticed the person in front of us staring at us, likely because of how ravenous our eating was. I mean, I DEVOURED that cinnamon bun. Anyways, after I saw him staring I looked around and saw that everyone was staring at us. At this point my heart started racing, thinking that everyone knows we're stoned. Conveniently, right as I start to freak out, a security guard wearing a bright yellow jacket comes into the theater and I hear his radio go off. I instantly think that he's calling for backup in order to apprehend us. I tell my friend about what's going through my head and he started freaking out as well. We ended up deciding to leave the movie rather than take the chance of getting in trouble.Now this is where the paranoia cranks up a notch.We leave through the doors at the bottom of the theater. This exit leads us right across from the parking lot where my car is. As we head towards my car to leave I see a bald businessman in a suit with one of those old bluetooths in his ear with a wire going into his shirt from it. To me, at the time, it looked like what all the secrets agents wore in all the spy shows to keep in touch with each other. He then put the cuff of his shirt up to his mouth as if he were speaking into it and I look over to my friend and say "&lt;Friend's name&gt;, oh my god, that guy is a fucking cop." We both look at each other again and bolt in opposite directions. There was a superstore beside the theater that I ran behind and on the opposite side of the theater from where i went there was a chapters where my friend ran into. (I didn't know he went there and he didn't know I went where I did)So for about 30 mins or so, I'm freaking out trying to figure out what to do by myself. For some reason I didn't think to text my friend and keep in touch. After I started calming down a bit I tried to find him. I wandered around the strip mall and everything trying to find him, when all of the sudden my paranoia came back full force. I started freaking out again and thought that literally EVERYONE I saw was a cop. Every car that drove by I thought was looking at me. Because of this, I decided the best thing to do was to change my appearance. So I took off my jacket and held it and dumped the drink I had gotten. (Cause that would totally disguise me...) This ended up doing nothing overall to ease my anxiety and paranoia.At this point I was still freaking out and finally I decided that maybe my friend was in chapters. So I headed in that direction. On my way there the paranoia increased and increased as i got closer to the building. It got so bad that I thought that things and people started to look "too normal" so it couldn't actually be what it was. Every couple I saw just looked too perfect to be real. They had to be cops, or paid by cops to watch me. I ended up seeing a couple that was a gorgeous asian woman and a fairly short unattractive brown man. I couldn't believe what I was seeing as that was an odd combination of races to be together (Still high, remember, not racist bruh). I had it set in my mind that they HAD to be cops. So I went up to them and said, "I surrender..." and I put out my hands waiting to be cuffed. They gave a a weird look and kept walking. I was so confused, but I was almost at chapters. As i walked towards the doors, there were people there who opened both sets of doors for me to get into the building. Paranoid mind thinking they're leading me into a trap. I still proceeded to enter, where I see my friend with his back up against a bookshelf looking as sketched out as I am. I ran up to him and gave him a hug and we both breathed a sigh of relief to see each other again. We calmed ourselves down and read a few children stories to ease our minds. Then we finally chilled the fuck out.Headed back to the car and proceeded to head home for the rest of the day. TO this day we still look back on that day as the most intense paranoia we both have ever experienced. It was also one event that has brought us closer as friends and we laugh our asses off about it now.Tl;dr: Smoke some weed that may or may not have been laced when seeing a movie. Got super paranoid and ran around the area around the theater thinking every one was a cop. Ended up calming ourselves down, when were were reunited, with children's books.And for anyone wondering, my friend ended up stealthily creeping around chapters for what seemed like an eternity trying to find the exit and never did. Thought a little kid and his dad were undercover cops.

It seems like the premium Canadian dealers put on domestic silver, and the shipping costs for American Companies like Apmex, it makes buying silver very expensive.  Are there any other Canadians who experience this?

v7wmq	-12765	1340016103	nuzlocke	Reminiscence.	This is a tale, an epic, if you will, over my Soul Silver. It started off innocently, I was young and brave and willing to take on the world, when I got my Cyndaquil, Peter.We were the best around. We didn't have time for top percent Rattatta, we had places to go, people to see. But when we came across a new route with a Geodude being the first to challenge us, we took him in and gave him a name for our team: Gabe. Now, with Gabe easy to train, he soon joined Peter in stature, and thus, we continued on, this time, to Violet City. Along the way, Peter accidentally killed a friendly Zubat (you know how troublesome Cyndaquil are, but alas! They are too cute!), and soon ran across a fun little Bellsprout we soon took a liking to and named him Oscar.And, with Violet City's Pokemon Center in sight, we took a rest for the day, knowing that Bell Tower was our goal right now. But, like every patient trainer, I let my newest member, Oscar, get up a bit as he was a small little fella'. After braving the cave again, and letting Oscar show some Geodudes how it's done, we ventured back to Bell Tower.Here is where things get awesome. I start running around, totally in amazement about a moving center beam when a certain lady ran into me.That lady was a graceful Gastly, whom we endearingly caught and named Dan, because despite her grace, Dan was quite manly, and scared Oscar off a couple times. Now, with this newest teammate, I knew I had just the wonder crew needed to fight off anything. I was aware of my luck, and decided not to waste it.Insert Training Montage for Dan.Now, back to Bell Tower, where Peter made short work of everyone, we rested at the Pokemon Center. As the dawn began to set, I knew that my team was ready for Faulkner. And so, we moved on, only using two hours of sleep to their fullest, we championed Faulkner's trainers with Gabe's trusty Rock Throw, and now Faulkner stood before us.At the time I saw Faulkner, I thought him to be a befitting first gym leader, and I also found it befitting for him to use bird pokemon: My first gym leader, who was willing to soar high with his pokemon and swiftly take out any who  dared rise above him. Then Faulkner began to boast of his great ability, and I knew this would be no easy task. That was until I sent Peter out to first test the waters and realized that his father's Pidgey was mainly for show, and that Gabe might not be needed until his Pidgeotto dealt a deadly blow to Peter.And Gabe proceeded to fuck shit up, throwing rocks at Faulkner's Pidgeotto while I held Peter in my arms, looking at how such an innocent soul could've been taken to me. I sat there, tears dripping down my face as I pulled out a potion. Faulkner was trying to keep a cool head while Pidgeotto fought versus Gabe. I squirted the potion in a futile attempt to confirm what I already knew, that I had lost my number one man.And then Peter opened his eyes. Peter comes to in my arms to the sight of my tears wetting my shocked expression. I look up to Gabe, but then more grief strikes me-- As I was busy grieving over what would've been a very tough loss, Gabe is fighting a losing fight as Pidgeotto's Mud Slap has turned the tables, making Gabe's Rock Throw essentially ineffective. I call Gabe back and send out Dan this time, who takes a Mud Slap and uses Spite, which finishes Pidgeotto's reign of terror. Just as I use a potion on Gabe, though, Dan gets hit by an uncouth Gust, and before I know it, Gabe is thrust back into spree.Now, Violet City's finest had no chance, as this battle of attrition was over. Gabe finished off Pidgeotto and I stood, victorious. Tears were in my eyes as my battered band of teammates stood before me.Now, the story is already said and done, but I want to leave you guys at the start, and I will tell this as a series, depending on the community's response to this.
vcu2h	-12765	1340238084	nuzlocke	Reminiscence: Part 2	Part Two, little kiddies. Thank you for reading up until now, my smallest audience, but you get to see the next part in my story.I had fought my hardest battle up until now, and I felt it had been a fair match. I had been emotionally exhausted with multiple close calls, but in the end, my team took the hardest beating I ever thought it would, and I had come out as a champion. Peter was asleep, now, in my arms (I never let him go as I thought he died and I wasn't going to until we got to the Pokemon Center) and Dan floated next to me, obviously tired and Gabe was just sitting-- standing? He's a Geodude-- there, waiting to go.I received my Zephyr Badge from a humbled Faulkner, and proceeded to exit the gym. As soon as I did however, I got a call from Professor Elm asking me to pick up this egg from the local Mart. I tried to recall which egg, but then was reminded of the stupidest chore between Mr. Pokemon and Professor Elm that I realized why I forgot-- it was a waste of my time both doing the chore and remembering it.I left my teammate at the Pokemon Center (except Oscar, I kept him along because I had to and because he didn't see any action from the Violet Gym), and walked over to the Mart to get the Egg as well as listen to Professor Elm's Aide go on about what was said, but I wasn't really listening. When I exit the building though, something strange happens.A weird girl in the weirder dress mumbles the weirdest thing to me, and then leaves. And she wasn't even that pretty, she had tons of make-up on! I sighed at this, but then decided to head back to the Pokemon Center for a little bit of R&amp;R. By this time, the sun was rising, but I had very little sleep. And so, I rested.Now, it was about to be dusk, and I moved on to a new route, but not before getting a phone call from my Mom. She said I had left something at home, but she sent it with a mailman, whom she also gave something she bought for me. I head back to the Mart with my now fully rested team, and met up with the mailman, who then proceeded to hand over to me a Moon Stone and this odd device called a PokeWalker. I was dumbfounded, but when I looked at it, it said I had two new Pokemon. However, my answers were to be unavailable, as the mailman had left.And so, that is how I cam across Swag, the Poliwag, and Dino, the Nidoran(male). After acquainting them with my team and getting them all grinded up, we moved south. I was excited to see a Wooper present itself to us, but as I was fishing for a Pokeball, I realized something.I was out of Pokeballs. I used my last three on Dan, and was now paying the price for it.Now, with one Wooper down (and Oscar happily drenched in the blood of it's fresh kill), we moved on. I proceeded to take down any Rattatta, Hoothoot, and anything else on my way to Union Cave. In fact, I was in such an awesome mood and made so much money, the guy who sold Slowpoke Tails gave me one.No, not really. I actually beat him up, took one, and shoved it down his throat.No, not really. I actually just never talked to him. Instead, I just swept through Union Cave with relative ease, kicking the crap out of everything that moved. Everything from and Onix to a Wooper to a Zubat to a Firebreather's Koffings, I killed. It was so easy, that by the time I got out of the Cave, Peter had evolved into a Quilava, and while he was level 18, everyone else was 16.And that's how I made it to Azalea Town in twelve minutes after fighting Faulkner.But, to move on with my story, this is also how I encountered the one group that would evoke the most amount of hatred I could ever possess within myself. Team Rocket. Those slippery bastards will be the cause of so much anguish, as you will find out so much later in this story. But, as I just said, that is way long down the line. As for right now, I'm dealing with the Slowpoke Well.Because Kurt, the famed Pokeball creator, had fallen into it as per my arrival to it. And so I pressed on, hoping that the old man didn't die, and that the Rocket's can be stopped.Well, there's the second part guys. I hope you all had a good read, please give criticism, and I will continue as per Reddit's response.Have fun!EDIT: As per Shmixel's post, I realize I'm leaving a bit out. So, here's my team.Peter: CyndaquilGabe: GeodudeOscar: BellsproutDan: GastlySwag: PoliwagDino: Nidoran(male)Egg: I don't care, it's boxx'd.
vcy1t	-12765	1340242354	cavestory	Me Again.	Hello, you might remember me from my last topic.I still haven't beat the game. In fact, I just reached the plantation, because Monster X and the Core gave me the roughest time.I saved Curly though!In the meantime, what is your hardest boss? And don't be ashamed if Balrog was tough, he's killed me a few times, to be honest, so I understand.
vf14l	-12765	1340334267	nuzlocke	Reminiscence: Part 3	Hey guys! Here's a recap of what happened last story, so as to catch you guys up.Roster: Peter, Quilava(male), 18; Gabe, Geodude(male), 16; Oscar, Bellsprout(male), 16; Dan, Gastly(female), 16; Swag, Poliwag(female), 16; Dino, Nidoran(male), 16We are about to venture into the Slowpoke Well. And... Tale-Telling Time!Ahem. As I said before, Kurt, the famed Pokeball creator, had just fallen into the wall after chasing a Rocket into it. Said Rocket was now standing before me, whining about his hurt ankle, but then stood straight up as soon as I laughed at the sight. He soon challenged me to a quick battle, which felt way too easy, and went on my way while he went back to nursing his hurt ankle.Soon, I met a Wild Pokemon, a Zubat, I think, but it didn't matter much as I absentmindedly forgot to buy Pokeballs again. It was an easy kill for Peter, if I remember right, as not even Supersonic slowed him down. But now, another Rocket was guarding a staircase, this one whining about her hair getting dirty in such a dark place. Again, my laughter gave me away as she challenged me out of embarrassment, and was soon, also defeated.I pushed on and fought off more Zubats with Gabe's Rock Throw and soon reached Some "Executive Proton" guy. Really, I think if he was a higher up, I sincerely believe it's because he had different hair. Not my kind of hair cut, I wouldn't have my hair cut like that, but he somehow made it work for him, and I was impressed quite a bit! Oh well, besides his whining of grunt's whining, he was a pushover. I only worried about his Koffing, but I sent Swag out for that because of his Damp Ability.And that was the end of the Rockets in Slowpoke Well. Kurt followed me in and helped me get the slowpoke's out, and then I ended up back in his workshop so he could reward me. With Fast Balls in hand, and him making me some Pokeballs out of Green Apricots, I headed out for Ilex Forest. Until some guy I vaguely remember because he stole Professor Elm's Totodile came up to me and told me to fight him.And so, I whooped up on him. I had Dan out as the lead teammate as she knew Hypnosis, and she sweeped the Gastly, but with Croconaw out now, I switched her out for Oscar. Oscar was decent, but the enemy Croconaw was too much for him with a lucky Bite that dealt a shocking blow. I cried out in alarm, but Oscar got back up. I called him back and sent out Dino in his place. Dino, too, was a lightweight in a heavyweight match, and I called him back too. I looked down at my Pokeball I was about to throw, and knew if I didn't wrap things up quickly, this could end badly.Peter was sent out next. I got in two Quick Attacks to finish the Croconaw, and only one Water Gun (I was worried about said Water Gun) hit Peter. Soon, Gabe finished things up with the Zubat by doing some Rock Throws, and soon the red-haired kid was sent packing. I rushed back to the Pokemon Center, and healed up my guys. But then I realized that I had one last thing left to do. Fight Bugsy.So, no losses guys, I know it's really short, but I am saving Bugsy for tomorrow's part of the story! And you might even see Whitney, if I get to it. :D But, right now, I'm only up for typing up this much, and I'm in a sore mood, so I really kind of lost my knack for typing tonight.No losses, still in Azalea town! But that will change tomorrow guys. I promise! Just bear with me tonight.
vkbs2	-12765	1340613973	cavestory	Hello Again!	Sorry I'm the top poster here, and my past two topics are front page news in Mimiga Village here.Speaking of news, I messed up.I realized that I forgot to save Curly for realziez, and that she's actually been dead the whole time becaues I missed one door.One. Door.I actually feel a little less human, like a part of me has died because I allowed her to die, and that makes me a little sad.And now I'm extremely mad. I want to fight Ballos. So I have to go back to the start.And do everything over.Again.
vmfct	-12765	1340704456	atheism	Hello, /r/atheism// I'm a person with some questions.	And I hope you can provide concise answers to these questions, and try not to be too obnoxious, please?I'm a guy who likes the idea of Christ, who would be so kind so as to give me love and all that good stuff. But all the debates about abortion, homosexuals, old testament...It's a lot for a guy to take in. I mean, I want to be nice. I try to be, but no matter what I do, I'm never nice enough or I never do enough good. I feel like Christ is a great guy, he's not lying to me or anything by calling himself the Messiah or anything, but with the Bible just being so... Unique of a book in of itself, and so many different controversial things...Look. I don't know if I'm rambling or not and making any sense. But I know about God in the gaps arguments, and I find those insufficient to me. I look on /r/atheism, and I see either stories of those "Nice Christians", or I see memes or quotes or letters or parents going gay-bashing or something NOT helping me. So I decided to make my own topic where people can comment asking me things or PM me things and I can respond and have a wholesome, very educating process.I hope to you all, my voters, not to downvote me to oblivion and instead try to help me with my dilemma. Don't try to "show me the error of my ways" because I'm so ignorant so as to think following Christ is okay, but just... Just let me find my own way. Whether it leads me to God or Allah or even to the Earth Mother of Wicca, I don't care."Midway upon the journey of our life, I found myself within a forest dark, For the straight foreward pathway had been lost."I know that's the Divine Comedy, but it seems very fitting for my present moment. Props to Dante for helping me explain my predicament.EDIT: Alright, throughout the typing of this, my questions turned into this: I don't know how quite to put my questions. But, here's my dilemma, and here's what I got instead for you. My dilemma is right there, so I thought I could have people comment asking me or something, and I can respond or people can give their two cents and therefore I can have a very wholesome educating process. Sorry to disappoint, friends, I do so dearly apologize! 
vpisx	-12765	1340835667	nuzlocke	Reminiscence: Part 4	Hey guys! Sorry it took me so long! Every time I tried to get this out, Arceus forbid it by either cutting off my internet or making my computer go wonky. But now, Arceus is allowing me to type this!Here's where I left off:I am in Azalea Town, with Peter, my manly Quilava, Gabe, my rocky Geodude, Dan, my tomboyish Gastly, Oscar, my stalwart Bellsprout, Swag, my swaggin' Poliwag, and Dino, my spunky Nidroan Guy.And away we go!So, there I was, facing Bugsy. Peter had... Wait, I skipped a bit? Fine, let me go back some.I had just finished off "Gold" or whomever stole that Totodile (now Croconaw) from Prof. Elm, and I was just entering the Pokemon Center. After having healed my teammates of their battle injuries sustained from my last battle, I left the Center and headed towards the gym. I entered and was... Confused. There were Spinarak carts everywhere, and it looked kind of like a game I used to play as a kid. Undaunted, I tried to navigate a path to the nearest trainer, because EXP is always a good thing. I got on the Spinarak cart, but only to almost fall off! Almost. Peter caught me at the last second, and he helped me back onto the cart just as it stopped.I soon made Crispy Caterpie Critters outta that kid, and looked back, now cautious about the Spinarak cart. I got on, but in a crouching style and was able to maintain my balance a lot better this way. Peter stood on guard for me, in case I had a mishap like last time, but I was able to keep my composure and made it all the way back to the start, where I soon navigated another Spinarak cart over to the next portion of the gym.Another Bug Catcher stood, his Pokemon fried, and I started making my way over another Spinarak cart to the remaining trainers. Soon enough, I had finished off another Catcher, but almost fell off again because I slipped on my way onto the cart and almost fell off again. Peter was there to pick me up, yet again, and dragged me back off the front of the cart just as it docked back in place, avoiding a very messy accident. Soon, a couple of twins stood demolished as Peter got a Potion and Dino got back inside the Pokeball. I hopped back on the cart and away I went to face the guy who almost killed me with these damn carts.So, there I was, facing Bugsy. Peter had been called out first, but was surprised by the Scyther that had been called out first. I always recalled him sending out Metapod, but Scyther made this problematic. I stood, trying to seem dauntless and ordered Peter to attack with an Ember. Which ended up to finish the Scyther off quickly, because Peter was a bad-ass mother-fucker that time, and decided not to hold back and score a critical hit. After we made Scyther-ka-bobs, I let Peter kill the remaining Metapod and Kakuna. While they cooked in their shells, I received my badge from a distraught Bugsy, who was afraid about his Pokemon that just literally had their asses handed to them on a grill, and left there with the most swag a victor can have while trying not to fall off the carts.Now, I healed up my teammates (or, Peter, because Ember was getting in the yellow) and went well on my merry way. Or, atleast I was...Until I realized that I just killed my newest teammate, a Kakuna, by letting Dino get some target practice done.I sighed, looking back at the carcass wistfully. I always liked the Weedle line, for some untold, mysterious reasons unbeknownst to me, but continued on to help this little, sickly, nerdy looking kid (nice guy, but not fit for the stuffy air of Ilex Forest) and look for these Farfetch'd in the area. After I spent a minute or two battling some wild Pokemon and catching the Farfetch'd, I get the HM I need to continue, but head back to Azalea for one more thing-- Charcoal. I had already given Oscar, my awesome, kick-ass Bellsprout, a Miracle Seed and it was doing wonders for him. And now that I had a Charcoal for Peter, Peter was now a full-fledged bro.I stopped, and looked at Peter with this realization. Peter was my bro. In that sense... I called out all of my teammates. I looked at all of them, and smiled happily. These weren't  my teammates. These were my Bros. They were gonna  go to the top with me, I knew it now! Dan was a manly lady, and I knew she could take a few hits if shit hit the fan. I looked over to Gabe, who was doing... Push-ups? Whatever, I knew he'd be my tank, and that his defense would allow me to go and make mad shit happen if I needed it. Oscar was a little bit of a pansy, but I knew I could count on him if I needed him, and he'd be an irreplaceable grass type. Swag was... Man, Swag is Swag in Pokemon form. Ain't no bitch be cray enough to challenge that. Dino was a cute little fella, and I knew with one more fight under his belt, I'd let him evolve into a Nidorino now that my friend from Sinnoh gave me a Moon Stone for him (I know, that's a little cheap, but come on, I will take what I can get).And then, my eyes rested on Peter. I smiled at him, and he nuzzled his face against my cheek as I sat down to pet him. I laughed a little as I scratched behind his ear, and he just melted and rolled on the ground. I looked back at my team, and called it a day. Today was a day to relax and have fun, and I thought we'd do a bit good celebrating and chilling out for all the hard work we do together.And so, that concludes my story.Hope you all enjoyed it! Here is the current roster:Peter, QuilavaGabe, GeodudeOscar, BellsproutDan, GastlySwag, PoliwagDino, Nidoran
vuuwd	-12765	1341092985	nuzlocke	Reminiscence: Part 5	Alright guys, I'm going to try and stay on top of this. I really appreciate you guys reading this! I hope to provide my "Fire-Side" feel for this, but don't be surprised if this changes, given some events. But, all-in-all, let me give you the roster, in case you need refreshing!Roster: Peter, the Quilava (male), Gabe, the Geodude (male), Oscar, the Bellsprout (male), Dan, the Gastly (female), Swag, the Poliwag (female), Dino, the Nidoran (male).We last finished lounging in Azalea Town, blowing off some steam and letting my Bros have a good time. now, we set off again! And into the story we gooooooooooo~!So, I gave the HM Cut to Oscar, and after we wrestled that thing to give it up and teach Oscar Cut, he accidentally used it on the tree I was in front of. Astonished, and now trying to wrestle the HM out of him, we settled with the full knowledge that Oscar had a cool move now. After we finally retrieved the HM from Oscar and he figured out how to use Cut outside of battle, we continued on into the Ilex Forest. We went on, getting Headbutt and teaching it to Dino and engaged in our first battle using Headbutt. I sent out Dino against a Pineco. I was worried that the Pineco using Self-Destruct before I could kill it, so I switched Dino out with Dan, just in case...... It used Self-Destruct as it's first move. It did no damage to Dan, and instead totally gave Dino the EXP he needed. I watched in happy anticipation as Dino evolved into Nidorino, and then proceeded to shove the Moon Stone down Dino's throat happily, which caused him to evolve into.. Nidoking! Now, I had this hulking mass of a Poison/Ground type behind me, and he was certainly my biggest Pokemon as of yet, and would assuredly stay that way for quite a while, given the fact that I didn't know Typhlosion was taller than Nidoking or not. We continued on, and there was another weird lady in a ton of makeup and this wacky dress ask for directions. Just as I was about to show her where the nearest exit was because I'm such a gentleman and totally not because I still thought she was cute or anything, Peter committed to cock-clock me and went around, being a good kid and showed her the way out.After ignoring the efforts to keep me single, I pressed on, starting to get tired of Ilex Forest and went out into the sunlight of Route 34. I looked at my band of bros, and was pleased with what I saw. Almost all of my Pokemon were in the green, and we proceeded to battle every trainer on the way to Goldenrod, since we were way OP for this Route. I was stopped momentarily by a girl, telling me to go to the daycare. She was my neighbor, from back in New Bark, but I really didn't think she'd be out this far.After the detour to the daycare, I whooped on another kid, and went into the grass to find a new teammate. It was...... A Rattatta. And so, I proceeded to turn it into a pile of gore and blood, and happily continued on my way. I went straight to the Pokemon Center, and tried every place of interest in the Goldenrod City area. I stayed up all afternoon playing in the Game Corner (gambling has definitely taken a turn for the worst), but finally got an Abra! Thank Arceus for Adrian coming onto my team, with how much time I took to get him! I looked up at the time, and smiled.T'was nighttime. Police officers are in the vicinity. It is now time to fight the Police Officers, show them that I can beat the ever-loving crap outta them, take their money, and proceed to break the law since that Officer was thoroughly beaten. I sent out Swag, who proceeded to Swag it up with a Swaggin' Water Gun. She waltzed around, proceeding to finish off the Growlithe by doing a Taco Touchdown (a female variant of a teabag. You'll get it sooner or later as to why it's called the Taco Touchdown), and then happily swagg'd right back over to me. I smiled, petting her on the head and walked off, taking the Officer's money and dignity.And now... I must rest at the Pokemon Center. For soon, I challenge Whitney. I get in the rent-a-room bed with my Pokemon taking up assorted spaces throughout the room that Nurse Joy was happy to offer. Swag got her own tub, and sighed as she floated around in it. Peter snuggled up to me and gave me the warmest bed I ever had. Dan doesn't sleep, so she just stared at us happily (and creepily, but we were all used to each other), while Gabe was given a big box of dirt that he dug himself a little hole into and slept. Oscar also slept in the same box of dirt by letting it's "feet" dig into the dirt and let them take root for a night. Lastly, Dino just picked a corner and sat down criss-cross apple-sauce (I still say that. If you have trouble knowing what that is, go to kindergarden again. Or, just pm me, and I while inform you.) and fell asleep like that.And so, on this night, we slept. Tomorrow, we would challenge Whitney and her stupid Gym. I looked over my team one more time, smiling back at Dan, who seemed elated that I smiled before I fell asleep, and had one last thought.Ain't no way some bitch-ass Miltank is gonna kill any of my Pokemon. Ain't no way. Ain't NO way.And so, I proceeded to sleep.Roster is as follows:Peter, Quilava,Gabe, Geodude,Oscar, Bellsprout,Dan, Gastly, Swag, Poliwag,Dino, NidokingI hope you guys enjoyed this short chapter in my long Nuz-Run! Enjoy!

yy74c	-12765	1346135213	SecretSubreddit	I have returned (with a crowbar and Doug)!	If you remember me, I was on the subject of mapping out the vents. And like any great adventure, this one has a tale.So, I started out some time ago in Sector D, using a very basic map that had circulated the offices. The vents are mysterious, enlightening! I was amazed at the sheer scope that such a small system could contain! If fact, I was filled with such splendor that I had forgotten my first two meals mapping out the vents! I spent so long, often returning to my desk momentarily to receive supplies. I traveled multiple stories, through a couple sectors (Projects _______, _______, and _________ remain anonymous, I closed off those through necessary means), but soon, I made a discovery.I call it "The Hive", because it isn't in any sectors. Or floors. Rather, it is somehow a huge vented room, with multiple fans and whatnot that seem to be the epicenter of the vents. It is a wondrous place.And a dangerous one.In discovering the Hive, I soon stumbled upon the second greatest discovery in my time in the Vents.The Beast.In fact, had there not been so many lost crowbars in the Hive near my location, I might not be here at this time (yeah, our last shipment ended up there somehow, I think the Beast may be a problem to our shipping department). The Beast and I fought long and hard (and if my memory serves me right, Hurricane Isaac was a result, sorry Project _____, maybe next time you can do it!), and soon I was whittled down to my last crowbar. I swung at the Beast, who retaliated with a swift claw swipe at my pack. The pack was torn from me, and as it was distracted by my supplies pack, I took this chance to run.Run I did. After weeks of mapping the Vents, I remembered my way through the maze, perhaps as well as the Beast. I was faster, albeit tired, than it as well, and that's how I'm back at my desk in Sector D.I held my crowbar valiantly as I went to check my spoils, and soon was aghast. My pack held my map, and the Vents held my memory of the intricacies of itself.Sathion, Project ________ was neither a failure or an accopmlishment, but rather an investment into our safety as well as efficiency.Also, I found Doug along the way. Poor Bastard was stuck in there for a few months when I found him. He also had a couple crowbars.Last note, Project _____ needs to keep their shit out of the Vents. Nasty little shit in their Sector leaks into it. I would like to submit Document _____ for review, as well as Form ______ for my exploration of the Vents.Footnotes: Upon the realization of the Hive and the Beast, such nouns were used to protect the possible ties with their existence and certain Projects, for clarification.
112rty	-12765	1349586618	cavestory	Man, it's good to be back.	Well guys, it's been a while since I last played Cave Story. I let Curly die, and that just killed me. So I tried to start over and... Well, it wasn't that appealing. So, I left it alone...Until now.I'm playing on my computer and got back to where I was and even surpassed! Now, I face an even larger problem. Whereas Monster X and the Core gave me problems, now it's not even a boss that's kicking my ass. Now? It's the fucking Last Cave (Hidden). That shit is hard as balls. I'm dying left and right like all the spikes left all over the place! When I try to just run through it like I see in all the "Hell Runs", where they time themselves? I die faster and make it an even shorter distance.Seriously, this shit is hard with 50 Health.
114fhk	-12765	1349670597	SecretSubreddit	Alright, really?	After I mapped out the Vents (or attempted to, still working on getting my map back), and finding Doug as well as the Hive, people have the audacity to take the lunch I so *carefully* designate as mine? I mean, do you have to go into my personal fridge to take my food? This is just annoying.I will not take kindly to this. My crowbar? Yeah, you'll know it real good if you keep this up.Oh, Sector D-12? I know you're Sentries are missing, I filled out a form, but I... Acquired them last week. I think the paper's are now in order, but thanks for the loan! And D-11, if it's you Steve...... Steve, if it's you, fuck you.

I'm trying to find a guy who, in Episodes 1 and 2, made a few decisions. Maybe it'll help with finding it for me.He chose to save Ducky, sided with Kenny, let the girl in the Hotel kill herself... Hmm. That's Episode 1.Episode 2, he fed Clementine, Ducky, Kenny, and Mark. What else... He also stopped Clementine from eating Mark's leg meat. He tried to save that a-hole of an old man. He killed one brother (and lamented that Clementine saw it), he then spared the other brother and didn't steal.Also, he did his own (On the last Walking Dead), and it was very brief and comical, for example: Last time, on the Walking Dead: Shit!It goes on...So, can I get any help?

157b06	-12765	1356055459	GetMotivated	Well, What Words Were Said.	Well Wolves, I had an interesting ride home with my sister. I was driving her home tonight from helping out at her Tae Kwon Do place (she is a Red Belt), and we were talking of my virginity. She had lost hers to her girlfriend and when she confronted my lack of virginity, I countered with how close I'd been, had it not been with my friend's girlfriend.She chuckled, looked at me and said this. "Wisdom, I've seen you without your shirt on. I've seen you in just your Captain America boxers and all your other boxers because that's what you sleep in and Mom makes me wake you up in the morning. I can confidently say this: You are not attractive, and no woman would want to tap that."That... That gets a man thinking. But I don't know what to think. And so, I posted it here, to spur on creative thought (and maybe give me a course to start thinking on, which it didn't). I don't what to say to you Wolves, but thought I'd share this with you, if nothing else. If you guys have advice or anything, just message me or comment. Hope it was a good read.

I think I will be fine until I transplant to ground this fall.I've done some research, and found that it's best to transplant in spring or fall, but not in summer.any advice for first time transplanting from pots.also, I would love to plant a couple of my dwarf jades, in earth, for a couple years. but I don't know if possible in zone 7. is mulching and other forms of winter protection enough? makeshift greenhouse perhaps?

So, yeah, as the title says, I was given a white Wii U that was used for a demo kiosk (store had taken down the display months ago and this was just sitting in the back.) Plugged it up and it turns on, but immediately defaults to a demo reel of advertising and asks me to connect the gamepad. The back of the system has extra inputs that the gamepad (which is corded) plugs into. I was just wondering if there's any way to get the thing out of demo mode to use as a full fledged console or if I just need to toss it. Any help would be appreciated!
2p3mvq	-12798	1418409506	amiibo	Why are there so many Zeldas?!	Does Nintendo have some kind of data showing that she is some super popular character that the rest of us don't know about?

2pkupx	-12798	1418827117	amiibo	Nintendo needs to get their shit together.	I'm going to preface this by saying that I am a longtime Nintendo supporter, even supporting them through their stumbles and bumbles in the past. I currently only own a Wii U and a 3DS, having sold a PS4 because I was bored with it. Nintendo is almost like family to me because it helped me through a lot of rough times as a child. I love them. Having said that, though...Nintendo needs to get its shit together.To say that the amiibo situation is a fiasco is putting it mildly. If you combine the mysterious disappearance of some figures, the odd split of wave 2, the uncertainty of wave 3, and the "having to stay up all night to order a $12.99 toy" issue, it's one giant clusterfuck of stupidity. And there's a clear solution. All it would take is a clear, concise, official statement from Nintendo. But yet we sit here with nothing. No word from the company. And that tells me something: they know they've screwed up. They know they didn't make enough to meet demand and instead of just coming out and saying it, they hide behind vague statements like the ones that have been released. For a company who claims to be "for the fans" so much, they really have screwed the fans over on this one. Just release a statement, Nintendo. Give people a clear word. Then maybe some of this shitstorm will subside. Maybe.

A terrible thought entered my mind tonight as I strolled into my local Walmart's amiibo section. Given all the trouble with Gold Mario lately (a figure that was largely called "unwanted" until it went up for preorder), why would we expect the April Marth release to be any different?, unless Nintendo manages it differently, or finds a way to sell direct, and only one per customer as well? I just see it going very badly yet again, no matter how hard they try or how many they make. Not saying Marth will be store exclusive like GM, but just thinking about how crazy the preorder nonsense with him has been.

Well, to be honest, it just stopped working for iMessage. It still works for iCloud, the app store, and everything else, it just doesn't work for iMessage. I first noticed it on my 2012 model iMac that I use in my office, but then I also noticed that no one was responding to my texts if they were sent via iMessage. A "quick" (2 hour and 30 minute) call to Apple Support and all they were able to do was take my info, and escalate the issue to engineers.  They did determine that it was a problem with the ID itself, but it was working earlier that morning and suddenly stopped.  Anyone ever had this happen? I would love to hear what you did to fix it.

The process involves a short physical exam your first time, a medical questionnaire, and then every subsequent time a brief medical screening. The screening involves taking your vitals and pricking your finger to take a blood sample in order to make sure you have enough iron and protein in your blood to complete the donation without any reaction. If you pass they stick you will a needle, take a moderate amount of blood, and then return the red blood cells while keeping the plasma. Most people will qualify, you only have to be relatively healthy. There are centers in most cities.TL;DR They'll pay you 50 bucks a week to stab you twice.

10g618	-12808	1348580480	CampingandHiking	I am desperately searching for info on the River to River Trail - Illinois	I am in the midwest (southern Indiana) and am planning to do a AT thru hike in 2014 or 2015. In the interim I am trying to soak up some shorter (but still long) thru hikes. Logistically, the most logical trail to hike in this years fading season is the "River to River" trail in southern Illinois. I have done about as much internet and book research as I can. The trail is 160 miles long, seems hard to follow at times, and the book gives no information as far as streams/creeks/lakes to get water and resupply points. (I own the "River to River Trail Guide" 4th edition 2011) The guide also says it takes two weeks to hike.What I really need is anecdotal info from people who have already hike all or most of the trail (especially if they did so in the past couple years). * Is water easily available along the trail? I don't want to have to carry tons with me out of ignorance but I might.* Is the trail really so difficult to follow? I have the guide book as I said which has good maps and written directions* How long will it take someone with hiking experience who is in good physical shape to hike this trail? At 14 days (the guides suggestion) it would be about 11 miles a day. I know I can do a lot better than that, but I am not entirely familiar with the terrain. Are 20 mile days doable? 25?* I would LOVE to hear anyones thoughts are experiences that aren't related to any of these bullets points.So if i get answers to these questions that don't align with my ideas and expectations then I will need to find another trail. Does anyone have any suggestions about other trails in the 50-150 mile range that would be similar (or better)?

11ltcv	-12808	1350438703	bikewrench	Front derailleur problem. 	Ok, this might be a little drawn out put the main issue is that I cannot seem to get my front derailleur to shift to all three chain-wheels (it either shifts to the smallest and middle, or biggest and middle). I have tried loosening and tightening the limiter screws for both lower and higher limits. I have messed with the tension of the shifter cable quite a bit. I have also adjusted the height at which the derailleur sits on the seat tube (it is a braze-on). The derailleur is a Shimano Tiagara triple. The crank is a Shimano RSX triple. and the shifters are Shimano RSX ergo (STI). I am afraid the derailleur just might not ever work as I can normally adjust them relatively easily.

I have some idea on a few of the parts I'll be getting to do the job but could use your guys' help compiling a nice list. If it is of any consequence the frame is the 58cm size. [The Bike](http://surlybikes.com/bikes/long_haul_trucker).I am pretty set on getting a [Sugino xd600 crankset (in 175mm)](http://www.amazon.com/Sugino-175mm-26-36-46-74-110-7-8-Speed/dp/B001GSSE2Q)Some staples that will probably find their way on my bike are a Shimano XT rear derailleur, Tektro Oryx canti brakes, and a Tiagra triple front derailleur. Outside of these I'm really not set on anything. I'm sure I want STI (ergo, brifter) shifters over bar-end. I know a lot of the build is about personal taste, comfort and feel but I could definitely use some input/insight from people that have had these parts underneath them for miles and miles. Oh and a good wheelset I suppose would be one of the forst things I should look into.

1kgtqf	-12808	1376625129	discexchange	[T] A sun/snow beaten 11x Champion Eagle	So this is a weird one. I found it in a field on the other side of a barbed wire fence during a round a few weeks ago. Not in the greatest shape as i think it had been out there for time. [Top](http://imgur.com/tagti9i,9Ly7PaV,kGWsYWy) [Bottom](http://imgur.com/tagti9i,9Ly7PaV,kGWsYWy#1) [Side](http://imgur.com/tagti9i,9Ly7PaV,kGWsYWy#2). The plastic is actually in decent shape, there is the appearance of pitting on top of the disc but it feels relatively smooth, they just seem to be sun spots or something. The stamp has worn almost completely off. I'm not a great thrower but when I tossed it a couple times it seemed to still have its stability. Not sure really what its worth in that kind of shape but my understanding is that the people who like this disc really like it so I would rather it go to someone who is gonna throw it if that person is out there. I'd like some sort of firebird or a xxx to complement my thumbers if anyone has one lying around. Ill consider whatever. 
1klwp8	-12808	1376839720	discgolf	Suggestions on improving my disc selection.	I use a Nutsac to carry my discs. It really only holds seven, eight if I push it so that's my upper limit. I will list my discs and the reason I have them if it isn't obvious. During any given round I throw back hand 50-60% of the time and use these throws for distance; forehand is used about 30% of the time and mostly for low ceiling/tight window shots; and thumber for shots over obstacles or in certain utility shots (very occasionally rollers).MVP ion soft - putterRoc3 - a good midrange that I also use as an overstable putterTeebird - my favorite disc does what I want it to either forehand or backhandLat64 River - I can forehand it down a straight line and it glides foreverValkyrie - An understable disc to turnover, roll or shape some shots with (I'm still not great at throwing this one for distance for some reason)Destroyer - most recent additions, looking for a fast driver to finally carry towards 400ftMonster - only for thumbers or very bendy forehands (considering changing it out for a firebird)So I guess I am just looking for suggestions regarding any glaring holes in my set-up or discs I might not have considered but should. Any disc I add with have to replace one already in the bag as there isn't really room for more.

I'm still relatively new to the whole PDGA player raring thing. I have been playing intermediate tournaments for about 1.5 years now. Going into this weekend my player rating was 850. Well, I played a tournament at my "home course" and did super well. My rounds were rated at 968 and 954. What can I expect to see as a future player rating? I think I only played one sanctioned tourney last year, and two the year before that. Just kinda curious how the PDGA decided on player rating (if they weigh current over past etc.). Thanks!

The guy who got him his mortgage or whatever the fuck he did, I have no idea what his actual job title is, told him the bank won't give you a loan because you want to START a business, not expand a currently existing one that you already own. Now that just doesn't sound right to me at all. The idea of a bank not giving out a loan to someone to start a business in the field that the person has been in for over a decade sounds ridiculous to me. Anyone care to shed some light on this situation?

ilja1	-12825	1310295162	gameofthrones	I'm re-reading the series before the new book comes out, and just got to the chapter where Arya and Ned has a father-daughter conversation... [very minor spoiler from book 1]	...the one where he discovers Needle and talks about how the family has to stay together now that winter is coming.And damn, this is powerful stuff when you know all that is going to transpire later. It seemed like my tears welled up every second paragraph, alternatingly from sorrow and joy. How Martin conveys the love between father and daughter is breathtaking. This is one of his absolute best chapters, IMO.I was afraid that re-reading the first book after just having seen the TV series would be a little dull. How very wrong I was.

Why? What has he done for the Lannisters to earn such a grand price? Was he somehow complicit in RW without even attending it? And why did both Grey Wind and Catelyn have such a bad feeling about him?

Watching the stream from the main stage last night, I had to go to bed after the match between Naniwa and Soulkey (I'm watching from Europe).

20rmo0	-12825	1395188529	hearthstone	Humble request for Arena pick advice	So I am drafting this Druid deck and got off to a good start with the Force of Nature + Savage Roar combo right off the bat. I think it's looking very good so far, but I am in large doubt about this next pick:http://i.imgur.com/2DU3fkv.jpgOn the one hand, having more taunts would be good to survive until the lategame where I can really get some Force of Nature value. On the other hand, I already have a lot of 4 drops, and an extra Power of the Wild seems handy in case I have to use the first one as a Panther.I therefore turn to the collective wisdom of r/hearthstone. What would you have picked?PS: I know Naturalize is terrible, but it was that or Healing Touch and some other crap. Hopefully I can use it as part of a win condition if I need to bypass some taunt.EDIT: Thanks a lot for the input! I will go for PotW then and try it out in Arena after work. I will update afterwards with how it goes.EDIT 2: Alright, I finished the draft and managed to snag some nice picks to fill out my curve: http://i.imgur.com/0Hu3UhU.jpgThe last cards below the cut are Force of Nature, 2x Starfire, Sunwalker and Ironbark Protector. Taking it for a spin now!EDIT 3: Ok, so I ended up going only 2-3. First two losses were due to unlucky draws against a mage and a shaman, and the last to a mage with double Flamestrike and Ragnaros. But it was still really fun! My wins were against a hunter and a mage when I started off with perfect curve and got to use the combo as intended. I had to use Naturalize once against the shaman avoid lethal, but as expected he killed me later with the cards he drew. Thanks for the help!
26v8pi	-12825	1401450431	hearthstone	Onyxia + Savage Roar = 12-0 Arena	I managed my first ever 12-0 in Arena, and I just have to brag a little bit.Proof, decklist and rewards: http://imgur.com/a/lTMKPMy previous record was 9-3, so this was a big jump forward for me. I picked Onyxia over Gruul about halfway through the draft, and the very next pick was Savage Roar. I took this as a hint and managed to build a decent Control Druid around it.Onyxia turned out to be a really valuable asset. She turned the game completely around several times in different ways. The most obvious was to put her down and play Savage Roar the next turn as a massive surprise burst. This turned out to be the finisher in several games, in addition to Savage Roar on its own when I kept board control. The biggest burst was more than 30 damage, which took the poor Shaman completely by surprise. But she also saved me from losing once when my opponent had just cleared my board and had a big board himself. I stabilized by putting down Onyxia with an innervated Mark of the Wild and could use the whelps as my own board clear the next turn.But she didn't work alone. The Ancient of War carried me to my strong endgame several times, and the card draw from Nourish, Wrath and Starfall turned out really useful.The final boss was a Paladin, who brought me down to 1 health so I thought I was done for. But by hiding behind a series of taunts such as Sunwalker and Fen Creeper, I managed to bring the game around.Anyways, I am really happy about it and had to share it with someone. It came after a long series of 3-3 and 4-3 runs, so I thought I had reached my skill ceiling.

They are regularly throwing in small comments explaining elementary SC2 strategy and the function of the different units, without breaking stride in the commentary. This is a huge asset to new viewers, of which there are more than usual today. Many viewers and audience members will have carried over from the CS:GO final, or will be at the arena for other reasons. For keeping their interest and maybe inspire them to check out more SC2 in the future, these explanations are invaluable. I know the feeling of tuning into a LoL or DotA stream and not understanding anything of what's happening, and am happy for the people coming the other way who get a chance to experience SC2 properly for the first time.

Originally, I put as many high toughness:mana cost ratio cards ( [[Indomitable Ancients]] ) in the deck. This quickly failed since very few of the creatures would every attack with Doran on the board. Now, I am trying to re-purpose Doran in a general control shell. I am pushing [[Birthing Pod ]] hard, and trying to keep 1 beater in every cc slot. Is this a good idea?Additionally, I am trying to figure out of [[Reveillark]] + [[Saffi Eriksdotter]] is worth including. Other graveyard recursion? Looking for any suggestions. No budget limitations. Ulamog is in the deck to get my graveyard back into my library so I can search it all out again. Or, if the game goes long, cast for 11. The meta:Mass LD is frowned upon.Infinite Combos are banned. Decks:* [[Rhys the Redeemed]] - tokens* [[Angus Mackenzie]] - Do nothing. Ever. * [[Ulasht, the Hate Seed]] - Gruul Ramp.

Do nothing with them, pass turn.* [[Sydri, Galvanic Genius]] - Artifact control. * [[Sliver Overlord]] - My other deck. Any feedback is appreciated. Thanks in advance.

q55r1	-12831	1330148558	Paranormal	Weird Flashing Light	Ok, so I was pretty straight forward in the title.I'll start from the beginning: Two nights ago my mom told me about this light (kind of like a flashlight) shining in her doorway through the sheet she has hanging to seperate her room from the living room. I told her there could have been anything to cause it. Not likely anything paranormal or weird. She also told me of this little light flashing on the wall beside her tv, on the door frame. Fast forward to tonight. I'm standing by her bed talking to her in the dark when I see this flash out of the corner of my eye. I turn and look but don't see anything so I just keep talking. A minute or two later I see it again. That's when I mention it to her and tell her maybe she isn't crazy after all. So I wait till I see it again, pinpoint the location and look for it after getting her to turn on the light. I went through everything by the door and found nothing. The light was green. The only electronic things in her room is the lamp and her alarm clock, both of which were by her. Now, I thought maybe something was coming in through the cracks in her curtains, but no. I tried everything I could to make that light happen and got nothing. The weird part is I got right up to the wall and saw it flash a few times. Towards the end the light changed to a white light, bigger than the green that actually swooped in a small space twice. My paranormal friends I can't figure this one out. Nothing that I can find or do caused that light. Also quickly there is a wooden thing right in front of where the light was. No shadow was cast by it. So it had to be on the wall and by the look of the light it was something straight on most of the time. Any ideas or clues?

uhh9o	-12831	1338662811	Paranormal	Footsteps In The Hall	This happened yesterday as I was sitting in my room, alone in the house, much as I am today. I tend to have the day to myself when it's warm out, the only other person home is my Aunt and she had went somewhere. My mom and two brothers were at work. From about two I had been alone, not a big deal as I have grown up in this house, seen weird things, heard weirder things, I just pass them off.Bored out of my mind I decided to watch the movie Slither, I haven't seen it since it came out in theaters (2006...man time flies) so I was excited for it. Volume is way up, I'm hanging out waiting any moment for my brother to come home since it's about five and he gets in around that time. I hear someone walk through the hall. My bed is near the wall so I can hear it pretty well when people walk through, I hadn't heard the front door open so I decided to go check who was there. No one. Entire house was clear. The fun didn't end there. I heard something walking when I was in the kitchen trying not to freak out as well. And now as I sit here typing this I can hear something in the hall again. My brother told me the front door was locked so I know that no one has come in, I refuse to go check this time. No one will be home soon. I have three hours left  alone.

vgbi3	-12831	1340397958	UFOs	Triangle in the Sky	When I was a kid I was heavily interested in UFO's. My brothers and I would spend our nights playing and looking up to the sky in hopes of catching a glimpse of something not from this world. About the time X-Files came on, when I was six, we really got interested in flying saucers and anything paranormal. One night we were watching tv, laying on the floor while my mom and Grandma were in the kitchen talking and drinking coffee. I remember I kept looking at the door to the hall and I wanted to go out there. Finally I gave in, walked out of the room, and right to the front door. I remember I was just tall enough to peek out the window, I lifted the curtain and glanced at my neighbors house. There it was. The one thing we had been seeking out for a couple years already and I had even prayed to see...a UFO. It hovered over my neighbors house, only 15-20 feet above it. It was triangle, with rounded corners. It had what looked like three circles on each corner that reminded me of rockets from space shuttles. In the center was a circle that looked like it could open. The sides of the ship were kinda rounded out that glowed like windows or lights. I can't remember if I saw a figure standing there or if my imagination added that later. I put one hand on the door knob, then realized I needed to get my brothers to show them this wonderful awesome discovery. Dashing back in the hall I yelled at them to come look and come see the UFO, it was real and it was just hovering there. When we got back to the door it was gone. My brothers thought I was making it up or had imagined it, but what pulled me to go out there? Why did I walk into the hall for no reason when I was really into whatever show we were watching? I'll never know those answers, but I'll always know there is something out there. That we aren't alone in the universe.

We have two 1/2" x 4" long 2 micron rating stones.  Since there is more surface area with the stones would that mean I could get away with a lower carbonation psi and a quicker turn around?  Right now we carb at 28psi and they kegs are ready in about five days at 36 degrees.

The purpose of which is to allow banks to issue their own digital currency or charities or nonprofits can issue digital vouchers that are backed by bitcoins, this will allow for distributed (currency) exchanges, no more MtGox type shenanigans!One benefit of this is that local banks can create their own digital currency that they can use fractional reserve banking to generally stabalize prices for local vendors.Charities or Nonprofit organizations can create vouchers that for example could give discounts for buying certain things. School vouchers for example, where people donate and give a discount to parents on their kids education. Or a boycott charity that creates vouchers for buying nonGMO non-monsanto products. To expand upon that schools can create a block chain that represents open seats that can be exchanged for vouchers, a food producer could create a block chain that represents food products that are nonGMO and put QR or bar codes that could be scanned and easily exchanged for vouchers from vendors and the vouchers then exchanged for bitcoins.

Why is it limited or said to be limited to human action and not action in general.I understand it must differentiate itself from aspects of science which deal with historical and subject value, since those can change and be corrected with new observations and they can lead to false or misleading conclusions.Praxeology is typically compared to math, but math is used in just about every science, so I would think you could apply praxeology to just about every science as well.

Most writers seem to think its a given that liberals (or so called) would support Basic Income, so I'm asking reddit who are they? At the very least they deserve applaud and recognition on this subreddit.My skepticism of the liberal support comes from the fact that liberal parties like the Democrats, and many that call themselves liberals, really just support unions and government jobs and government regulation, since those are their lobbies. Basic Income, while doesnt entirely get rid of them, reduces the need for unions and government jobs and regulations.I tried searching the Internet with "basic income" and names of famous liberals, and even switzerland "minimum income", and nothing came up and in some cases it showed me minimum wage instead.

1s1m9w	-12846	1386123530	BasicIncome	Basic Income as natural progression of Democracy	Politicians have enjoyed being paid to vote on legislation since the beginning of our government. Paid both by government and special interests. But our own ability to vote on who occupies these offices is very under valued. One way you can tell our voting is valuable, is in the fact they spend so much on campaigning to manipulate our votes.It goes with out saying, that they are getting a really good deal, thanks to corporate mass media providing the voting public as a neat package for sale. The education of the people in general and on the issues is also reduced by people not having as much time in their life, and dependence on TV to tell them who to vote for.Basic Income would be the end manifestation of our power to vote. It would give us time to understand the issues clearly and intellectually instead of as an emotional gut reaction that we get today.

1uk6z1	-12846	1389037760	coindev	Human readable transaction signing	Anyone developing a crypto currency today should consider supporting human readable transaction that can be hashed and signed, instead of just binary transactions.Transactions could still be binary to speed up general processing, but conversion to text would be necessary for signing and validation of the signed transaction. This means that conversion to text needs to be standardized so that its reproducible across implementations, which may include support for multiple languages, or maybe it is expected that when presenting the text to a user, software can provide translation, but that this translation is not what is hash/signed.This would allow for a user to see what it is exactly they are signing and can make way for future software and hardware where a single key could sign many different transactions, contracts, documents, and messages. Instead of having multiple proprietary binary formats that need to be interpreted before presenting to a user, and where a hacker could trick a user into signing something else than what is presented by intercepting and reinterpreting what is presented to the user in a transaction.We could then have a standard signing API, that many software applications could support such as point of sale, or web browsers with a W3C JavaScript binding. An application could use the API to prompt a user to sign something, a user then picks which key to sign with (if the keys are local), or alternatively the user could use a device (like Trezor) to keep their keys safe and plug it in or do an NFC swipe and can see what it is they are signing on the device itself, the device wouldn't need to know all the different binary data formats of transactions and contracts, and just present text to the user that can be signed, and then be able to send the signature back.Such a feature, I think, could be added to Bitcoin and derivatives, by adding new operations to script, so that to verify a transaction a human readable text version of the transaction must be generated, hashed and have been signed with the correct private key.
1vgsv0	-12846	1389985395	bitcloud	Deception and Proof of Bandwidth and alternatives	It seems that anyway you arrange proof of bandwidth you can get a lot of spoofing.For example the current proposal of max-upload speed and verification:https://github.com/wetube/bitcloud/wiki/Proof-of-BandwidthThere is nothing to prevent or discourage node operators from creating fake users which say they are downloading (with out actually downloading) from their node and reducing their max upload bandwidth, with out actually having to send data, or creating other fake nodes which claim to verify their node with out actually having verified it. You might even have node operators who give each other kick backs for lying.I think we need to replace Proof of Bandwidth with something I call Proof of Users. Where each new block in the block chain, must generate problems that can only easily be solved by a human, and then the nodes that can get these solutions the fastest will solve the block and receive the benefits of it. Users who solve these problems can gain free coins to be able to download stuff with, similar to miners in a pool.Then the nodes in the network can gain coins from users downloading from them.

29c327	-12846	1403978826	Anarcho_Capitalism	What makes someone a capitalist?	Does merely owning capital make someone a capitalist?Does desiring to own capital make someone a capitalist?Or do you need to believe that private individuals should be able to own and trade capital, to be considered a capitalist?Even more fundamental, what defines private versus public? To me conceptually, public property not only doesn't exist, but can't exist because of theft, such as someone (or some institution) taking the public property as their property though they may still call it public.To me the answers to these questions is what fundamentally separates AnCaps and other Anarchisms.
29uapb	-12846	1404495902	Bitcoin	Does anyone else think IMEI should be replaced by Smart Property	I was thinking of unlocking a cellphone I just purchased to move to another carrier with better prices, and I was trying to find out if the phone is locked, and so I started reading online forums and it seems that the current system is a huge mess.With IMEI it seems each service company has its own database, or some how the lock can get lost when multiple companies are involved (buying your device from google, and trying to unlock from a carrier). Users are sometimes told their device can't be unlocked and can't be given a reason. Others find there device is not listed as locked by the carrier though they know their device is locked because another carrier cant be used.Having a public ledger, where its easy to look up and verify and transfer ownership of cellphones, doing it like bitcoin, would get rid of this broken confusing system. You could have contracts (requiring multiple signatures to transfer) where a user has a debt lean on their cellphone, and if someone wants to buy the phone from them or transfer that debt to another (like a carrier willing to take over their debt) they could do that also.https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Smart_Property

My Facebook is exploding with people talking about Net Neutrality and I did a courtesy and read the articles they've posted and they are total crap, using ad homnems against Ted Cruz, and one stating that Cruz doesn't know what Net Neutrality is with themselves only knowing the slogan of Net Neutrality and its intentions but not knowing a damn thing about the proposed changes to regulation and law and whether those proposed changes will even meet their expectations.Now, I got excited when one of them who originally said unregulated ride share services are dangerous and worried about rape, suddenly was saying how great Uber is, even going so far as to debate someone using libertarian arguments about taxis and state privilege. And I laughed when another complained about their health insurance being screwed by Obamacare (although they still think Universal healthcare is the way to go :P). This time around is just annoying and many more are coming out of the wood works feeling like election season.They are gagging over the Forbes article on Net Neutrality (I didn't share it with them), are there any articles that can appeal to liberals at all? Or even something technical that looks at the proposed regulations and not just the intentions.

2qy5kt	-12846	1420056915	philosophy	Arguments derived from all terms originating from subjective experience.	In philosophy we are not arguing if something is subjectively true but if it is objectively true.All terms are subjectively true but they are not all objectively true. 'Free will' and karma are true in reference to subjective experience, a person can experience a lack of determinism in their choices and they may notice a coincidence of justice.Subjective experience will never be able to fully answer the question of objective truth. We can imagine a world, like the matrix, where nothing is real. We can imagine a world that conspires to make an individual believe they do not have objective 'free will', or that there is no objective 'karma' (like René Descartes evil genius). Being able to imagine that doesn't mean we couldn't imagine a world where no one has objective 'free will' or karma. I say this to express the limits of language and not claims about anything beyond subjective experience.Maybe you now notice, this same idea applies to the term 'objective' itself. Something appearing as 'objective' is also part of subjective experience. We can say then that 'objective reality' is part of the subjective experience, just as free will is. This also creates the question, is 'objective reality' objectively true, which just like karma and free will cannot be answered through language derived from subjective experience, we lack the means in language to answer this question. That is we end up falling back to something being true to subjective experience, since it is the only answer we can make and it be true.We do not have a word for something that is true beyond all subjective experience, the term 'objective' is used to describe things that are true in regard to the collection of subjective experience (which is why objective truth is always changing with subjective experience). If we create a new term, the term is also derived from subjective experience, and reason will make it true within subjective experience (all terms being true in regard to their subjective experience origin) but reason cannot make it true beyond subjective experience or collective subjective experience. We then end up with a duplicate term for objective truth.Maybe there is a simpler way of saying this and I have made it more complicated then it needs to be. And maybe I butchered the language.This is not to dissuade the pursuits of objective truth, but to keep the pursuit in context. We push terms to their limits to know what those limits are, a term that sits against objective reality is simply bigger than our subjective experience of objective reality at the moment.The confusion though this produces, is that some things can be both true and false (subjectively true, objectively false) which may also influence a persons view of the rest of the world, cause arguments, create philosophies built on incoherence. The source of this is using terms out of the context of the subjective experience and collective subjective experience.
2qyej9	-12846	1420062013	economy	Does Keynesianism discriminate on different kinds of unemployment?	I've read the argument several times that Keynesianism reduces unemployment, increases employment. So what I wonder is, does it only affect involuntary unemployment or does it also affect voluntary unemployment? For example, retirement causes unemployment, and so reducing peoples ability to retire increases peoples need to remain employed and collectively suppresses wages with an increased workforce.If it does discriminate how does it do this?
2r4baz	-12846	1420221962	Anarcho_Capitalism	What if citizenship could be traded?	What if you were allowed to trade your citizenship with someone of another country? That seems like a way for laws to compete. It could establish market values of citizenship, it would also allow countries to see if choices they have made cause citizenship to be more or less valuable. I'm trying to think of reasons this would be rejected.
2rc8nb	-12846	1420410544	Anarcho_Capitalism	Natural Values	If we value things in and of themselves we lose touch with real values.Property rights have a natural value to society in resolving issues of scarcity, and scarcity naturally produces conflict and property rights as resolution, but to value property rights in and of themselves causes creation of property rights where none need be (such as copyrights and patents). It sees the right to reduce the possibility of abundance through violence, a right to form monopoly.Someone may hold wage labor as a value in and of itself and look at how to preserve it even in the face of it not being necessary. They may hold employment as tantamount and forget unemployment includes retirement and in so pursuing the increase in employment also destroy possibility of early retirement. They don't see the natural value of wage labor, of employment and create artificial necessity of employment.This can be seen as speculative value over natural or real or intrinsic value. A bubble where something is valuable in and of itself, like the housing bubble.This can be thought of as being anti-life, as peoples own natural value diminishes in the face of automation, that we should preserve a world where the value of our time is highest. To value being human in and of itself. But this ignores transformation of humanity, the longevity of life, an abundance more time, the ability to create virtual worlds where we can taste being human again. To cling to being human in and of itself is to deny this transformation.

3he43y	-12846	1439862411	Anarcho_Capitalism	Glass-Steagall and the financial crisis	I'm actually shocked that there appears to be ignorance among a few ancaps here on this sub regarding the role of Glass-Steagall and the financial crisis. Let me try to enlighten you with this [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall:_Aftermath_of_repeal#Glass.E2.80.93Steagall_.E2.80.9Crepeal.E2.80.9D_and_the_financial_crisis):&gt; Lawrence White and Jerry Markham rejected these claims and argued that **products linked to the financial crisis were not regulated by Glass–Steagall** or were available from commercial banks or their affiliates before the GLBA repealed Glass–Steagall sections 20 and 32. Alan Blinder wrote in 2009 that he had **“yet to hear a good answer” to the question “what bad practices would have been prevented if Glass–Steagall was still on the books?”** Blinder argued that “disgraceful” mortgage underwriting standards “did not rely on any new GLB powers,” that “free-standing investment banks” not the “banking-securities conglomerates” permitted by the GLBA were the major producers of “dodgy MBS,” and that he **could not “see how this crisis would have been any milder if GLB had never passed.”** Similarly, Melanie Fein has written that **the financial crisis “was not a result of the GLBA” and that the “GLBA did not authorize any securities activities that were the cause of the financial crisis.”** Fein noted **“[s]ecuritization was not an activity authorized by the GLBA but instead had been held by the courts in 1990 to be part of the business of banking rather than an activity proscribed by the Glass–Steagall Act."** As described above, in 1978 the OCC approved a national bank securitizing residential mortgages.&gt; Carl Felsenfeld and David L. Glass wrote that “[t]he public—which for this purpose includes most of the members of Congress” does not understand that the investment banks and other “shadow banking” firms that experienced “runs” precipitating the financial crisis (i.e., AIG, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch) **never became “financial holding companies” under the GLBA and, therefore, never exercised any new powers available through Glass–Steagall “repeal.”** They joined Jonathan R. Macey and Peter J. Wallison in noting many GLBA critics do not understand that Glass–Steagall’s restrictions on banks (i.e., Sections 16 and 21) remained in effect and that the GLBA only repealed the affiliation provisions in Sections 20 and 32. The American Bankers Association, former President Bill Clinton, and others have argued that **the GLBA permission for affiliations between securities and commercial banking firms “helped to mitigate” or “softened” the financial crisis** by permitting bank holding companies to acquire troubled securities firms or such troubled firms to convert into bank holding companies.&gt; &gt; Martin Mayer argued there were “three reasonable arguments” for tying Glass–Steagall repeal to the financial crisis: (1) it invited banks to enter risks they did not understand; (2) it created “network integration” that increased contagion; and (3) it joined the incompatible businesses of commercial and investment banking. Mayer, however, then **described banking developments in the 1970s and 1980s that had already established these conditions before the GLBA repealed Sections 20 and 32.** Mayer’s 1974 book The Bankers detailed the “revolution in banking” that followed Citibank establishing a liquid secondary market in “negotiable certificates of deposit” in 1961. This new “liability management” permitted banks to fund their activities through the “capital markets,” like nonbank lenders in the “shadow banking market,” rather than through the traditional regulated bank deposit market envisioned by the 1933 Banking Act. In 1973 Sherman J. Maisel wrote of his time on the Federal Reserve Board and described how “[t]he banking system today is far different from what it was even in 1960” as “formerly little used instruments” were used in the “money markets” and “turned out to be extremely volatile.”&gt; &gt; In describing the “transformation of the U.S. financial services industry” from 1975-2000 (i.e., from after the “revolution in banking” described by Mayer in 1974 to the effective date of the GLBA), Arthur Wilmarth described how during the 1990s, despite remaining bank holding companies, J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. and Bankers Trust “built financial profiles similar to securities firms with a heavy emphasis on trading and investments.” In 1993, Helen Garten described the transformation of the same companies into “wholesale banks” similar to European “universal banks.”&gt;&gt; Jan Kregel agrees that “multifunction” banks are a source for financial crises, but he argues the “basic principles” of Glass–Steagall “were eviscerated even before” the GLBA. **Kregel describes Glass–Steagall as creating a “monopoly that was doomed to fail” because after World War II nonbanks were permitted to use “capital market activities” to duplicate more cheaply the deposit and commercial loan products for which Glass–Steagall had sought to provide a bank monopoly.**So a lot of bad stuff happened before the "repeal" of Glass-Steagall, but even if we can say that the financial crisis would have still happened if they did not repeal those sections of the Glass-Steagall, they still have an argument:&gt; While accepting that **under Glass–Steagall financial firms could still have “made, sold, and securitized risky mortgages, all the while fueling a massive housing bubble and building a highly leveraged, Ponzi-like pyramid of derivatives on top,”** the New Rules Project concludes that commentators who deny the GLBA played a role in the financial crisis “fail to recognize the significance of 1999 as the pivotal policy-making moment leading up to the crash.” **The Project argues 1999 was Congress’s opportunity to reject 25 years of “deregulation” and “confront the changing financial system by reaffirming the importance of effective structural safeguards, such as the Glass–Steagall Act's firewall and market share caps to limit the size of banks; bringing shadow banks into the regulatory framework; and developing new rules to control the dangers inherent in derivatives and other engineered financial products.”**So basically, their argument isn't that some specific deregulation was the problem (such as the "repeal" of Glass-Steagall) but that they should have updated the regulations to deal with the changes to the financial system.I say, maybe there is an argument there for more regulation, after all AnarchoCaptalist are not against regulation they just don't think the state will do them right in the long term.

Lady Gaga has 41.1 million followers on Twitter.Mr. Hwang said Crayon Pop’s act will last about 30 minutes. The girls will do the popular “Bar Bar Bar” song, where they jump up and down in a straight line mimicking the movements of a five cylinder engine. The group will also perform its soon-to-be-released song, “Uh-ee.”from [WSJ](http://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/03/21/crayon-pop-to-open-for-lady-gaga/)

So I asked Siri to rename me as such. I work with my SO in construction management. She looks in her inbox to a forwarded conversation between myself and several other companies. To her surprise the first name on the recipients list is "Mr. Big Dick". Now I wait to see the damage.

1nxwsn	-12869	1381185646	chemistry	Synthesizing bromine with the following procedure. Possible?	NaBr + NaHSO4 &gt; HBr + Na2SO4 ??? or NaBr + NaHSO4 &gt; Br2 + Na2SO4 ?I did a reaction with KI + NaHSO4 and I added the solution to hydrogen peroxide which gave me iodine, and I want to get some Bromine next and I was wondering if it would work the same way.Also how much bromine gets dissolved in water? If I was to do this, let it settle and extract the bromine with a separatory funnel, would I pretty much have a 99% pure sample?

1q0cfq	-12869	1383716820	chemistry	Weird reaction going on.. I need help understanding this.	Ok so a few days ago I had a 150 ml solution with 75 grams of NaOH dissolved in it so I decided to react all of it with aluminum so I went ahead and did it until no more aluminum wasnt being reacted in the solution. I filtered it out and boiled the clear solution and it left me a white goo under my beaker:http://i40.tinypic.com/2my9fu8.jpgSo i took a bit of this and placed it in a cup, added some water to it and added a small amount of potass permanganate to it and the solution turned to pink like usual:http://i43.tinypic.com/20gn09g.jpgAfterwards out of curiousity I added a bit of 70% isopropyl alcohol to it and I noticed that the solution got kinda dark and after a minute it turned to this beautiful green color:http://i40.tinypic.com/n3xavq.jpganyone got a clue on what is going on?

Is that correct? If I let the solution run for an extra 10 minutes will my yields suffer?

1e1ccz	-12873	1368144849	microgrowery	Droopy leaves despite stable environmental factors	I am currently growing three strains:* Atomic Northern Lights (23 days into veg)* Blueberry (4 days into veg)* Trainwreck (4 days into veg)These plants are all under a 600w MH bulb on an 18/6 light cycle in a 4x4x7 tent. The tent has a 6" fan running at roughly 300 cfm 24/7 along with smaller oscillating fans.I recently setup a webcam in my tent to make a timelapse of the growing plants. After three days of recording, I've noticed that my plants droop their leaves at the exact same time every day. The droop always happens around hour 15-17 of the 18 hour light cycle which corresponds to roughly 12-2pm. Take a look here: https://vimeo.com/65863817 and here: https://vimeo.com/65802134At first I thought it had to do with watering so I watered one set of plants and not the other but despite this both sets of plants still drooped at the same time. Also, one set of plants is getting nutrients while the other set is not.Next I thought it was temperature or humidity, so I repositioned the thermometer/hygrometer in front of the webcam and put a heater in the tent. The heater kept the temperature between 77^o F and 81^o F and the humidifier kept the humidity between 41% and 54%. Despite these two factors being stabilized, both sets of plants still drooped their leaves at the exact same time.The only factors I haven't controlled for are water pH and ppm, but based on my understanding neither of these factors are very important when growing in soil, especially if my leaves appear to be a healthy green which they all are.**Does anyone have a guess as to why my plants are drooping and whether I should be attempting to correct the droop?**

I don't know who created it, but I appreciate their work. If you read this, thank you for making it available.I wanted this flag to look official, as much like the real thing as possible. Finding the correct font proved impossible so I chose a close relative of the original. The bear is slightly different too because it appears to be based on a vector model. The leaf also bothers me a bit because it has fine detail which you can see when zoomed in. If I had more energy I'd simplify that shape down to a single shaded outline of the same leaf, much like the red star on the real flag.If you want to play around with this design, here is the Photoshop file: https://mega.co.nz/#!K4xRBQqI!HlzvEw6FmK9pEwYID5atwwmmIt5eiMzGCfplnW7XHPwAnd here is the font used in the Photoshop file: http://www.dafont.com/typomoderno.font

It would make zero difference to me if he quit tomorrow.* The Rock right now is better on the mic than almost everyone on the roster not named CM Punk. Does he pander and get "cheap pops" sure, but I don't know a single guy in the WWE that hasn't done something "cheap" to get a reaction. For a guy that was out of the game for so long, he's good.* I'd be happy never seeing Triple H wrestle again.* Wade Barrett is a bore (side note: I actually like wasteland)* Christian is a bore.A few months ago I would have included Cesaro as his character or presence had not impressed me but I've since turned around on him. Dat strength.

As a lifetime Laker fan, I've never felt like a fan of another team - but I have a soft spot for **The Bucks**. Their fans have been the nicest I've interacted with and I used to really like Michael Redd. If they turn out to be the best team in the East some day, I'd be cool with that. Similar reasons for liking **The Raptors** they've had some interesting franchise players over the years, cool fans, no beef at all with their team and seen enough of their games over the years to just like them.

2bupzj	-12882	1406462624	TheDarkTower	The fun has ended (major spoilers)	About halfway through DT7, no further spoilers please.Jake just died. At least I can take solace in the fact that his death meant something and even the artistic way of his first death being the same as his last. Eddie's meanwhile meant nothing, there was no reason for it and I can't think of any way that it's a meaningful end.  I've been vaguely aware of how the series ends (no confirmation please!) and how ka is like a wheel. How this series is the antithesis of resolution. But now, riding back to New York to talk to the Tet Corporation and riding a train to Fedic, I'm completely disheartened. Partly because the journey is almost over and I don't know if I'll ever find any series I've enjoyed as much and partly because I'm sad about how things are playing out. I'm reading much slower now, I don't want to get to the last deaths and last unsatisfying resolutions.  I don't really have a question or anything, I just wanted to share.

Which is kind of meta actually considering Chip is subconsciously modeled after Opie. Also, the laugh is just reusing his Roland laugh.

I wasn't quite sure of the connection between the roses horn sound and the actual horn.I mean this next cycle is supposed to pick up at the dessert, not at the beginning (when things could be alright). So how are things different? Maybe he subconsciously would remember if he was sent back to Jericho Hill, but he wasnt.

He honed his skills there before returning to WBAB to be closer to his family, according to friends.Hughes is clean-cut and blond with a guileless smile and a hearty, helpless laugh. &gt;Former employers described him as "talented and able to really .connect with listeners.” They also said he was successful before meeting Cumia, now 41, an inspired mimic and master of song parodies.([source](http://www.newsday.com/lifestyle/drive-time-ambition-ratings-and-money-push-radio-jocks-toward-the-edge-1.396278) its a shitty link that makes you answer a question on the right to see the article,but it's the only copy around)

2u0d3r	-12882	1422481838	opieandanthony	I have not missed an episode of O&amp;J until this week	Yes Opie's insufferable but I was able to get a decent listen out of Jimmy and the guests making me laugh, Sam subtly shitting on him, and even sometimes it was fun to hate Opie. It was nothing great, but something to put on in the background at work. But the hours of fucking storm talk (he admitted today he didn't really care and was just trying to fill time, which makes it all the worse) is completely unbearable. Easily the worst radio I've ever fucking heard, it's up there with the Todd's and Terry Cliffords of the world. It was like torture, I'm done. Die, jelly tits.

Were those shows not big ppv events and just specials? I see new beginning is on the 11th and 14th - what's the deal with that? Will JR and Stryker be doing another show? Have I missed any important developments since WK9?Also, other than the show on axs tv, which is nothing but replays of old matches, is there a weekly show with a continuing narrative or is that just the PPVs?

2zzmz3	-12882	1427094730	SquaredCircle	My first house show. Report 3/22/15 - Ontario, CA	**Dolph Ziggler vs Luke Harper**  Dolph was over as fuck, of course. Luke was surprisingly hilarious and charismatic when allowed, he was taunt stealing and gyrating like Ziggler. Drop kick fest from Dolph, back and forward opener match. That gum spitting trick wrestlers do when they get super kicked is quite effective as everyone thought Ziggler lost a tooth. Dolph won with the Zig-Zag.**Tyler Breeze vs Finn Balor**  I fucking lost my shit when I realized Balor was coming out. Slightly disappointing they didn't get his entrance with the lights going on as he releases the doves but oh well. Looks like the casual house show crowd had no idea who either guy was but Breeze got on the mic and did his shtick, got over fairly quickly. Bunch of uggos! Lot's of irish whips and reversals, actually looked like they were going basic which is understandable. Balor wins with his top rope stomp, looks so sick in person.**Summer Rae/Cameon/Sasha Banks vs Nattie/Emma/Naomi**Not much to say as it was a slight bit of a cluster fuck. Nattie was easily the most over of them all. The heels got booed when they came out, and the faces got cheered but only Nattie got a chant going for her. She won with the sharpshooter.**Miz vs Jimmy Uso**Mizdow came out with Miz, Miz addressed the fact that why is Mizdow out here after raw? Well, he'd be fired from the WWE if he wasn't. I'm sure that won't be what they go with on Raw, sounded like a quick little excuse so they could do their thing. Miz gave him a chair to go sit down, teased Mizdow hitting him with a chair but he didn't. Jimmy was dancing around, kind of turned into an impromptu dance off, man does the WWE love this shit for live events. Anyway Mizdow with the distraction causing Jimmy to win. The two celebrate afterwards together.**Roman vs Bray**Roman was over, pretty much every other adult in there was with a kid and they ate him up. A few scattered boos here and there, including from me. Bray had a pre match promo talking about taking out all of the WWE's heroes, tonight it would be Roman next week it would be Undertaker. Roman doing the same 3 things he always does. Nothing else to see here. Also Bray has sick presence in person. When Roman came by to my section (floor, to the left of the entrance) I got to boo him and throw my thumbs down. He gave me an annoyed smirk as I was the only one in my section shitting up his fun. Good times.**Axlemania and The One Man Band Bay-Bay vs Los Matadores**Was the piss break match but I dug it, Axle did some Hulk Hogan stuff and kicked El Torito in the ass which I popped for. Ended with Torito causing a distraction to Axle and getting rolled up.**Wade Barrett Vs Dean Ambrose for the IC Title (lol, sure)**Wade cut his usual BNB promo, got quite the boo'ing. Deano came out to probably the second biggest pop of the night. But by this point the crowd was starting to get really blown up and weren't very into this. One sweet spot was Dean doing the caught-in-the-ropes lariat to a reversal wasteland. Wade tries to leave after a while, Dean throws him back in and gets kicked in the balls. Dean wins by DQ. Dirty deeds post match.**Daniel vs Kane - street fight**Daniel was over from the point I got in line to get into the building to the very end, YES chants all over the place. Everybody was ecstatic to see him, yes chants for just about everything he did. Big pop for taking out the tables, Daniel laid down Kane and went to the top rope. Kane got up, Daniel was going to go for a head butt but changed up to a axe handle smash but was caught in a chokeslam position and got put through the table. Kicked out, thew Kane a chair and did the running knee for the win. Yes's everywhars.**Top 5 cheers:**  1. Daniel  2. Roman  3. Dean  4. Dolph  5. Mizdow  **Top 5 boo's:**  1. Kane    2. Miz  3. Bray  4. Wade  5. Luke

So true. Was SO funny when that guy called Stangal and was like "hey thanks man, just wanna figure out the guy who didnt corroborate my sto- YOU'RE THE GUY?!". Hohooo he got the wrong list did he?This was like 10 minutes after the awful fake suicidal Australian story. 
385v3g	-12882	1433209916	opieandanthony	How the fuck does Opie spend his days?	Considering he "works" 12 hour weeks, has a maid, a nanny and a stay at home retard. He is also completely ill informed in all topics of news, pop-culture or media. He hasn't even seen Game Of Thrones or Breaking Bad after the whole country did. What about sports? Nope, not watching shit even though he claims to be a big sports fan (he's all in with the knicks and mma, even though all he knows is Carmello and a half dozen fighters that have been on his show).What the fuck does a non contributing member of society with zero interests do to pass the day? Especially when they make an effort to avoid all interests and hobbies of regular human beings.

Uncle Paul having carte blanche on making Hitler and Mussolini baby rape jokes. Jim was cracking me up throughout. And then the last hour or so with Chyna/Xpac was compelling. Sherrod even cracked me up once or twice. Tits stayed out of the way for the most part.

3fi18q	-12882	1438515299	SquaredCircle	Recap of last nights house show in Ontario	[Quick pic from the event](http://i.imgur.com/9rZS2D2.jpg)   Edit: Ontario, California to be more specific.**10 bell salute for Hot Rod****-First KO comes out**   to mock Cena for taking the night off. KO wrestled the night after breaking his nose and Cenas not here after 5 days? Heels it up a bit by shitting on people with KO shirts. Lil Naitch is gonna raise his arm when BREAK THE WALLS DOOOOOWN. Fuckin Jericho. He steals Kevins mic, does his stuff, KO gets another mic and says he shouldn't be doing double duty tonight. Jericho snatches the second one and talks with both mics. After Kevin grabs a third mic, Jericho bonks him with his two mics. Cage match main event set.-**Bellas over Naomi and Sasha Banks**    in a sloppy and forgettable match. Sasha deserved more. -**Neville over Bo**   after a red arrow, one of their basic matches they've done with each other before. As well as I know the match, it was really hype seeing it live as Neville and Bo play their roles awesome.-**Cesaro over King Barrett**  after a swing-shooter, Cesaro was over as fuck. #2 behind Y2J. There was a neat little spot where near the barricade Cesaro set up a chair and uppercut Barret into it in a sitting position, Cesaro goes back and does a jumping uppercut sending Barret into the barriers.  Crowd chants one more time, I really like that they gave it to us but didnt make Wade look like a dope as he didnt fall for it again moving out of the way. Anyway great back and forward match. He became my girls favorite before he left the ring.-**PTP over New Day**   Standard tag match here, new day is hilarious live and Titus was pretty over. Woods grabbed a fans TRICP MEAT sign, paraded it around for a while and before returning it to the fan, he ripped it up. Top lels.-**Rusev with Summer over R-Truth**   with the accolade. We want Lana chants, Summer milked it. Lana came out and I was almost too distracted by her silky white panties (:3!) to notice she botched the one thing she had to do all night which was slap summer, she was off by a mile. Russev and Truth meanwhile put on a surprisingly stiff underdog in peril match. **-MizTV**   even though were not on TV. But Miz said it was to honor Pipers Pit. Did his usual hateable stuff. Show came out, KO'd him. As apparently the usual, Show is cheered at house shows. Was kind of interesting as he played the face to the crowd slapping hands and stuff. But there was this moment he looked into the crowd and gave a "HUR HUR IM RETARDED" wave, I feel like it was the big show character making a reference to how he hates being the smiling dope. Just a lil something for those of us in the crowd confused as to why hes the face. Or maybe im reading into it too much.-**Chris Jericho over KO**   after a codebreaker. The crowd was totally blown up by this point. KO refused to enter the ring to start the match, just some vintage Kevin stuff. They get all their signature spots in (except for the pop up powerbomb :( which was reversed when Jericho jumped out of his hands) even a good ol Jericho cocky pin [BAY-BAY](http://i.imgur.com/eMAWPoz.jpg). They tossed each other into the cage a couple times, teased escape from the top. Jericho got him in a Walls, Owens crawls to the door and gets pulled back and they role out of the move back into the match.  I felt like it was a tiny match but it was about 15 (after the Kevin pussyfooting about) went by super quick. I was ready to cheer for KO over anyone but god damn was I star struck by that million dollar Jericho smile.[Here's a potato quality pic of the personality of the match.](http://i.imgur.com/rEyWml5.jpg)Good show.

udsyb	-12896	1338469945	FanTheories	Fringe and Doctor Who both have the same alternate universe.	In season 2, episodes 12 and 13, Army of Ghosts and Doomsday of Doctor Who, the Doctor and Rose accidentally travel to an alternate universe where, among other things, [Airships/Zeppelins](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_rw7bI8eIgMw/TSun1AjPiQI/AAAAAAAAAPY/vV-xW8nONAM/s1600/500x_800px-pete_s_world.jpg) are still in use. In Fringe, where the whole show revolves around the relationship with an alternate universe/world, the other side also uses [Airships](http://onceuponatime.jaedia.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/fringeAirship.jpg).Either they are the same universe, or they both have the same alternate universe. [There is even the theory that sci-fi shows all use the same one.](http://nimave.blogspot.com/2011/01/zeppelins-in-alternate-realities.html)

Lee Majors saves christmas, in "The Day The Reindeer Died", this is the same kind of wackiness that was on U62, only more high-class, with an aging, classic TV star, Lee Majors. Lew Hayward, Frank Cross' old partner is the son of either Bob, whose last name was not known in the movie, or George Newman's son, with a changed last name.  Lew Hayward is is a product of the success that befell U62 once they defeated the "Network" that was run by RJ Fletcher.I know it isn't much, but it was a moment inspiration.

We just watched The Time of Angels and Flesh and Stone, and after I had put her to bed she comes out a few minutes later and says the thing that every Whovian parent secret wants to hear "Daddy, I can't sleep because of the Weeping Angels".   That was my moment.  I went into my closet, dug around and found an old toy I had gotten as a birthday present, my Tennant-era Sonic Screwdriver.  Even with dead batteries, she was thrilled and went right to bed.  Fantastic. Allons-y. Geronimo.

2kk4tv	-12910	1414495686	jailbreak	apple tv 1 with no remote jailbreaking help	so I scored an old Apple TV one from my buddy this weekend for the sole purpose to jailbreak it.  I've never owned an Apple TV so I've never done any research on how to jailbreak it so I have no idea where to start even tho I have jailbroken every iPhone I've ever owned and I have a MacBook.  so that's basically my n00b problem, my main problem is the remote didn't come with the Apple TV I purchased.  My roommate has the newer Apple TV aluminum remote but I can't seem to get that to work with the old Apple TV.  Pretty much I have this older Apple TV and I have no idea how to get it to even start to work, then I can worry about this jailbreaking process.any info and ideas or suggestions will be helpful, thanks in advance

Feel free to critique, add, subtract, or correct anything in my rant. I just had to get it off of my chest, so I typed it out and decided to copy and paste it here....Dear Republicans:How can you claim to be for small government, but want the government to micromanage the lives of others? How can you claim to be for freedom and liberty, yet be against recreational drug use, gay marriage, and for a criminal justice system that rules with an iron fist? How can you be the party of freedom but try to force religious ideology upon people? How can you constantly claim to be upholding the constitution while trying to smack down net neutrality; and impose “Christian values”? How can the spending trillions upon trillions on wars and supplying law enforcement with military weapons and equipment be considered fine, but be so adamantly against spending for healthcare, feeding the homeless, or helping people find shelter? How can you be pro-life but leave people to die from lack of adequate housing, nutrition, and medical care? “Liberals preach tolerance but jump down my throat for having an opinion. That’s not very tolerant”That argument is a fallacy. You are intolerant towards large generalized groups of people whose rights you wish to deny but who are not infringing on yours. I am not trying to preach “tolerance”. You can hate who you want. However, you want to act on your hate and infringe on others, promoting inequality in liberty and freedom. You want to selectively deny the rights (not privileges, rights) of people you disagree with and accuse us “libtards” of being intolerant because we stand up for equality. I am not against you having an opinion. I am against what you are trying to achieve based on your opinion. I recognize your right to an opinion and just because we are in disagreement does not mean I want to deny you any rights, constitutional or otherwise. But you want to use your prejudice as a means to deny American citizens equal rights. If taking a stand against that is “intolerant” then I am proud to be so.Don’t agree with gay marriage? Don’t get one.Don’t agree with Muslimism? Don’t be a Muslim.So many conservatives talk about the 2nd amendment being a “constitutional right” but ignore the infringement of the 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, 9th, and 10th amendments when it comes to people whose religions or sexual orientation differ from theirs.How about we simplify everything with one single law:"Do whatever you want as long as it does not interfere with another living person's right to do the same."I am pretty sure that sentence alone could serve as a guideline for whether or not someone is actually doing anything "wrong".

31btef	-12921	1428080677	USPS	Registered mail being routed pretty far out of the way	I have been very eagerly awaiting a piece of registered mail from an international shipper. I finally saw an update on the tracking that it was in a neighboring city. Historically when I have tracked items, within a few hours of landing in that city, it leaves and ends up at my local post office for delivery with the next day's mail.This package, however, did not have any tracking updates for about 2 days and the next tracking update shows the item 160 miles away (it was only 30 before). The "Expected Delivery" date was also not on the tracking page until today and it shows today's date and "On Time". I have my doubts that it will be delivered today since the package is showing as so far away. Since this is registered mail, though, I know that I need to be home to sign for the item.Is it possible there is an error in the tracking, or is it more likely that my package is taking a tour of my state before arriving at my door?

If *someone* were to save over $10,000 in change over the course of a few years and then decided to deposit that into their bank account, would it be subject to tax?From what I understand, deposits of this size need to be reported by the bank, but since the cash is made up of change that had already been taxed as it was earned over the years I am wondering what you would have to do to avoid having it taxed.

But they have to be feasible.Supernatural horror movies just don't do it for me any more. Is it the same for anyone else?EDIT: someone commented, but deleted it....

I can get excited with people flying and be thrilled with unnatural occurances, but for a movie to disturb me after the credits roll, and keep me up at night, it has to be feasible.

I wanted to post this in the "No Stupid Questions" thread, but I saw something shiny yesterday and got distracted.Anyway, I have a PA with a 16 channel mixer that I use for my 5 piece band. I was given a 2 channel Phonic compressor. Currently, everyone in the band does at least some vocal work. From what I have read, it is best to use compression on the channel insert rather than the main L/R inserts or the effects aux. My question is, do I need to acquire a couple more compressors in order to apply compression to everyone? My goal with the compression is to help "normalize" volume levels and reduce noise. Any input is appreciated.

At Penny's two year check up the vet informed me that her teeth look pretty bad; no permanent damage since she's so young but we are bringing her in for a cleaning tomorrow. The vet thinks I will either have to brush Penny's teeth daily (of course she hates it) or have a yearly cleaning (which means yearly anesthesia) and I was just curious if this has been anyone else's experience? I'm not surprised, I know Shih Tzus are likely to have bad teeth. I am just wondering if you all brush your pup's teeth and how often or if you get them cleaned how often and have you incurred very many high cost dentals due to bigger issues? Or if your pup is older how are their teeth and how do you care for them?

2i3d3f	-12942	1412260447	civ	Where has my mods folder gone?	So all my mods disappeared a couple of weeks ago, even though i was subscribed to them, so i unsub resubbed. Didn't work. I tried to figure something out but after about 3 days of no success, i surrendered and accepted the game without mods. But lately, in the span of a week or so, i have seen multiple posts here about mods disappearing, and one often said thing to do was to check the "MODS" folder in your Civ 5 game files. I decided to take a look at it, in the hopes of fixing my mod problem. but then i realized, there was no "MODS" folder, not in any other folder, subfolder etc. (here's a screenshot of my civ 5 files for anyone wanting to see: http://imgur.com/a/xaCuz) Anyone have any ideas wtf has happened and how can i fix this?

1wca9n	-12957	1390878801	vinyl	Turntable issue on potential buy	I'm tracking a turntable ad that says they "have to turn it up really loudly to hear it".  Is this someone unexperienced enough to just not know they need a phono plug/preamp, or is something wrong with this thing? I know I can ask the seller, but it seems like the most likely answers (to this noob) are more than the seller can answer. 
1z5eou	-12957	1393558890	vinyl	Still after my first turntable:	and what I want on craigslist is not as easily found. The only real listing I feel good about, is two hours away, and it'll be at least a week before I get to it (if the guy contacts me back). Reason I'm bugging this subreddit?  There's a very very similar model on ebay.  They suggest the platter spins and the tonearm works fine, but it doesn't make sound for 'unknown reasons' so they're saying it's as-is/ for repairs. So. What's the chance they just didn't hook it to a preamp?  or, what's the chance I'm buying a very expensive hunk of useless crap?
1zq4cd	-12957	1394120430	panthers	The Smith Rumor	So the rumor circulating right now is that the Smith/Gettleman meeting didn't go well, if you like Steve Smith as a member of this team. One version states that Smith was asked about a paycut and declined, the other just skips that and starts right off with this: Smith is to be shopped, and if not he's a June style cut (the remaining proration goes to next year). Somehow the rumor knows that NE and SD have both expressed interest.

I'm actually buying a couple things right now because of the Black Keys link (thanks BTW).  No amount of crate digging locally has given me much of anything made within the last 20 years.  So, those of you that buy somewhat recent music, how do you do it?  It's gotten so expensive.  Any tips before I go broke?  
258250	-12957	1399746738	panthers	Bene Benwikere, CB SJSU, trade up in 5th	NFL.com's Bucky Brooks wrote that San Jose State senior CB Bene Benwikere "has been garnering the most attention [amongst corners] at the East-West Shrine Game."Benwikere, 6-foot, 192-pounds, "has shown impressive movement skills, footwork and awareness covering receivers in drills" and has maintained "tight coverage on receivers out of the break and shown an aggressive knack for playing the ball," according to Brooks. The scribe believes Benwikere is best suited for a team that plays a zone-heavy scheme. "Speaking to several scouts about Benewikere, most have raved about his size, cover skills and instincts, but the prevailing concern centered on his tackling and toughness," Brooks wrote. "Some believed he didn't attack runners or receivers on the perimeter; he will need to display better courage and toughness to solidify his status as a top corner in the draft." Jan 15 - 10:09 AM
28k2lo	-12957	1403191294	madmen	Henry Francis parallel?	I'm certain I'm overthinking Henry Francis.  He's not an exceptionally developed character at this point, and they haven't shown much of a 'bad side' compared to most characters.  I was looking something up regarding Henry Kissinger, and saw he was a Rockefeller advisor (as was Henry Francis).  Now, being in politics near NY and hitching your wagon to Rockefeller isn't that exceptionally unique, but it still feels specific.  Since the Francis' houseguests during the moon landing said something about Nixon calling for Henry, I don't know.  I guess I'm wondering if they're going anywhere with Henry's aspirations here in the last few episodes, or if he's just a stock character that's supposed to symbolize the establishment. 
295g3n	-12957	1403792311	bourbon	Improvement in the bottle? Newbie bothers you with a question about cheap rye	Morning /r/bourbon!  Suffer this fool for a moment. I've been into bourbon for a few months.  First, thanks to so many of you, as reading reviews before trying new things has dialed in what I like (at least, as far as what to buy on the Bulleit-level of the shelf and the one below it), and the reviews have helped me understand a bit on what I'm tasting, too.  I've judged beer before so I have a little knowledge, but bourbon is a whole other animal.  Subreddit even helped me score a bottle of ECBP based on a tip(#4 - I have yet to pop it but have an occasion, soon). So, again, thanks.  I try to upvote anything that's helpful but otherwise, I try to stay out of the way. Anyway, I'd bought a bottle of Beam Rye as my first rye, while I was still on the "I'm going to try Evan Black/BiB" end of the kick, before things started to get more expensive.  I live in a controlled state (NC - fuck you ABC) so nothing is truly 'cheap'. Anyway, beam rye.  It was OK, a first try at it.  Good mixer, but a little tougher to drink without at least ice.   Knocked down most of the bottle over a few months, didn't revisit it. But I had about 3 oz left last night, knocked it out, and it had gotten better. Meandering BS above distilled down into my question.  Did air, even possibly sun oxidation improve this cheap rye?  Or did my palate change somehow by having better bourbon than that?

2edel7	-12957	1408809285	panthers	Brandon LaFell	after having Brandon LaFell shoved down my throat by the media and some fans, as if he was a big loss - and then against a secondary that gave up big plays and honestly underperformed, LaFell got all the good targets with the 1s before Amendola and Edelman (which, honestly, Brady throwing to those two in the 3rd quarter of any meaningless game seems short-sighted), and finished with 2 for 14. LaFell got 3 of Brady's first five targets and a total of 8 on the night, including penalty, and caught 2. For 14 yards. He outright dropped a couple, big surprise.Kelvin Benjamin caught about 20 yards of stuff on Revis and walked away with 3 times the total production on fewer targets, on a night where seemingly everything went right for the Pats and nothing right for Carolina.  I know the equation was never whether KB was more talented than LaFell, they never played the same role, but it's refreshing to have a big man that will go get a ball.
2emun0	-12957	1409067099	buildapc	[Build Help] Leftover Parts And No Cash	Good morning!  Thanks for reading/helping.  I've been out of the game for years.  I lost my built PC to a nursery, was stuck on a laptop for years, when I tried to boot it after time in rest, it kinda gave up the ghost, and then the wife bought a slimline PC that we've been using.  And it meets most needs, sure.  *But I want back in.* So, here's what I have, in dusty but obviously cleanable condition:* An ATX case I can't ID that should be big enough for anything* a 480W PS* A Patriot 32GB SSD I was given, never used* 3x 180GB HDDs, all old but gently used * An x800 video card that has to be, what, a decade old?* Two VGA monitors I'd like to use together* motherboard/CPU/RAM I would rightly assume have no business in a new buildSo, to get to a point: I assume a case is a case.  I have to troubleshoot the PS (which I'm going to assume is as simple as "see if it turns on" since there's no point in troubleshooting the full, unusable setup) and ensure it, too, is usable, but I'm guessing I have enough power and that it being not-new is OK. I assume the video card is essentially less than I'd get from onboard. I'm OK with modest storage space for now.  I've never worked with a SSD and I dig that the 32 is small, but OK to proceed there?  I assume I'll find an inexpensive but somewhat powerful CPU/RAM/motherboard combo that's in the neighborhood of quadcore 3ghz/4gb RAM and enough video to be equivalent to a cheap 512MB or 1GB card, which might get upgraded eventually.  Suggestions somewhat welcome ($200 seems to be what I can get away with, maybe more than I have since I'm buying an OS too) but secondary to whether I can get away with some of my existing parts. So, am I going to find it that simple (stuff the key components in, buy OS)?  Or, am I screwed and about to scrap this idea? (TL:DR - I have a small SSD and an old case/CPU, am I in business with that or not?)(edited in SSD brand name)

Just compost directly in the soil, throw whatever organic matter in I have.  As well, is it appropriate to throw in the remains of the plants that have died?  Tomatoes, vine plants, etc. I have peppers still holding on in the cold, and who knows, I might go cabbage or something in the winter (tips?), but at least two of the boxes are about to be put away for the offseason.

First pour out of a new bottle in celebration.Low light, live Avett Brothers playing in the background. Chvrches, Sam Quinn, it takes me a while to write thoughtfully.**choice: Old Weller 107.**  I've always tended toward high rye, this is my first knowing taste of a wheater.  $26.**glass**: rocks, with, uhh, a little ice.  Sue me, I haven't had anything in a month and this has to last. **Color** - bourbon.  I hesitate to say much differently in reviews, I guess.  This never seems to change, this isn't scotch, right? **Nose:** Caramel, vanilla. English biscuit malt (I'm a brewer, now and again), ethanol. Maybe white pepper?**Taste:** lingering, but not thick, cinnamon. Vanilla, maybe vanilla chai, maybe unsweetened chai macaron.  Definitely a lighter spice than I'm used to, more banana pepper or even bell, the burn is quite mild and comes with a refreshing undertone. **Finish**: clean alcohol burn. The cinnamon lingers, I keep hesitating to mention the wheat, because I know it's there, but I know it's also on my mind.  I get the wheaty parts of an unfiltered weizen, but not the yeast notes.  I'll have to get used to that. Note: my second review was in a community review of Rittenhouse Rye BiB.   Wasn't sure if I should've posted it separately, later, chose not to do so.

Next thing the adhesive between the LCD and the top layer starts coming off.I go to the repair center, and they straight off told me no warranty because the adhesive is loose.

25aqke	-12974	1399834844	tattoos	A few questions	Hi,I tried searching for answers but I couldn't really find what I was looking for.I've been considering a small-ish tattoo somewhere, and while I really like visible tattoos, I'm kind of worried about the social implications.Especially how it will affect my career or job possibilities.Mind you, I'm still young and have no career to speak of, but still.It's not so much to motif, but the location due to the aforementioned reason.Also, what are some locations that aren't really ideal for weight change?I'm a little overweight and currently losing some pretty fast, and I'd not prefer for my tattoo to look like garbage when I'm done.So, on the other side I'd like if the tattoo was visible, but on the other I would like to hide it for specific reasons (like work related, people have prejudices)Any experiences you have are appreciated!

Hey,getting my first tattoo and I only really have one last worry, and that is how I can make sure my tattooist doesn't go to deep etc?I found an artist at a shop that is not in any way super popular or anything but looks fine in my opinion, I also think the artist might be new-ish to tattooing, (though her work looks good and I like it) so I'm kind of worried that it will be fine for the first few years but will look like crap later.Any tips?I couldn't find anything but 300 facebook reviews (mostly with none or pretty short comments) on the studio, but they were all positive.
2joxr8	-12974	1413728583	Songwriters	Getting into songwriting	Hey, been playing a lot more guitar lately and I'd really like to get into songwriting, but I think I'm approaching it the wrong way.First of all, I've never really even tried to compose anything myself, because usually it just doesn't sound good enough to me, my technique though is good. It's just that there's no connection with my guitar somehow, I don't know how to improvise.I only know a few scales (and not even all positions) and I've forgotten most of the music theory I've learned.How do you guys go about this stuff?Is there a sequence I can follow to make it easier; do I start with a riff, chord progression or a melody? or maybe I should start with the theoretical basics?Also, I mostly play metal/death metal stuff if that matters.

I'm trying to cover a metal song and I've been using ableton live 9 with guitar rig and cabinet impulses for sound, and while it sounds great for practice etc. when I play my 2 guitar parts it sounds way too direct, not like a studio recording. I couldn't find any useful guides on how to make the guitars sound right, especially how I should mix them together (left/right channel). Any tips? 
2k5fyf	-12974	1414110860	audioengineering	Recording guitar	Hey, I'm recording a song cover and I'm having some issues with mixing, especially I've noticed that I've got some clipping, but the rendered file is low on volume.I was thinking maybe my guitar has too high of an input since it's plugged directly into my soundcard and it has active pickups (more output). How should the 100% raw guitar sound like and look like in wave form?¨Are there any good basic guides on mixing/recording songs (distorted guitar) you can recommend?
2k9rq9	-12974	1414222860	audioengineering	Video guides for mixing songs/instruments	Hey, I just recently posted about recording guitar and got some great responses from you guys. I actually managed to fix my issues by using an emu 1212m instead of my Xonar St mic in. I've been playing around with reaper and trying to figure things out. I'm at the point where I think I've got the basics for starting mixing and such. What I'm looking for though, is a guide that would walk through mixing a complete song from drums, bass to guitar. This is what I'm struggling with, I just can't get it to sound right, maybe I'm missing some plug-ins (or the reaper included ones just don't cut it)? I don't think so though. I realize it's all subjective and all but just to give me an idea or a guideline for starters. Thanks

2rm909	-12974	1420627416	buildapc	Build for recording/simple mixing	So my pc finally gave itself up (processor) and it's time for an upgrade. Basically I just need a motherboard and cpu because, everything else is pretty new (ssd, ram, got 2 gpus laying around etc). It is confirmed the cpu is at fault. What I'm trying to achieve is an optimal system to use with my scarlett solo (USB audio interface) . What will I need it for? For small song projects involving recording and mixing songs I've written with some VST instruments for bass/drums and synth. My main concern is achieving a low recording latency with amplitube 3 VST, but I don't know what I'm aiming for without going overkill, I'm not a professional it's just for hobby use! I was thinking about the asrock h97 fatal1ty performance (I know it labeled "gaming") because it seems to get decent dpc latency and it has the required expansion slots I possibly need (emu 1212m and Xonar St for starters). Just wondering what cpu to go with, i5/xeon? Do I need hyperthreading, does reaper support it and what are the practical benefits for my use? Motherboard link: http://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Fatal1ty%20H97%20Performance/I was thinking about the e3-1231v3 xeon but I'm not sure I need that much power because I won't be gaming anyway.

Would I then be able to use netflix and change regions? Didn't netflix say that they would disable DNS region switching though?Any help would be appreciated.

Hey, there's a shit ton of videos and guides on youtube etc. about how to properly intonate, set the action of your guitar, adjusting the truss rod... etc.What I would like to see/read is a complete guide on how to properly (i know things like action might be more of a preference) set up an electric guitar (with a floyd), where should one start, where to go next etc?I think my ltd m400 is pretty well set up, but it's been a long time since, and I would like to redo it, especially since I changed string gauge.

2uzq1o	-12974	1423236976	Guitar	Problems setting up guitar action	Hi, and sorry for posting another thread, but I figured it might be more appropriate in this case.So I watched a few guides you guys recommended, gathered all information I could and followed them step by step, but I'm having some issues.I realize some things can't be done at home properly like filing frets etc. but I'm having some issues setting up string action at the bridge with my floyd.The thing is, I currently have 2mm action at the 12th fret on both low and high e, now it's fine, and I've checked the neck relief too, it should be perfect!Now I really dig low action, but it doesn't have to be anything crazy, especially since I have a hard picking technique, but the thing is, when I lower the high e string action I don't have a full range of motion with my floyd before the strings hit the 24th fret :sAlso playing higher up around the 17/19th fret on the lower string they kind of slap against the fretboard, it's not a buzzing sound but you can really notice that the strings don't have a full range of motion and hit the frets (kind of a string slapping sound if you know what I mean), now I've tried to do a few adjustments without any real effect. For instance I tried heightening the bridge, and increasing the relief on the neck, but that didn't work out.The lower strings seem fine, I have 2mm action which is pretty low action as far as I know? But I'd like the lower strings to have a little lower action. I have a LTD m-400 by the way (08 model).Do you guys think I'm going overkill with the action or is there some adjustments I can do?Any help would be appreciated!

Okay guys, this is a long and convoluted story, but i'll try to make it succinct.  Background:  When i first got into FIT (http://www.fit.edu/)  I arrived here on a fully paid scholarship (37k a year) for 4 years.  I slept with a particular girl in my early days during my first semester here.  She turned out to be quite odd so i cut off all ties with her.  She somehow managed to sleaze her way into my inner group of friends to get closer to me.  At times i would acquiesce, give her the benefit of the doubt, and give her a chance.  She would improve with each encounter, but again, she would say or do something completely asinine that would cause me to shun her from my life.  Again, I wouldn't talk to her for weeks, and she would beg and plea, promising me that she'd correct her ways if i gave her another chance... I just couldn't take it anymore from her one day and i completely erased her from my life.  Forwarding to the summer that just past.  I am a broke motherfucker, which is the reason i got into school for free (busted my ass to get a 4.0, finished my AA within a year, etc).  But over the summer, i had no where to move to since i have no family.  My only recourse was to take summer classes so that i would be allowed to live on campus during the summer, so i did.  Now, my scholarship doesn't cover summer courses so i was in the hole and owed the school money for the upcoming fall semester and i couldn't register for classes till that was paid.  This particular girl heard about this through my friends so she contacted me with an offer.  She told me that what i could do is live with her in her dorm room so that the money that I didn't use on my own housing, i could use to pay off the summer classes.  At this point, i was desperate and had no other options, thus i accepted her offer under certain conditions.  These conditions were that she couldn't drink anymore (she had problems with getting physically violent whilst drunk and other things), and that she could not use her dorm room as leverage over me by threatening me to kick me out or call security on me if things didn't go her way (she loved to argue for no reason).I moved in, and lo and behold, every day was a trivial argument started on her part for the sake of drama.  I would always walk out when she started to raise her voice and i'd stay at the library (sometimes passing out there) till she'd text me that she had calmed down and to please come back.  This happened for approximately 30 days.  This last day, which was Sept 22nd 2012, she started to argue with me, and again raise her voice (to attract attention from neighboring roommates), so i picked up my things and left her room to go to a study lounge.  An hour later i realize i forgot my book in her room and head back.  When i knock, she had just gotten out of the shower and was completely naked.  She asks, "what do you want?" I reply "forgot my book, im getting it then leaving again."At this point she lets me in, i walk around looking for it, meanwhile she's tugging at my arm asking me why i'm leaving, to stay and talk to her.  I say that i don't have time for triviality, i have to study for an exam coming up and can't be bothered.  As i walk toward her door, she palms it holding it closed and says, "you're not leaving till we talk about what the problem is,"  "no, you already know what the problem is, let me go, i need to study," "fine, you walk out that door, don't ever come back in here!""okay, then its over, i'll call my friend so he can come here and help me pack my things."As i struggle to open the door while she's trying to hold it closed, i give it one more yank and finally free myself.  I make it to the furthest exit of her floor, and once i reach it i hear a loud banshee bellow.  It sounded as if someone was being murdered.  I paused to look toward the direction of the yelling, and at the same time, all the students came out of their rooms asking themselves what is going on.  I shrug my shoulders because this is typical behavior she has displayed in the past and I walk out through the exit nonchalantly.  As im going to the study lounge, i realize that she's doing this as a cry for attention and more than likely is trying to get security involved.  I pick up my things, get on my bike, and head to my friends home.  I sleep over there, and the next day when i head back to school the school security was already on stand by to bring me in for questioning.  They drag me into the main office and have me fill out a statement of what happened the day prior.  I tell my side and they don't tell me anything about what she said or claims, except that they have all my personal belongings in storage.  I get my stuff and take it to my friends house.A week goes by and nothing happens, everything is normal, im going to classes, gym, etc... I never even bothered to contact her the moment i walked out of her room.  Then, saturday, the 29th of sept, as i'm leaving the school gym, there were 2 squad cars ready to take me in.  They take me to the station in cuffs, and when i arrive they let me read the my arrest report, which was her statement.This is where it gets unbelievable.  She claimed that we got into an argument, and that i left... but as i was leaving, i arbitrarily decided to go back into her room.  She said she slammed the door on me and that i forced my way in, slamming her head with the door (first battery), then throwing her to the ground (2nd battery) and that i shoved my fingers in her mouth (felony, false imprisonment).  I spend 50 days in jail, and i would've been there still if my friend didn't bail me out.  When i get home, i receive emails from school telling me that i'm expelled, lost my scholarship and that if i show up on campus i will be arrested.  I got out Nov 12th, and ever since then, every time i go to court it gets continued and pushed back.  This last time i went, 20th of this month, it got continued again for the 24th of April, a calender call day. Now, i want to know what are my chances of beating this?  I'm taking this to court because they tried giving me a plea bargain already of dropping one battery, the other battery as a misdemeanor, but i still get convicted for a felony, i don't have to serve time, but i have to do a year of probation, and 60 hours of domestic violence classes.  There's no photo evidence of abuse, no witnesses, just her written statement. I DEF do not want a felony.  The school says the only way i can get back in is if the charges get dropped completely, and even if the school stuff doesn't work out, i want to be able to finish school in the military, and you can't go the military with a felony conviction.This sucks because i was suppose to graduate this semester with THREE degrees (chemical engineering, chemistry, and mathematics), and now i'm just stuck sitting around doing nothing waiting for this to get resolved.  What can i do?If this sounds far fetched, this is around the 4th time she's done something similar like this, and I'm lucky on my part because i have text messages between her and I where she says sorry for doing things like this. Ex:  One night over the summer, we were at a party and she got belligerently drunk.  I broke up with her and she went berserk on me, slapped me in front of people, yelled, etc... She took me to the back yard to talk, and i told her it was seriously over.  She slapped me, then grabbed my glassed and chucked them as far as she could into the grass.  When i went to go search for them, she put her hand behind her back, and fell on it, then yelled to try to make it seem like i had twisted her hand or something.  Luckily for me, one of my friends was back there pissing and he witnessed the entire thing, which also prevented all the guys from the party trying to fight me for "hitting" my girl.

Okay, so i've been a member on Pinbackfreaks forum for god knows how long.  I remember when i first picked up the guitar 5 years ago it was such a struggle to learn how to play pinback songs since there were barley any tabs.  Recently tabs, and a FEW guitarpro tabs have been coming out.  Like the music videos, i got sick and tired of waiting for someone to make 'em so i taught myself how to.  I got into tabbing out their stuff on guitar pro a few days ago.  I have about 4 songs now tabbed out, and i just need help on them since they're very crude.  I'm not by any means a musician, so my tabs are just trial and error fucking with tempo and note durations till things sound and sync (robs and zachs parts) up correctly.If yall are willing to help, i can upload what i have so far so yall can feel free to add/correct them.Peace Pinback fuckahs!

1czg40	-13004	1366771935	movies	I know this has been done to death, but i want THEE scariest movie you have ever seen. What i've seen already is inside.	Okay, so i've been on this quest to watch the scariest movie ever.  I've been raised watching horror movies since i was a child so maybe i have been jaded by it.  I'm talking when i was 6 i saw Halloween, friday the 13th, psycho, exorcist, etc... We had a small apt, one tv in a shared bedroom, so my father was a horror freak and would watch whatever he liked and warned me they were scary.  I didn't care, i wanted to be cool like my dad and watch what he watched.  The last time i was genuinely scared by a movie was Blair Witch and that was a mixture of 2 things, i was young, and i went there with belief that it was real.  Ever since then, no movie has scared me to the point of not being able to sleep at night. I've searched reddit probably every month for a year to see what the scariest movies were.  Here's the thing, i'm not looking for most fucked up, or shit that was scary when you were a kid.  I want something that has scared you now as an adult.People will mention, the poughkeepsie tapes, August______, Martyrs, Salo, Serbian Film, Audition, Cannibal Holocaust, Megan Is Missing, etc... I've seen these, but these are more of moves that are challenging to watch. Then you have your classics like, The thing (not scary, i watch this now and think its campy), Evil Dead 1 &amp; 2 (same as above), Event Horizon, IT (i don't even know why this is considered scary), Pet Semetary (this WAS scary when i was a kid), Rec, Quarantine, VHS, Skew, Antichrist, Orphanage, The Others, High Tension, The Tunnel Movie, A Tale Of Two Sisters, The Shining (still don't understand how people say this is scary), Session 9, jacobs ladder, funny games, Please don't mention Jesus Camp.Okay, a movie that i've seen recently that i can say is scary is The Strangers.  I love this movie because there's no cheap scare tactics, its plausible, and the director mastered the art of creepy background images that are very subtle.  Same thing with Insidious, this movie is good up until the end, then again, it became way too campy.I really wanna see something that will make me admit that i'm a pussy and admit that i couldn't go to bed at night!

The movie starts in with a dinner party, after the dinner is done, a couple goes to leave the house, as they grab their coats and head to the door, they stop and can't leave.  The same thing happens to the rest of the couples and they all become stranded in this house and can't leave for no reason.  After a couple of days, the house is surrounded by family and police pleading for them to come out, and arbitrarily one of them finally decides to step out.  ????? any ideas which movie this is?

I use to break dance, and have done kung fu and gymnastics so for me a lot of these poses come natural to me now, and its hard for me to translate how i do them to her, i guess because the language barrier in terminology.  Example, what i call a frog stance is a baksana in yoga, same goes with a lot of other poses, plus, she gets kinda frustrated with my explanations, so maybe there's videos that are easier to understand for her.

One of the things is instant coffee and soda you can get.  The proteins are packs of tuna, oysters, beef jerky, cheese sticks, and just junk food.

The teacher told us to pair up and write a short children's story.  The impending disaster of this situation was exacerbated because my friend happened to be in the class and was as like minded as me.  Here's as much as we could read before the teacher kicked us out:&gt;The birds were chirping, and the bees were buzzing. Inside the bedroom, Mr Lumberjack arose with his morning wood... then a tiny squirrel came upon the windowsill, mouth full, panting ecstatically, to which the Lumberjack greeted, "good morning Mr Squirrel, have you had your nuts this morning?"The teacher immediately cut me off there and sent me to the principals office.

My gf at the time comes stumbling in still drunk from last night and she tells me, "I went out with my friend, got drunk, and fucked her brother."I raised my eye brows in shock, and i approached her furiously and said, "Why the fuck did you...." interrupting, she says "im sorry i cheated!!" and i say "i wasn't finished. I'm asking why the fuck did you put my rock climbing shoes outside???? The sun will make the leather shrink, damnit!" I drive the point further, "now i gotta stretch these things out again, i'll be back in 10 hours, think about what you've done."

That could barely make out what was going on during the fight scenes?  There's some parts that were clear, but for the most part i didn't know what was going on.  It all seemed like a blur of neon colors mixed with the darkness of the kaiju then fast cuts to the pilots drifting crashing about (and i could barely see what was going on sometimes there as well) back to quick cuts of the fights.  I really wanted to love this movie because all i was expecting were good fight scenes, but i couldn't tell what was going till the fight was over and knew who the victor was.  I'm not trying to hate, but as fast as MOS was during the fights, i could clearly see what was going on.  It seems like everyone on here saw everything.  The only fight that was clear what was going on was during the try outs. For me everything else felt like i was watching fight scenes from Batman Begins. I'm not saying i dislike the movie, because i was surprised how much i liked the stuff without the action (charlie day stuff).

1vo9o6	-13004	1390229496	movies	Inside Llewyn Davis. I've seen discussions here, and over at other forums, but no one has yet to discuss why the cat was in the movie. Here are my thoughts.	I've seen people discuss the morale of the movie: such as never giving in and selling out when it comes to your dreams, follow your own path, don't try to change for anything/anyone, etc.  Then I've seen things that were pretty spot on about the ending and why they showed Bob Dylan.  Basically, that even though Llewyn did everything he could for his music, in the end, it was Bob Dylan that got noticed by the (reviewer), he made it, and Llewyn (or Van Ronk) &amp; the rest fell into obscurity.  No one has discussed why the cat was in the movie, or better said, why there were 2 cats in the movie.  Usually Coen Brothers movies are hit and miss for me, and i usually tend not to think about the misses because of their ambiguous endings.  But the cat thing popped out to me.  I think the cat represents Davis.  Not Ulysses, but the cat that was mistaken for Ulysses, and Ulysses represents Bob Dylan.  Therefore, i think that the way Llewyn tries to help and at the same time neglects the cat represents how his own friends/strangers help/neglected Llewyn.  Throughout the film strangers and friends tried to help out llewyn; Jean, Jim, Cody, The Gorfeins, his sister.  At the same time, some of these very same people and others have slammed the door in his face (so to speak); Jean, his sister, the naval guy, and Bud Grossman.  The act of having the "door slammed" in his face is represented by that scene when he goes to the back seat and the cat is waiting there to be picked up, and Llewyn stares at the cat for a while before shutting the door.  The ending of the movie ends with Llewyn limping towards the street to see the guy that beat him up drive away in the cab.  The stray cat's last scene shares the exact same fate.  Llewyn hits the cat, and the last that we see of this cat is it limping away into the woods then Llewyn drives off.  In the end, Bob Dylan gets picked up by the reviewer, and we all know how Bob Dylans career turns out.  On the same token, Ulysses returns back home to the lap of luxury.  Also, Llewyn bringing back the stray cat to the Gorfeins only to be rejected parallels how Llewyn was so close to making it in but being rejected in the music business. Or, just Llewyn Davis as a whole lives a stray cat life; living from place to place, bumming for food and hand outs, sometimes being helped, sometimes being rejected  Any thoughts?

My riff is this, i think its redundant that i fill out the fields on our data base website, then do the same exact thing over again in my sheet 1 excel sheet.

27hu30	-13004	1402083628	ketogains	I've been in keto for the last 7 months and i've dropped from 210 to 160, but i'm the most muscular i've ever been even when i was eating carbs and lifting weights. Can someone explain this?	I know the physiology behind carbing up and eating protein to get bigger.  The glucose helps transport the proteins quickly to your micro fatigued muscle for healing.  But when you're not eating carbs, how does your body become anabolic?  I'll post up progress pics soon so you can see what i went from to what i am now, and i'm probably the most muscular i've ever been.  I lift, run, and climb (rock climbing)  stronger than i ever have.  I understand that i'm burning ketones and fat for fuel, but what exactly is causing the anabolism?

28sp0t	-13004	1403450029	keto	My progress on keto doing it for 8 months. Pics inside.	http://imgur.com/26wP2ksNow, i got like this without doing KTD, or CKD, this is straight keto for 8 months. I rock climb for the most part, 3 times a week, and hit the gym the other days to do cardio. I run 7 miles the days i go to the gym and just really ab work outs for my core (for rock climbing). I don't go hard in the gym in terms of trying to life a lot of weight, but i life weights that are conducive for rock climbing. So if i use a lat pull down machine, i do with locked arms, and leaning back a tad to simulate a front lever. I do a lot of fly's for my chest to simulate compression problems you'd encounter when climbing a boulder outside. For abs, 2x a week i do 6 sets of standing abrollers (for those that don't know what that is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh36x7e8iFg[3]  ) 5 reps each, but my rest in between is to use the oblique machine, 130 lbs. Thats about it. My diet really consists of eating whenever i'm hungry. I don't count calories, nor grams of protein, nada. I eat basically meat all day and fat. After my work outs i drink Carnivor protein and mix it with almond/coconut milk, which is 5g of carbs but its 5 g of fiber. I drink metamucil (sugar free), 3 spoons a day of it to keep me regular.Edit:  For those that wanna see the lower half, its blurry i know, but this is the pic that i took when i got to fit into a size 30 waist (going from a size 36):  http://imgur.com/h5js7m2

2an0hg	-13004	1405310551	movies	What really floored me about Planet of the Apes was the fight scenes between Cesar and Koba. Namely the first one.	Did anyone else get floored by the first fight scene when Koba tells Cesar he doesn't love his children.  Then Cesar proceeds to bash him into the ground?  It was like... more real than real, because thats how people fight in real life out of anger.  Cesar just kept pounding away at Kobas face that i had to look away for a second  and remember it was CGI.  Then Kobas face after the beating, looked so real... the way he lied there gasping for air reminded me so much of Fight Club when jared leto's face got smashed in.  The last fight scene was just brutal.  The camera work was like something out of A Man From Nowhere, or i saw the devil the way the camera did tracking shots following the beatings they gave each other. Such a great movie. 
2drm1i	-13004	1408239474	swoleacceptance	Almost got de-swolerized from the neck down. Praise be to Brodin for sparing my life this time. 18 wheeler came at me like a helicopter from T2.	So as i was leaving the Iron Temple after doing a casual day of squats (20 reps of 1220lbs, not even my PR). And as i was driving vigilantly texting my gains to other brothers in swole and reading the amino acid profile of my protein shake, an 18 wheeler in the orthogonal street decides to make a right turn on red into my lane. I swear, this guy must have been doing tabata squats from the truck pit stop whence he came because that agent of Brodolph Hitler had a heavy ass leg to be pressing the gas pedal so impasse. Either that or he was trying to reenact the chase scene from T2. When he took that right turn he decided to swerve into the furthest left lane, causing the tail of his truck to come left hook around to me like Chris Browns greatest hits. I had already slowed down and maneuvered my car as close to the guard rail as possible before i saw the freight box come sliding towards my passenger side anxious to come squeeze out the remainder glycogen from my depleted muscles (or crush my car). If it was not for my uncanny reflexes, my car would've been an automobile toothpick for a decepticon. And by reflexes I mean repeatedly flexing my pecs and biceps to the point of inflating them like an ejected myofibril air bag to sustain the integrity and shape of the car causing the freight to bounce off and realign itself with the cock pit of the DOMS suffering Brocifer. Broki almost got the best of me. Luckily Brodin had granted me the strength of adrenaline to use whatever swole i had left to protect my body (and car). Wheyman Brothers

2ezjc1	-13004	1409379226	swoleacceptance	Swolested at work elevator AND brorated with Brorogatory comments (WARNING: TRIGGER)	So its no secret i work in a building full of corporate big pigs, mountain walruses, obeasts, bipedal land manatee's, ham planets, and mud bathing beached whales. I was coming back from lunch so it goes without saying that i was doing dead lifts using the back of my car to get rid of all the glycogen stores left in my quads so i could start getting shredded. I casually walk back into my building gently breaking each tile on the floor as i finesse-fully try to catch up to an elevator that i see is being held open by someone out of view. I edge my way in and see that its a not-so-fat receptionist welcoming me with a cheese-brick-eating grin and doesn't know how to contain herself. I lean back against the elevator wall and notice her rehearsing to herself how to segue some sort of question to open up communication with me. "So.... are you training here?"My knee jerk reaction after hearing that question was to analyze my forearms in glee; noticing how the carpi radialis and ulnaris rippled with sinew grace, and how the vascularity wrapped around them like a Francis Bacon staircase. I started breathing heavy in excitement seeing my own body that my abs started protruding through my Ferragamo sweater, causing it to look like the carapace of a turtle because of how discretely shaped each one of my 8 abs were. And i caught myself...."No, this is not the main Iron Temple I train in.""uhhhh... no, i meant if you were in a training class... for new hires...""No, i work here.""Really, which dept?""Wire dept.""Wow, i don't see that....""What does that mean?""You're like.... too fit to be working there... i imagine its old nerds working there and never leave their desk. You seem like you'd be a bouncer somewhere, or security for the president."WHAT!!!! I was swolested and brorated in one sentence. All of a sudden all the sound around me dropped a few octaves bottle necking into a muffled bass of haze..... While she kept talking all i could hear was Charlie Browns teacher, and i started to raise my hands the way Jean Claude Van Damme did in blood sport (http://bringonthepaincave.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/bloodsport-blind.jpg) and stare at my fingers as everything became a fog and all i saw was gray... I was about to lose it.... I had forgotten.... I had to maintain composure and not let my anger make my muscles rip through my clothes again because i had forgotten....Then the elevator door rings and opens! THATS IT! I remembered i left my preworkout shake in the break room! So i bolted through the doors and heard behind me in the trail of smoke i left, "hopefully i'll see you again!"And i said while running and not looking back, "unless you're gonna start going to the gym, i highly doubt that!"

When i select all, say about 20 wires, it'll by default print 6 pages for each when all i really need is the first 2.  So what we have been doing, which is time consuming, is clicking on each one individually, selecting it to print only 2 pages, and so forth.

My question is what technique is he using?  I'd guess he's doing a flamenco/classical fanning strum with his index finger but im confused how i can hear each individual note clearly as opposed to just hearing a chord being strummed.  I can play this song on my bass but i finger pluck the notes using my thumb, index, and middle finger to make them clear while it seems like he's doing the same thing effortlessly strumming.

39su5e	-13004	1434286194	Bass	Picked up bass mid Feb because of Pinback, learned this song and only this song within 2 and half months. Here's my cover of Clemenceau	Ok, to preface, i hate it when people try to brag about something by saying in how little time they learned to do something whether its a sport, instrument, etc... to try to come off as some protege. I had been screwing around with guitar for a few years but i never did anything with it because i was always too drunk, and all i knew was simple modest mouse melodies.  So i never knew any fingering technique, couldn't play chords, or play entire songs. When i sobered up i swore to myself to try to master something and stop half assing shit.  This was a very systematic and tedious approach.  I first gathered the incorrect tabs that were out there.  I siphoned correct information from actual bass players here and there playing a riff to them and asking them if it was correct, and i would constantly correct my own tabs.  Then i tabbed them onto guitarpro.  From there, i just loop trained myself playing the song at 50% and increasing it by 5 everytime i thought i got it.  This was about 5 hours a day, every day, and sometimes even 8 hours a day on weekends.  It wasn't easy.  I would constantly have to refer back to the videos of Zach playing it live because i had no clue about chord fingering position, or his pluck-pull-fanning down strum back to bass alternate finger picking...  The dude truly is amazing at his craft.Oh yeah, i also had to get a 24 fret shortscale bass... when i first started i started with a regular 34 bass and it was terrible because i have small hands, and im a rock climber with a pulled pulley on my left ring finger so it won't curl all the way in (if you can tell from the video)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiqA6JFQUyY

I've played Magic close to a year now, recently I've had issues with one member of my current playgroup and at this point I don't really feel like playing anymore. The guy is compulsive liar, everyone knows he's bullshitting but no one will call him out except me, and worst of all this guy is a terrible sport and flaunts his money and good booster luck. I like everyone else in the group but he's been there longer than I and probably won't react well to confrontation, so I've decided to quietly slip away and find other friends. The problem: The only people who play in my school play very casually and most of the players at my local LGSs (I alternate between two stores) are middle aged adults and I'm 17. How should I go about finding a new playgroup?

1jm5ev	-13011	1375511363	magicTCG	Maze's End 4-0 FNM report	Hey guys! I'm a recently new Magic player, I've playing a little more than a year now. Tonight I had the best FNM yet playing this [Maze's End deck] (http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/mazes-end-21-05-13-14/). My first round was against RBW aggro, my opponent's most significant cards were Boros Charm, Warleader's Helix, and Aurelia. I fogged through most of his attacks late game and controlled the board to win 2-0. My second round was against Grixis Control. My opponent used Dimir Keyrunes as his main source of combat damage, making my Terminus useless. I was under close control and barely shaved by 2-1 due in part to some lucky draws. Jace AoT and Nicol Bolas wrecked up the field on occasion. My third round was against Borakdos aggro which included Tajic, Firefist strikers, Boros Charms and Helixs. This matchup was very similar to round one. My deck seemed to play flawlessly this game, other than the occasional direct damage and early game hits I locked my opponent down and won 2-0. My last round was against Selesnya Aggro, this deck was fast. Experiment ones, Rancor, Strangleroot Geists, and mant other fast spells and creatures. I owed my first game victory to a very lucky Terminus. Both games I was practically struggle to keep up my life while slowly drawing land. The second game my opponent mulliganed to 5 which helped. I won 2-0 at &lt; 5 life both games. Like I said, this was the greatest FNM i've ever played, all my opponents were really nice chill dudes and my deck played out as planned.

I know this topic has been posted into the ground, but I still haven't found any solid information that answers my question:I pre-ordered from Amazon, and got a code from them via email. In the product description it says I get beta access and the 3-day head start. My question is, is this the only code I will need? I already have the beta client downloaded and Anet has said they will use the same client for launch. But, kupoforkuponuts said in this thread http://redd.it/wcusn that the code I got from Amazon will only last 5 days after the head start has finished. So 8 days total. Does anyone have any solid information about this? I tried google and searched this subreddit but didn't find any solid answers.Thanks in advance. And again sorry for the redundancy of this topic.

I stepped out of the room while it was downloading and when I came back my computer had restarted and was at the user log in screen. I then launched the client and got a window that read "Repairing data archive". The client then started to download files again, 218,000 of them. My friend suggested a system recovery to revert my computer to a few days back so I wouldn't have to re-download all of the files again. I did this (reverting it to 4 days ago) but the launcher is still downloading all 218,000 files. Why?

Will we both be able to pick up that item without "stealing" it from the other?Basically, will each player get individual loot and nodes, like in GW2, or fight for nodes/materials like wow?Apologies if this has been asked/answered before.Thanks in advance.

My (completely fair) offer of Dalton and Sproles (PPR league) for Ryan was rejected with a "you can't be serious."Also, this guy tried to send me Randall Cobb for Spiller and Welker, saying "that's the best I can do, bro."When I said trading Spiller, who I took #4, for Ryan (4th round) straight up was a bad move by anybody, I received "haha you just keep thinking that. Picks don't matter." When I tested his theory and offered DeSean Jackson for Adrian Peterson and told him "picks don't matter," I apparently didn't get how fantasy football works.Moral of the story - if the first offer from a guy is laughably low-balling, don't bother trying to talk trades.

isvd4	-13043	1311002834	MensRights	From the Son of a Feminist	From the son of a feministMy name is Edgar van de Giessen. I am 45 years old and I am the son of one of the former leading feminists in Holland in the seventies of the last century. My mother was the first woman to receive the Harriet Freezer Award, given out by your organization Opzij for outstanding feminist activism.I do not write this to seek any personal sympathy. I write this to share my heart, so that maybe one day men and women may live in love and respect, and not just in mutual legal equality.Before I describe the personal consequences of the feminist upbringing I received as a boy between the age of 7 and 17, I want to express my respect for all women and men who rightfully protest against repression and discrimination on the basis of gender, skin color, or ethnic background.Therefore I would like you to imagine how it is for an growing boy in the age of ten to hear every day from his mother that men are the cause of all trouble in the world, that men are guilty of all crime and war and repression in the world, that all men should be castrated after their semen has been deep-frozen to ensure the existence of the next generation, that men should live in different cities than women, so that they could all kill each other and so solve the problem of their own existence.This is the kind of feminist teaching that I received every day, and created in me a deep mistrust in myself, in male authority, and a feeling of never being able to be good or lovable as a human being because of my maleness. This caused in me a reaction of proving my mother that at least I as her son was different than other men. This quickly turned into arrogance against other men that made me lonely and bare of friends for most of my life.It also caused in me a hate toward women and an anger that I could only repress, because expressing it would prove my mother to be right. This repression thus turned me into a "nice" man as a compensation for the repression who then inevitably held a hidden hate and aggression against women with fantasies of rape and violence.As a result of all of these effects of a rabid feminist's effect on her son, I needed 25 years of therapeutic and spiritual search and deep emotional healing to begin to find my own self-value and to start to experience fulfilling relationships with myself, men and women.The war between the sexes is still unsolved. Divorce rates speak their own sad truth. Violence between men and women still fills the newspapers and feminism has not been able to solve this problem. In my personal case, feminism itself, as it is expressed in ways your organization specifically espouses, in large part created the problems and not prevented them. And if feminism causes men to hate women by cursing the darkness and not lighting an effective candle, feminism needs to ask itself if it is aware enough of the human heart and its complexity to be able to solve the problems it describes.When my mother was giving her feministic lectures and tirades to me as a boy, she never felt once, in all those years, how her words and energies were landing in her own son. Personal love transacts through the ability to feel what the other person is feeling while (s)he is feeling it. The emotional wounding that my mother gave me did not come only from her words, but also in her not-feeling how her words impacted me as a little boy. In these ways, my mother had her own emotional wounding that turned her into a proudly man-hating, feministic unfeeling woman whose antipathy against men in ways supported by your organization turned in me as a hate against myself and against women.What I want to say, is that however some aspects of feminism have an important role in creating equal rights for women, feminism does not have a positive contribution to how men and women can live in respect and love for each other. My intensive feminist upbringing created exactly the opposite. An emotionally healthy man will never have any wish to oppress a woman. An emotionally healthy woman will never have any wish to beat the man with his own weapons.The feminism of the seventies and eighties whose legacy you inherit is a reactive movement that used the same oppressive energy as it was trying to fight against, instead of working with, the real issues, and therefore can never be successful in creating an atmosphere where loving and powerful femininity could blossom in a trusting and respectful atmosphere towards male strength. I do feel and understand that women can only respect male strength if that is rooted in openhearted vulnerability, but feminism and the emancipation movement failed to bring forth a generation of such men and in itself does not have the means to do so.In that way, the feministic movement does not and cannot acknowledge the seminal repercussions of the fact that every man is raised in large part by a woman, and that his adult relationship to women consciously and unconsciously is determined in this large part by his relationship to his mother. Why hasn't feminism created a vision on how to raise boys into loving and strong men, upon whom women can trust and love? How can it happen that boys turn into men that repress, hate, despise or do not respect women? I am convinced, that if a boy receives healthy emotional love from his mother, this cannot happen!It that sense, feminism has always lacked a vision of what emotional health is, how emotionally healthy love can be transacted from one human heart to the other, from mother to son, from father to daughter, from man to woman and from woman to man.Without this vision, whose lack can never be addressed within the myopia feminism has about the human heart, regardless of gender, feminism remains a mere reactive movement that thus incorporates the very themes in men it teaches are wrong, and sadly will never allow it to ever achieve its own purpose.Sincerely,Edgar van de Giessen

But honestly, there's not much to say here except that this video, chronicling the Opelika, Ala., police department's efforts to lure suspects wanted for unpaid child support into custody with the promise of free Alabama-Auburn football tickets, goes from mildly humorous to mildly disturbing — and then to very disturbing — with unprecedented speed.&lt;link to video is at URL shown below&gt;OK, the ruse I get: Rare is the opportunity for authorities to have a wanted suspect walk right into their office. I even kind of get the presence of the local news cameras, in a documentary sense — see "COPS" or "To Catch a Predator" or any of those other cheap thrill shows where the cameras are just along for the ride. Voyeurism, I understand.But why on earth did the local news actually agree to participate in the ruse? "A police sting involving routine, nonviolent offenders? Yeah, our reporting team really wants to play an integral role in making that happen." Really? Where did that producer go to journalism school? The next time Channel 3 sticks its microphone in some random citizen's face, forgive him if he spends the entire interview looking over his shoulder for black vans.As quick and dirty entertainment, though ... well, there it is. "Nearly a dozen" people were arrested in this fashion last Friday, according to the Opelika-Auburn News, which doesn't have much else to add to the story, either. What else is there? Alleged deadbeats love the Iron Bowl, too, and they're paying dearly for it."Article w/ video:http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/blog/dr_saturday/post/-8216-Operation-Iron-Snare-8217-lures-wanted?urn=ncaaf-wp4586

Back in the day when I used to smoke out with my buddy, he'd swipe some weed from his moms stash and we'd go smoke up and I always felt great and had a good time. That was years and years ago. These days every time I try to smoke I always get paranoid and anxious and its generally not fun at all. I'm thinking whatever his mom had was a more milder strain than what most people like smoking nowadays. I'm a total noob at this but I've been trying to do some research and it looks like growers today are trying to breed plants with as much THC as possible but with less of the anti-psychotic cannabinoids. So I guess I'm looking for a strain that's more "balanced."

My favorite matches are close games when we win/lose within 50 tickets or less. Lately though it's been one team getting steamrolled by 150 or more. Tanks and IFV's rampaging freely because I'm the only one whos unlocked the SMAW/RPG, constantly getting pushed back into the spawn, no one going for objectives, etc. I'm almost to the point where I may stop playing for a while in the hopes that when I get back most of the new guys will have ranked up enough.Where'd all the redditors go? I added like 15 new reddit buddies but I never see them online. I'm just looking for a few guys that play on a regular basis to get a decent squad going.

The game had less than 10 tickets to go. I killed 1 more guy with my Rex just as the game ended but my final score ended up being 7-4 when it should have been 9-4. Anyone else have this happen to them? Is this a known issue? I've only noticed it this one time since I've been playing.

The position would be offering $16 an hour, and I would love to have this experience. My parents (as sad as this is to say) pay for my schooling (aside from loans) and for my rent and utilities. I had originally planned to graduate in December, but if I take the co-op, I would have to work during the fall semester and graduate during the spring. My parents do not want me to take the co-op because they "sent me to school to get a degree, and not to work for some company before I graduate." They said that I should focus on school and worry about a job after I graduate. How bad off would I be if I didn't take this opportunity?

My assignment is as follows:In C:-create a stopwatch that will count up-when the user enters Ctrl+C the stopwatch will stop-when the user enters Ctrl+C once again the stopwatch will resume-when the user enters Ctrl+\ the process will exitI have created a timer using alarms. I am able to exit the program when Ctrl+\ is entered. I have gotten to the part where I need to implement the stopping of the watch. The following code is what I have so far. When I execute the program, the watch counts up, and when I press Ctrl+C, it notifies me that SIGINT has been caught, but the watch doesn't stop even though SIGALRM has been blocked.

2ertdh	-13058	1409181605	LucidDreaming	Just wanted to share my experience this morning.	Hey guys. I remember sleeping from 12-7:30. I woke up, but went back to sleep. I had a dream in between which I do not remember. I awoke from there and I was half way asleep I suppose. I started remembering pieces of my dream and I began to think, "Am I still dreaming? Maybe I can control it." My body started vibrating heavily and I remembered reading on here about some thing called WILD and about how beginners shouldn't try it because it can lead to seeing and hearing scary things. I could control how deep I was getting into the vibrating state and everything started to seem hazy. I had tried to do things like this before when I used to be interested in 'astral projection'. I started hearing what sounded like multiple girls screaming in agony. I got scared of what I would see next and was afraid to push through any further so I just closed my eyes (I don't know whether I closed my physical eyes or my eyes while I was in this state) and remembered that I shouldn't be alarmed because it isn't real and came back to an awakened state but it was still hard to get up and moving because of sleep paralysis. Also, I'm sick with a cold if that contributes to weird dreams or anything. What happened to me?

2q3lfe	-13058	1419278638	cscareerquestions	Advice needed for seeking a career in web-development	Hello,I'm having a problem and am wondering what I need to do. I recently graduated college with a Bachelor of Computer Science 5 days ago. I have no internship experience, no project experience (aside from my senior project which I only contributed to the documentation as there was not enough work to go around), and I am about to seek employment for a full-time job. My area of interest is web development (mainly front end) so I would like to find a job in that. My ultimate goal is to freelance after a while by building up a nice enough client base to make it a full time job so I can work remotely and travel for a bit while I'm young (only 22). I already know a little bit of HTML/CSS, Python and SQL. I know I would need to learn some Javascript, but is there anything I can do right now to help me land a full-time job in this field with the limited experience or amount of projects I have now?tl;dr: I have no experience or projects, what should I do to land a full-time job as a web developer for a company?
2x57k1	-13058	1424892650	StudentLoans	Is this a good option for me?	I just graduated in December 2014 with federal student loan debt of $30,986. A guy from 1file.org called me and told me that I have two options. I can pay $238 per month for 240 months which comes out to be $57,120. This is option 1. I fall under the student loan forgiveness plan so my second option is: I pay $166.33 for 3 months as an application fee to be enrolled in the program and for the next 300 months, I pay $39 a month and if I make each payment then after 300 months, the rest of my balance is forgiven. The total for this option is $11,700. I asked the guy what the interest rate is and he said that there isn't one because the rest of whatever is left is forgiven after the 300 month period so it's a flat $39 a month. Am I being tricked? Is there something I don't know or is this a good offer for me? I'm leaning towards taking option 2 but I wanted to check with you guys first before confirming the plan with him.

209n46	-13062	1394662304	infertility	Joined Reddit to post...TTC for 15 months	The last 6 months have been some of the most difficult...my husband and I feel alone in what we're going through sometimes. I was hoping that by finding a community of people who are going through the same thing, we might not feel so alone.We have been trying for 15 months, with no results (no pregnancy, no m/c, nada). We have been seeing a fertility specialist for two months. All of our test results have come back normal (including an HSG a week ago)- everything looks "great" which is so frustrating in and of itself! The fertility specialist wants us to start IUI. We want to go on a trip first because we never had a honeymoon, so we are waiting until July to start the IUI. (We are really hoping that it spontaneously happens naturally before then though!)Thanks for reading and commiserating!...Any advice or support is greatly appreciated :)
20luee	-13062	1395029528	infertility	Just need to vent!	My husband's cousin is unemployed and lives off of family members. She has one son who is about 7, and found out she was pregnant again in the fall. The baby daddy is a deadbeat who has two other kids already himself, one of whom is only a year old. If this weren't already enough of a slap in the face to my husband and I who both have degrees and good jobs and have been trying to get pregnant for over a year, we find out tonight that she's going into labor and plans to name the baby the same name that we had already picked out for our future little one! I am still totally using the name, but UGH! Life is so not fair sometimes :(
21pbmn	-13062	1396131842	infertility	Aaand we're back to Cycle Day 1...	I do my best to expect this day, but I get a tiny bit of hope every. Single. Cycle. And then I get depressed (and angry and sad) all over again. It's easily the single worst day of every month :(
251wyn	-13062	1399567069	infertility	Working with children/families	I have mentioned before in comments that I work closely with families of young children with autism. Coworkers get pregnant regularly, which I have managed to deal with so far. Yesterday, I was meeting a family for the first time when one of them announces that she has been preparing to get pregnant again. If I'm not prepared for and expecting it, pregnancy talk has been really emotional for me lately. This came completely out of left field and I felt like someone had punched me in the stomach. I managed to remain professional even though I wanted to run outside and cry. Working with the kids isn't the issue, it's that pregnancy and talk of pregnancy has become an emotional trigger for me.For those of you who also work with children and families, how do you cope? Do you ever get emotional about our struggles while at work? Do you have any advice?Thank you to all the wonderful members of this sub, I don't know if I could get through this journey without you!
2k001u	-13062	1413991508	InfertilityBabies	After 22 long months...finally here!	My husband and I started trying to conceive January 2013.About 10 months ago, we were referred to a fertility clinic. We had been trying for a year, and each month my hope was fading. My husband was diagnosed with mild MFI, but everything else appeared normal.The fertility clinic recommended that we try IUI. We decided to take some time to think, plan, and save up. We had planned to start treatment in August, but I was finishing grad school and tests, so it kept getting pushed back. In the meantime, I'd found research showing the positive effects of certain vitamins on male fertility. We decided to try it, since it was cheap and harmless. After some unexpected expenses (vet bills, vehicle, etc) we pushed treatment back again, to January of next year. I lost any drive to try on our own, feeling like there was no point after all these months. Fortunately, my husband stayed optimistic. On Monday, our 2nd wedding anniversary, my period was several days late and I begrudgingly took a test, expecting a negative as usual.I cried when the 2nd line showed, and managed to keep it a secret until that night when I surprised my husband with the test wrapped up like a gift.I am currently about 5 weeks. I am still completely shocked that we have been given this amazing, unexpected gift. We are now anxiously awaiting our 8 week ultrasound to see the little one's heartbeat.I posted on /r/infertility for a few months while we were going through the struggle of accepting our infertility. I hoped that maybe someday I would have a reason to post here.I know that we have a long path ahead of us, and the next several weeks are the most uncertain, but I am so amazed by our story that I wanted to share it.Thank you so much for reading, and I wish you all happy, healthy pregnancies!
2m6o0n	-13062	1415891032	InfertilityBabies	I got rear-ended yesterday :(	Stupid lady wasn't paying attention at the interstate exit. Her car had to be towed, my trunk and back bumper are just jacked up.Airbags did not deploy, and I didn't have any visible injuries. I asked 911 to send EMS to check me bc of the pregnancy, and my heartrate and blood pressure were fine. I didn't want to go to the hospital bc hubby was working out of town a few hours away and I just couldn't bear going without him.We went to the ER last night hoping to get an ultrasound just to help our anxiety. They again checked my heartrate and blood pressure. The Dr came in and basically told us that he was certain the baby was fine, etc etc. When the nurse came in with discharge papers I specifically asked about an ultrasound. She basically said that there was no point, it wouldn't help anything, and we just needed to wait and see.I'm not bleeding or anything (thank god) and we have the appt with the OBGYN tomorrow, but this morning I'm feeling a little upset at how they just brushed our concerns aside. I kind of wish we had insisted.Are we totally crazy for wanting that?
2mb09m	-13062	1415989334	InfertilityBabies	Baby_KY update :)	Lil baby KY is doing great in there!Measuring 8 wks on the dot, heart flickering away, cutest little blob!!!Also, based on the Ramzi's Method, right now we're still leaning boy...Regardless, I'm so glad little one is ok from everything this week. Ahhhhhh, this is so cool :)
2oigpe	-13062	1417917378	InfertilityBabies	Telling my boss...any advice?	So I have had some guilt about my pregnancy (it's weird, I know) because it happened right around the time I accepted a new job (MFI surprise baby).Well, I gave my previous employer a 30 day notice, and insurance takes 30 days to approve new paperwork, so long story short I've only been working part time for the new company for the last 2 weeks while waiting on insurance. I got approval this week and will quickly be moving up to full time in the next 2 weeks. I'm excited because we definitely need the money now with baby coming.But, this means I probably will need to go ahead and tell my boss soon. I don't know if it's rational or not, but part of me worries that they'll find a reason not to keep me on once they find out. I know this is technically illegal, but I'm sure if they really wanted to they could find a way.So I feel guilty because I'm the newest employee and almost 12 weeks pregnant. And then I feel bad because I AM grateful for this baby, and I want to be excited without being worried. I could really use advice/support/reminders that I'm not crazy!EDIT: I forgot to mention that the reason I think I'll have to tell soon is that I have our 12 week appt next Friday during business hours...and unfortunately ALL of my appts will affect my schedule due to my Dr's office hours :(
2rcswf	-13062	1420421973	InfertilityBabies	Feeling worse in 2nd trimester?	Wondering if anyone else has been in this boat...I had a bit of nausea in the first trimester, but fairly predictable (if I smelled anything in the morning before eating, I would throw up bile). I also had some manageable constipation.I'm at 15+3 now. About a week ago, I got a brutal headache and tried to tough it out. I ended up throwing up in the middle of the night, my head still hurt and I was so miserable, I took acetaminophen and managed to sleep some. The next day, my head still had dull pain, but my neck was super tender. TMI: I've also been pooping 1-2x a day for the last week, and they've been coming on urgently. And I've been eating smaller meals due in part to anxiety over getting sick again and in part due to heartburn/discomfort.My bump has "popped" during this time, which I think might be affecting the nausea/heartburn side of things. I feel like I do have slightly more energy, but all these other things are making me miserable. In some ways I think I might be more miserable than before. Everyone seems to say that you feel best in the 2nd trimester. If this is my high point, I don't know how I'm going to make it until June :(Anyone been here? Am I doomed? Is there a chance it will get better soon??Thanks to this awesome group, I can't imagine going thru this without you all :)

2vf3hv	-13062	1423578489	InfertilityBabies	Good morning! How's your Tuesday?	My mom left this morning...I'm going to miss having her around, but on the flip side it will be nice to have quiet evenings with hubby again! Also, t-minus 2 days to my anatomy scan! The OB office said they go over Quad Screen results at the appt...that's probably cool right? I keep reminding myself that if anything looked off they would probably call and want to get me in sooner.So those are my baby things for today!  What are yours?
2vgws7	-13062	1423608416	InfertilityBabies	Family at the hospital?	Sorry y'all, I know I did the daily but I didn't think about this until now...So a couple weeks ago my husband and I had our first big baby disagreement. It started with me telling him that I wanted us to have the first day after baby is born to ourselves. I really thought we would easily agree on that. However, he got defensive and upset and said that his parents and sister were going to be in the waiting room because that's what he and his parents did when his sister had her baby.Y'all,  I do not want to feel pressured by or have to worry about anyone but me and baby while I'm in labor. I don't want to feel bad for not getting him out quicker, or feel like I have to let them come see him right away. Fortunately,  we agreed that we don't want anyone else in the delivery room. BUT, my MIL and SIL are pushy, and I can guarantee that if they're at that hospital, they'll try to get in that room.Husband was clearly upset about me not wanting people there, so I dropped it at the time but it's been bothering me since. I know he loves his family, but I don't want to have to do things just like his sister did. They mean well, and they want to be supportive so it's not about that, it's just about wanting a little time with my baby before the onslaught of visitors.So, what was your all's deal in terms of visitors? I suggested that if he was worried about hurt feelings we could "forget" to tell them I was in labor, but that was a no-go. How can we compromise??
2vnqqd	-13062	1423755292	InfertilityBabies	I couldn't wait, it's Thursday!	I just couldn't wait any longer to share...my 20 week ultrasound was today! (At 21 weeks exactly). So my ultrasound was only 15 minutes...normal? She measured femur length, head circumference, looked at heart, got bpm, looked at limbs/fingers/toes, pointed out facial features, saw spine, gave a weight estimate. He's measuring about a week ahead, which is reassuring. No apparent issues, she said at the beginning that she would tell us if she saw any.My blood pressure was also a little high, 140/80 :(. It's been fine up to now, so hopefully just a fluke. The doctor was really brief, and somehow they didn't have my quad screen results in my file...they're going to call me with them later today. They also didn't measure my cervix length, which I thought about after. It had gone from 4 cm to 3.7 cm in about 8 weeks, so not sure if that's ok.But I should just be excited right?? I mean, baby looks healthy,  and if they're not worried I shouldn't be? I just can't help but think we need to check ALL the things...
2xgsk6	-13062	1425137106	InfertilityBabies	Hello Saturday!	We're painting the nursery today with help from my in-laws! I can't believe how fast time is flying.What are you all up to today?
2ymt7s	-13062	1426039901	InfertilityBabies	Rib pain...normal?	Hey gang...So, currently 24w5d with a singleton boy. I have an anterior placenta, but have been feeling pretty consistent movement since 20 weeks. In the last two weeks or so kicks have been stronger and consistently several times a day.Anyways, in the last couple of days baby has been able to kick near my ribs. I can feel when he kicks there but it hasn't hurt. But suddenly tonight my ribs are REALLY sore. They feel more sore towards my back, not in the spot where I feel his kicks.Is this normal? I haven't had any BH that I know of, could it be related to that? Baby's movement today has been normal. I'm mostly worried about it being a symptom of some complication. ETA: Thank you, lovely people, for reminding me that aches and pains are probably normal :). My emotions and moods are all over the map lately so I'm chalking it up to hormones!
2ysfm4	-13062	1426164944	InfertilityBabies	Is it seriously THURSDAY already?	My calendar says yes...Also, my scale says I've gained 5 lbs in the past week, and my wedding ring is snug. I have a regular appt with my OB tomorrow morning, but since my mom had pre-e with me, I'm going to be making a call to them shortly. As soon as my boss decides to start the meeting that was supposed to happen 30 minutes ago...

30eqsw	-13062	1427399492	InfertilityBabies	A little shocked at what my husband said about my time at home...	Update: so, we talked last night and I straight up asked him if he thought that being at home would be easy. I am happy to report that he immediately and adamantly said no, and that he remembered when his niece was little (his sister still lived at home). So, while I feel better that we at least seem to be on the same page, I will DEFINITELY be taking the overwhelming advice to make sure that he has alone time with baby. He will be taking 1-2 weeks of paternity leave, and I know he'll be involved then. We've also talked about him staying with baby on weekends while I do errands, so I think that will be great experience as well. Thanks for all the input!So, this morning I was messaging my husband about my weight gain (I've gained almost 25 lbs at 27 weeks) and how I think 35 is a realistic goal to stay within by the end. I then mentioned that I'd like to lose a few extra pounds from my pre-pregnancy weight (although it was in the normal BMI range, I felt better when I was about 10 pounds lighter). My husband was very sweet and supportive, and said he was sure I could do it. Then he said that I could use our elliptical while the baby slept during my mat leave while he was back at work. I said that I would, but that sleep would also be important.He said, and I quote, "Well I hope you won't be sleeping the whole day while I'm at work and you're home with him." Which caught me TOTALLY off guard. I responded that I obviously wouldn't be, since I'd be up changing his diaper, feeding him, holding him, etc. but that I would need sleep too. I also pointed out that I probably won't sleep as much at night as he will since he'll be working, so I'll need to make up for it some during the day. He got a little defensive after that, and said that he hadn't meant it like I wouldn't be doing anything.I understand that we weren't talking face to face,  so we probably miscommunicated a bit, but it does make me a little concerned. Will he likely realize how much work a baby is once we're in the thick of it? Is there anything I can do to help him realize that I won't just be lounging around all day? I could see this being an area of tension later and just want to try to clear it up now.Thanks gang!

I love my carbs and sugars, so this could be rough.Thanks!

Tell me what you're up to that's way more fun than this!ETA: My fasting level was 91. Woo! Good start.E2: The first 30 minutes was rough, y'all. I highly recommend asking if you can walk between blood draws, and if you can sip water. If they let you, do both! I think it's made a big difference in how I feel.
334k6z	-13062	1429452376	InfertilityBabies	A Sunday morning post-shower hangover	Hello, gang! We had an AMAZING shower yesterday, with tons of friends and family! It was honestly overwhelming how much stuff we got, but we feel so so loved. There were lots of belly rubs, but most of them I was at least warned about first. Most people said I'm "all belly," which was nice to hear too. We were exhausted by the end of it, and are going to recuperate today.How are you all?
33iws4	-13062	1429739768	InfertilityBabies	Let's get to know each other!	Since we've had such a burst of new members lately, I thought it was about time that we got acquainted!I'm on mobile, so sorry for formatting.- Living in the southern US (SC)- just turned 25!- married 2.5 years (we've been together 5.5- met on Match :))- 2 years of infertility (MFI) before a miracle natural success!- Now 31 weeks with a little boy due in June :)- we have 2 cats and 1 dog who have been our babies through it all- I love to cook, but don't get nearly enough time toNow, tell us about you!
341ak9	-13062	1430146559	InfertilityBabies	A case of the Mondays	Good morning, gang! How is everyone doing?I have slept horribly the last two nights. Sat night I had insomnia which was made worse by a 3 am baby party. Last night, my head suddenly got congested and then I got a massive headache. Is this the start of the dreaded 3rd trimester sleeplessness I've heard about?? It seems like time is suddenly at a standstill :(
34q0a1	-13062	1430665556	InfertilityBabies	Sunny Sunday	Well, it's sunny here at least.The baby things have been acquired. The next big hurdle is washing them...I have this fear about "jinxing" anything by washing/de-tagging too early. IF brain I guess???What are you lovely people up to?
35tx9u	-13062	1431525871	InfertilityBabies	Why Me Wednesday	I woke up with what appear to be hives on my stomach. At the doctors office now, expecting to be diagnosed with PUPPPs. Between being overloaded at work, the return of constant head congestion, and now this, I'm not having a great week :(I never thought I'd get GD. Let alone that and PUPPPs both. I hope you all manage to avoid these things, I'm having a rough time :(
36f27o	-13062	1431986203	InfertilityBabies	anyone else get really cranky near the end?	So I'm 34w4d. I've got diet-controlled gestational diabetes (so I can't eat what I want), PUPPPs (my belly itches all the time), I'm having regular contractions that arent doing anything to my cervix, and I'm 99% sure that my kid who was head down at week 20 has gone transverse.So, in short, I'm really cranky at the moment. I imagined that at this point I'd be happily eating everything I ever wanted,  sporting a lovely stretch-mark-free belly, with a head down baby ready to go.Can y'all remind me that it gets better?? I need some perspective right now...
37yges	-13062	1433079456	InfertilityBabies	Sweet Sunday	Could be sweet for a lot of reasons, right?Mine's pretty sweet right now bc I'm laying in bed watching my belly dance.Later, there will be brownies.
38sikd	-13062	1433595536	InfertilityBabies	Saturday!	It means different things for us all! For some it may be date night, baby snuggle time, or just relax time. For me, it's nesting time! I've had a burst of energy this week, and it's become especially strong after learning yesterday that we'll have a newborn in less than 3 weeks!So, tell me about your stuff while I organize all the things and my husband fusses at me for doing too much!
39zi3x	-13062	1434417875	InfertilityBabies	PSA: Call your doctor if you have a concern	So, I know I have been regaling you all with comments in the Dailies about my swelling. After today, and because I am one of the further along ladies at this point and I feel I should help guide others, I am making a separate post.The background: I am 25, average height, slim-average build, surprise pregnancy after MFI. I don't know if any of that's relevant, but hey why not. My pregnancy has been fairly typical, besides a gestational diabetes diagnosis received around 30 weeks. The GD has been diet-controlled and actually improving since 35 weeks. I also had PUPPPs for about 2 weeks that mysteriously went away.  I've gained an average amount of weight (~ 35 lbs).Since week 34ish, I have noticed swelling in my legs. No big deal, would go away when they were elevated. In week 35, my thighs suddenly swelled up while my lower legs did not. I went to see my OB and my blood pressure was slightly elevated but not yet worrisome; they said the swelling was just something that happened and basically to suck it up. I noticed the thigh swelling on and off for a couple of weeks, and then it became pretty constant at 37 weeks. My Dr still wasn't concerned, he said it happens, and I was still pushing through ok. I had what felt like muscle knots, but assumed they were from carrying extra weight.Then, around 38 weeks, my thighs were hurting all the time and the right one was so bad I could hardly bend it at all. I'm a proud lady and wasn't going to go in to have them tell me to suck it up again. I mentioned it at my regular appt, my Dr felt my legs, and said it just felt like fluid spots- nothing unusual.Two days after that appointment, I got out of the shower and noticed that the part of my thigh that hurt the most was reddish-purple. It was a Saturday, so I called the after-hours line and heard back from the on-call doctor. She told me to take Tylenol, put my legs over the back of the couch, walk, and use ice/heat. I'd already been trying to move more, and had been using heat for the last week, but I tried anyway. I didn't notice any change.So, today (Monday) I called during normal hours and they had me come in. Honestly, I did it because my husband and mom insisted. I was sure they were going to tell me I was crazy. The nurse (I usually see the same one bc they are paired with one doctor) was kind of short with me and said that this was probably just something that wouldn't go away until I delivered. I felt a little dumb for apparently wasting time, but I was already there.I have to give major props to my doctor here- he came in and instead of assuming I was just whining, he started measuring my legs. Indeed, the right leg was about 4 cm wider than the left. It was enough of a difference that he sent me to imaging at a local hospital.The imaging showed that there was reduced blood flow in my right leg- but they couldn't identify why. There was no identifiable clot, but blood was not flowing normally through the major vein. Instead, it was redirecting to smaller ones.The best they could tell was that the vein was being compressed so much by the weight of the baby that it was slowing blood flow. And that red spot I noticed? An infected lymph node caused by the poor blood flow.So, I am on a hardcore dose of (safe) antibiotics, and wrapping bandages around my legs for compression. My doctor called me twice  (once after regular business hours) to check in and order the antibiotics.  I understand why he shrugged it off before, I don't think it had turned into the issue it is until the last week. I'm just thankful that he acted when I needed it!Moral of the story: if something is really uncomfortable, or a sudden change, or worries you for any reason, CALL!
3agm6q	-13062	1434758873	InfertilityBabies	Baby KY surprise entrance!	I'll post a full story with more details when things settle in, but I wanted to tell you all that my baby boy was born via c-section this afternoon! I went into labor this morning, but they didn't want to risk his size.He is 21.5 inches long, 9lbs2oz, with a head of hair and looks so much like daddy.He is currently in the NICU for rapid breathing, but they expect him to be discharged in a few days. It's hard not having him with me, but I did get 10 glorious minutes of skin to skin. He is so calm, he dozed off! I get to see him again in about an hour so I'm stoked.I'm doing ok, a little extra bleeding but it's under control. It's still so surreal that I'm a mommy to this guy!Best wishes to all!

281soj	-13063	1402666250	italy	Che ne pensa /r/italy di MGS?	Circa un anno fa ho cercato di farmi piacere a forza il primo capitolo di MGS, giocandomelo su un emulatore per Android. Alla Boss Fight contro il carro di Raven, dopo tante di quelle bestemmie, lo lasciai per colpa dei controlli ingestibili su un touch. Qualche mese fa però, convinto di nuovo a riprovare per l'ennesima volta quel maledetto MGS, l'ho riprovato su PC con un controller PS3. Amore a prima vista. L'ho finito in circa di due giorni, ogni scena e ogni combattimento mi sono rimasti impressi nella testa. Il secondo mi ha fatto storcere un po il naso, per via del protagonista, ma quelle boss fight e tutte quelle scene fatte così bene bastavano per perdonare Kojima. Il 3 è stata l'apoteosi, tutto così perfetto e emozionante, una perla incredibile che mi sono pentito di non essere riuscito a giocare circa 2 anni prima. Pochi giorni fa ho finito anche il quarto, che sinceramente mi è piaciuto leggermente di meno rispetto agli altri, probabilmente per via del gameplay più alla TPS che stealth classico, ma comunque tutta la sequenza finale è bastata per metterlo nella lista dei capolavori. Sono curioso di sentire la vostra su questa saga che reputo veramente meravigliosa e così ben costruita.

To be clear, I'll make a list (and an [album](http://imgur.com/a/NPrxA)) * Two Diamong Dogs Soldiers are fightning on Mother Base  * The soldier with long sleeves and gloves pulls out a knife and probably try to kill the other soldier with the short sleeves  * Big Boss forces the soldier with short sleeves and without gloves, and not the one with the knife, to stab Big Boss himself. (???)  * Behind Big Boss, just when he gets stabbed, it can be seen a something that seems like a body, probably of the other soldier.     Really want to know what you think about this, I'm really confused...

Anyway, I want to make a little analysis here about these requirements, comparing them with a PS4:  -The processor is strange, I really doubt it will be able to use at 100% a haswell i7 so I have no idea what it could be the recommended CPU;  -The 650 is not as as powerful as a 7790, the card that has about the same power of the PS4 GPU, but it kinda sounds like an exageration. I mean, it'll need 980 as reccomended or what?  I hope notThe only thing that came in my mind is that for minimum requirements they mean what you need to play it at 60 FPS at decent details, if it's not like that I'm really scared of what it woulda need to play it at max settings in 60 FPS and 1080p
2mslkr	-13063	1416422189	pcmasterrace	A friend ascended today... With a shitty rig	Hello brothers, a friend of mine just wanted to ascend from a year, and now he just got all the money to buy a good rig... But he did the worst thing he could have ever done...  But first, a little backstory:   My friend's father didn't want to listen to anyone than a technician, a friend of him, because of the amount of money they would have spend. I tried to warn my friend because of the shitty specs lists this technician was constantly creating, but in the end he just bought all from him... And you know what? It's a piece of crap.  -CPU: Intel I7 4820K (I couldn't believe he actually bought this)  -GPU: Random GTX 770 (After a while he succeed to change this to a 970, as I was trying to save him)  -RAM: A single 8 GB Corsair Vengeance...  -HDD: A 2 TBB Seagate Barracuda (not bad, but with 1200 Euros he could have get a HDD and either a SSD if he would have not bought that i7)  -Case: An Inwin... I don't know the model, but it looked not as bad as it sounds.  Now, I know it isn't horrible for gaming, but just looking at that CPU and Ram... What a waste of money. And I don't know either why I wrote all this.  Ok sorry bye

After some tries, I noticed that the ribbon cable wasn't attached to the other end (behind the CPU\GPU block), but now It has costantly the Blue led (Disc inserted), even if it's empty, obviously, and it still does nothing, a part from the blue ray sensor moving when I turn it on or when I try to stuck in it a disc (it's like it's trying to get that but it can't..)Now I have two theories:  1) I fucked up the ribbon cable (It's for the sensor, right?)  2) I broke the drive (dunno how) Sorry for my bad english, but I'm not a native speaker and I don't know a lot of those specifics terms.    Thanks!

Hey, after 30 hours of gameplay I finished the entire story, and I must say that the Delta Episode was really really good.  When I finished X I tought that something was missing, and I was right. The DE explained everything, and I find this whole multi-verse thing really cool for the Pokémon Universe.  And the Zinnia theme... I don't know why, but in my head I was costantly thinking about some song from Pokémon Mistery Dungeon (not a bad thing, those themes are probably some of the best I ever heard).  Dunno why I'm writing this, probably I want to know what you guys are thinking overall about ORAS

Edit:Let's define win as occupying every capital and destroying the enemy leadership. Given that this is how I see it playing out:The humans would be the first to fall since they are in the weakest position. They would be attacked in Kessek Hills initially by the Sylvari.The Asura, assuming they can get organized, would take Brisbane Wildlands and northern Caledon Forest giving them a position to assault Queensdale and defeat the humans.The Slyvari would put up a lot of resistance around the grove and southern Caledon Forest waging jungle warfare/insurgence.For the East the Charr are powerful but they have one major hurdle, the Norn and the Shiver Peak mountains. While the Charr would easily win in open warfare, defeating the Norn in a terrain that eliminated their advantage would be an issue. I think the Charr and Norn would be locked in battle for a long time.The same goes for then the Asura eventually reach the Shiverpeaks.

Negatives?  Thanks in advance for the help!

I've searched around and I'm aware that it's not the greatest bike, but then I am a noob so it's a good starting point for me as of now.  I'm happy with it so far.  I'm looking for some advice from the community for simple upgrades or just simple things I could do to my new toy that might help prolong its life and keep it in good working order.  Things that might lighten the bike or small things that will help when riding trails.  I haven't taken it off the pavement yet because I ordered a helmet and it isn't here yet.  I don't really have the cash to throw into it for a new front suspension or anything crazy like that but simple low dollar things I could buy over the next few months.Any help would be appreciated!

Turns out it looks like I waited a bit too long.  The passenger side came off easily and I sanded it down and wetsanded the paint underneath which was stained by rust.  Looks great.The drivers side however, not so much.  I think what has happened is the top of the actual mirror has rusted to the metal coupling thing that goes in the middle.  Basically when I turn the mirror, the middle coupling turns along with it.  I've tried WD40/prying/twisting with vice grips/banging with a hammer (as you see by the bottom of the mirror...everything I know. If anyone has any ideas on how to get this taken care of I'd really appreciate it. 
x43yu	-13074	1343189061	Jeep	Old TJ vs. Newer JK delimma	I need some help.  I know this is solely a personal preference type of post so I'll get plenty of different answers, which is kind of what I'm looking for.I'm at a crossroads with my 99 Sahara.  I've had her since 03 and its pushing 96k miles.  I've never been one to keep a vehicle long after reaching that point in mileage nor have I ever been handy with fixing things myself (small stuff I can do myself but don't trust myself to much else).  My old man always told me to try to keep a vehicle with a warranty in case something goes bad (he's not a wrench turner either due to a medical condition).  I'm not really ready to have to pay someone an extravagant amount in case something goes haywire.  She's showing signs of a small amount of rust on the bumpers but I assume that's somewhat normal for the year of the vehicle.  That's really about it minus a few cosmetic paint issues which aren't too big of a deal. However, I haven't had a payment in about 3 years, so that's a plus.  The value on it has ranges anywhere from 5k to 8k depending on the service giving the price (kbb/nada etc).  This is my daily driver and my daily commute is about 5 miles round trip.  Over the last few weeks I've found myself here on reddit and cars.com and other sites salivating over the new JK.  After riding with a few buddies of mine on the beach in the Outer Banks NC I realized how much nicer the insides and how much smoother they ride.  Looking around online I also realize JK's, even the 07's are still pretty pricey.  No way would I be able to afford anything brand new.  I originally was looking to get a Rubicon in a JK style but I'm pretty sure they're out of my price range even an 07.  A 4 door would be a nice option at this stage in my life but not completely necessary so there's that.  I don't do alot of off-roading but would like something that could handle it if need be.  I never lifted the TJ but I got the usual 31" tires which is probably what I'd do if I got a JK (bigger tires/black wheels).  Basically I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar issue with owning a TJ that's getting "up there" in miles and switched to a JK.  Were you blown away by anything in the JK?  Is the engine better?  Is there a difference in any of the new JK engines?  Should I wait for the new models to come out before purchasing for a slight price drop?  Would you keep the TJ and maybe do some small mods to it instead of getting something new or sell it while the value is somewhat decent?I really love my TJ and we've been thru alot together.  Getting rid of her would be like giving away my dog. As I said, I'm just looking for opinions and I understand that in the end it will be my preference.  This community has always been helpful to me and I know I'll get some intelligent discussion that might sway me in the right direction.

I got seats that should be pretty close to the Lions bench.  I have a full sized Lions helmet and I'm wondering if you guys think i would look like a tool carrying it in there or wearing it?  I would really like to get an autograph or two.  Is it allowed to do that?  I've only been to one NFL game in my life and that was Redskins v Eagles so I'm not sure.  Cool or uncool?

136yqs	-13074	1352918256	Android	Black Friday Tablet deals	I am planning to get my girlfriend an android tablet in the 200-300 price range for Christmas.  She is an iphone user but i can't see myself dropping that much cash on an ipad. I've looked thru a few ads that have been released and im seeing the Galaxy tab 2 7" for $180 and the Galaxy 10.1 for $280.  I mentioned it to her that i was thinking of getting it and she said she was worried about not knowing how to use it. I explained it was really easy but i would rather not have a dissapointed on Xmas morning while not blowing 400bux.Questions. Are the two tablets i mentioned worth the price while still being user friendly for a noob (I can help her, i own a galaxy s2 e4gt)?Are there any other tabs that might be a better deal for a similar price?She will be using it mostly for playing games, social media and she is a nursing student so i'd love to sell her on some apps that might get her interested in using the tablet.Feel free to ask any questions! Thanks in advance!
13cyet	-13074	1353176014	CRH	My second time CRH	I caught the silverbug about 2 months ago and I'm still a noob at the whole CRH and my stack is still pretty weak.  I tried CRHing one time before with no luck at the same credit union but they only had 3 rolls.This morning I got up and went to my local credit union.  I asked did they have any half rolls and bought all 5 that they had and got out another $50 to go to a local coin shop to look around (ended up buying a canadian maple).  Ended up with 16 40%ers out of $50 worth. [Link](http://imgur.com/HMtPk)Even though I didn't find any 90%, I'll consider today as a win!  I'm pretty pumped and figured I'd share with you folks!

I know my stack is weak compared to many here but I thought I would share my little bit of pride.[Mini Stack](http://imgur.com/Hz6a2)I bought my first junk coins on Ebay on September 25th, getting ripped off by about $5 because I had no idea what I was doing.  Since then I've been getting my junk right around spot and paying a little bit of a premium for silver I really want (ASE, Maple). Even asked my girlfriend for a Kookaburra for Christmas, just because I think they're beautiful.  I have several apps on my phone that I can check out silver prices on the fly in case I'm somewhere and there's a deal to be had.I had my girlfriends dad explain coin roll hunting to me about a year ago.  I was interested but not $500 every payday interested, like he is.  I tried a few times but this past weekend I hit the jackpot scoring 16 40%ers out of $50 in halves.  Made my week!  There's very few feelings as good as pulling piece after piece of silver out of a roll.Of course I went back to the same Credit Union Monday afternoon and got straight up skunked but I feel I had that coming.Anyways, I appreciate all the articles, advice and especially Silver Pron here at silverbugs!  It's a great community.  It has become a very fun and addictive hobby.

I popped over to /r/PMSFORSALE and someone was selling a gold Ron Paul round and I was wondering if anyone knew where I could grab a similar coin in Silver (without the super high ebay premium). Do they still make them?  I googled them but could only locate them on ebay and they're selling for more than I want to pay right now.

One of the older ladies and I had been talking about coins and silver recently.  I'm new to it and she's old school.  I'm more into the silver and she's more into the cool factor of old coins.  Mutual respect.  She hands me the 1964 90%er and I check it out and tell her how cool it is and go to hand it back to her and she say's I can keep it.  Then she pulls out the Morgan and shows me that.  Me, being new to the game I do not own a Morgan and have never felt one.  I inspect it thoroughly and then she says I can keep that one as well!  [photo](http://imgur.com/a/JnCIJ)I offered to buy them from her and would have even given her a decent amount but she just responded  "What? You gonna give me a dollar fifty?  Just buy me a coffee next time you see me."  After trying to explain that it's worth alot more and I was willing to pay her, she still wasn't trying to hear it.  I thanked her and left work 20 min later with a smile on my face.TL;DR Shitty days at work are instantly cured by free silver.

Long story short, when I signed up for Direct I was told I would not get local stations in my area (NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX) but I would get the stations, just from other areas.  I assumed New York, which I'm fine with.Got my brand new Genie installed yesterday and I was pretty pleased with the service.  Up until last night I wanted to check out the Final Four game on CBS.  It gives me an error saying I'm not subscribed.After multiple calls to Direct explaining the problem, nobody could help me and I don't really think they understood.  They kept saying "Local channels are not available in your area sir."  I explained that I didn't care if they were local or from another state...I was told that I would have the basic network stations.  The best one guy could do was tell me that I had FoxNews and MSNBC... WTF?  I can't believe that nobodys ever asked this question before.Basically, I'm trying to figure out what I need to do or buy to get those channels and needless to say I'm not really happy about being lied to from the start but now I'm screwed since I signed a 2 year deal.I've searched the net and figured I'd probably have to buy a tuner or a antenna and figure out how to install it on my box?  Any help or a link explaining what to do would be much appreciated!  I'll keep looking around online and if I find an answer I'll delete this post.
1f1ye4	-13074	1369524118	ar15	First time AR builder with some noob questions.	This is my first time building an AR15.  I've done alot of research online but I just want to make sure I'm doing this right and I've learned alot from this subreddit.  I've ordered most of my stuff from Palmetto State.So far I've ordered a blem lower which is scheduled to get here Tuesday, a [PSA CTR Lower build kit](http://palmettostatearmory.com/index.php/ctr-lower-build-kit.html) which arrived yesterday and today I ordered the [PSA M4 Premium Upper 16'' CMV CL Stripped Upper](http://palmettostatearmory.com/index.php/ar-15-05/complete-uppers/psa-m4-premium-upper-16-cmv-cl-stripped-upper-cosmetic-blem-ready-for-duty.html).  It has a few good reviews.  I also picked up some P-mags and a small amount of ammo along the way.So obviously, yes I am on a budget and I'll just be using the gun for just target shooting mostly and to add to my little collection (since I don't own a rifle).  So first off, how did I do (right now I'm sitting at $659 spent for all the parts minus pmags and ammo)?  I know this isn't going to be a crazy awesome AR that is worth 1000's but I think it'll be good enough for me.  Also, what else do I need besides the BCG (which I'll spend a bit more for since I know it's important to have a good one), charging handle and some rear sights?  I'll have a friend who is familiar with ARs to help me assemble everything.Thanks in advance.

Salary, experience, age, strength, versatility all play a part.  I'm guessing the only one the coaching staff cares about is experience.

1rf48n	-13074	1385391638	detroitlions	Fans at Ford Field	Full disclosure, I've never been to Ford Field to watch a Lions game so I can only speak to what I've seen on TV.  I was just wondering why is it that when I never see the crowd get crazy like at other stadiums.  I was flipping back and forth between the Rams/Bears game and ours and the difference was night and day.  You had a team that was leading the division in the Lions and the stadium was not in any way intimidating.  Then you had a team sitting at 4-6 and the crowd was freaking insanely loud.  Why is that?  Why can't the crowd at Ford Field make it an intimidating place to play?  Even just looking in the stands at FF, you don't really see anyone standing up being loud and yelling...there's a few folks that do that but the majority of people are just sitting in their seats with their arms crossed. I've seen one game that made me realize what we could have and that was the Monday night game from two years ago against the Bears.  The Bears line was a false-start fest and couldn't hear Cutler.  Why can't we have that intimidation factor every week?  What happens if we luck out and get a home playoff game?  What good is that if the majority of our fans don't make noise?  Am I the only one that notices this?  Am I off base?

I haven't amassed an enormous stack but I've got some decent items.I'm now at a point where I think I may want to sell some or most of my silver to pay off some of our debt that me and the wife have accumulated while she was in school and our wedding that just happened in May.I've snooped around /r/pmsforsale for while but I'm still not sure exactly what to ask as far as premiums on certain coins.  I don't want to go in and ask too much but I obviously want to get as much as possible.  Is that subreddit the best place to sell?  Should I try to sell locally or thru CL?It's not an easy decision to do this since I like many of you love my silver and like to hold it physically.  I have certain pieces that were given to me that mean more to me and certain pieces that I've bought that I just love that I probably won't be able to let go of.  However, I feel like the time is right to pay off some debt.  I'm guessing there are folks here who have been in my shoes and maybe they can shed some light.

Looks like Best Buy is offering 24 months no interest with purchases $799 and up and I'll likely take advantage of that.  I currently have a Panasonic 42" 1080p plasma that I bought probably 6 years ago.  Still looks decent but I'm hoping to get something a bit bigger.  I'm a huge plasma fan but as everyone knows, they're getting harder and harder to find.  Things I will use the tv for:  I watch a ton of football and movies.  I have a ps4 and use it often for FPS games.I don't see a major need for a smart TV unless there is something that I can't get on my ps4.  Sound quality is not really an issue since I have a sound bar setup.I've narrowed it down to these 3.[Panasonic 55" LED 240Hz](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/panasonic-55-class-54-5-8-diag--led-1080p-smart-hdtv-black/3924175.p?id=1219094699379&amp;skuId=3924175)  This one really caught my eye at the store, although I'm worried about the "Only at Best Buy" availability of this.

This TV seems like a good deal at the price range.[Samsung 60" Plasma](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-60-class-59-9-10-diag--plasma-1080p-hdtv-black/8182045.p?id=1218864995544&amp;skuId=8182045)  It's a plasma, which is what I'm coming from, what I know and love, but might be a bit too big for my apartment.  It has no smart features but is $100 less than the 240hz Panasonic.Thoughts?  Are there other TV's in this price range at BB that I am totally missing out on? I can answer any questions that I might have left out.  Any help is appreciated!Also, is the geek squad protection not worth it or should I consider spending the extra $100ish just to be sure.

After giving up hope on a hybrid holster for light bearing gun I ran across [this from concealment solutions.](http://www.concealmentsolutions.com/blmacewtl.html)  Anyone have experience with this holster or have any other suggestions to make the transition to full size easier?

31mj49	-13074	1428326974	Gunsforsale	[WTS] SOE EDC Belt Size 36 Black/Black w/Cobra Buckle 1.5" [VA]	I just received this belt on Friday after an 8 week wait and it looks like a quality product.  I am selling it because I have put on some lbs and started carrying a larger gun as well as a mag IWB.  The belt still fits with all that, but just barely.  If you wear all your gear comfortably in a size 36 pants you should be fine.  SOE turnaround is currently 8-12 weeks.    $65 paypal will get it shipped priority to you.

35bu5h	-13074	1431117016	DirecTV	Help with bill/mini-rant?	I've been with DirecTV about 2 years and a few months.  My bill has gone from $60ish to now $130ish.  The only reason I keep DirecTV is for Sunday Ticket.  I have no clue why directv uses the "Call and ask us for credits and promotions and we'll give you a discount for 6 months."  Why not just send a bill...make it one reasonable price and keep it that way?  It seems like at least 10 times out of the year I'm calling asking why my bill has gone back up (This month it's $161 because of something they did to lower last months bill.  Next month back to $130.)I called last month and lowered my package to Choice from Extra, I keep HBO for Game of Thrones but they won't offer me just HBO...I have to get all the movie channels (which also makes zero sense).  I know there are several DirecTV reps here as well as knowledgeable customers.  Can anyone give me an idea on how to lower my bill more?  Are there workarounds to this?  Is an option to cancel it in my name and reconnect it in my wifes name in order to get new customer pricing?  I know people who allegedly call once a week and activate HBO for game of thrones and then cancel it Monday, I don't want to do that.  Ideally I'd like to keep it around $100.  I don't think this is possible and I'll probably have to end up switching to comcast (who I already pay $75 for internet) to save $50-60 a month..

Been coming to OBX for a few years regularly but I'm wondering if there are any spots to eat with a beach view that maybe overlook the beach.  I can't find any thing on google.  I know there are restaurants right on the sound like Millers.  About 10 years ago my uncle took me to a bar that had an outdoor patio with live music and it was right on the beach.  I cannot for the life of me remember the name of it, if it's even still there. Edit: We'll be staying close to Goombays, if that helps.

Jeepit, I'm looking for some wheels to replace my rusty ol' [AR 767's](http://pptac.http.internapcdn.net/pptac/imagesProducts4/13077.jpg) I bought when I first got my jeep long long ago.

Was also curious if anyone has any experience with these [Quadratec](http://www.quadratec.com/products/92615_22X0_PG.htm) wheels.  The gunmetal caught my eye.I'm guessing those will do just fine for my use but was looking for other options and ideas as well.

I have been thinking of events that we may reach which will cause the end of the road for us.1) The clock goes to 999:99 which may end the game although I am not 100% sure.2) We get to Cinnabar island and when using the PC release any and all Pokemon that know/can learn fly and surf and we will be stuck there.3) We revive the Helix Fossil (Hail) and we release it from the PC in which case the world will most likely end.Edit to the original post after a few comments - point 1 is invalid and as for point 2, even with a rod we can always run out of money and pokeballs. Point 3 is always a threat and always will be.

2bsrnn	-13083	1406401422	Marvel	Advise me on some story arcs and reading order!	Hey Marvel Fans,Recently decided to get into the world of comic books after picking up some of the new DC stuff and would like your advice on some marvel things!First off I'm mostly interested in the Graphic Novel collections rather than individual comics themselves because they're much easier to store and keep in a good condition.. (I'm a filthy casual I know). As well as this I have a basic knowledge of most characters in the Marvel universe so I'm not a complete scrub.So onto my questions!Are there any Stories arc or world crossovers that I just have to read because of hoe good they are?I've been looking at World War Hulk and the Infinity Gauntlet story arcs and both look really interesting to me, could anyone here advise me on which books to start off with for both (Looking more so at the main story and If I enjoy them I could go back to the 'prequel' story as such, and the reading order if they both require multiple books to cover.Thanks for reading and any advice you give, much appreciated.

2jgoxg	-13083	1413499585	boogie2988	Boogie, What's going on?	Hey Boogie, wanted to post this here because its been in my mind for a while now and wanted to just let you know. First off, about a year ago I rediscovered your channel and got hooked on your videos, whenever you uploaded a new one I would rush to watch it where ever I was because I could always trust your opinion and views.. But, recently I feel like you have just gone off the rails a bit..I would class myself as a casual gamer, I'm currently studying to become a games developer but as anyone who has does it themselves should know, creating and playing games are different ends of the spectrum. So back to the point, when you started with this gamer gate stuff I was a little interested by it and did some reading only to realise that I couldn't trust any of the sources providing information on it because the people writing these articles, were gamers themselves who were on one side of Gamer Gate whether they wanted to be or even knew they were themselves. Now whenever I'm on twitter and want to hear about some gaming content I'll go to your twitter to see what one of my favourite YouTubers is talking about only to find a tweet expressing a view of yours and then another 50 following it apologising for what you said and trying to what explain what you meant which to be honest kinda seems like you aren't even sure that you believe what you just said.Now I understand that its an issue you feel very strongly about and I can sympathise with that and let you off but I feel like you have got so caught up in this Gamer Gate argument that your content, the thing that makes me want to hold onto the love I have for you and what you do is starting to slip..You started a new mini-show called WeGame, I loved this when It came out and have loved all the episodes since, seeing you state the honest truth about the industry and what it creates with the occasional joke and a couple of recommendations I can actually believe here and there was great. But where have they gone? The last one was two weeks ago, and that is a real shame.Your most recent video as I write this is a Francis video about "YouTube list videos".. It makes me wonder whether you actually wanted to make this video or whether you are scared to make a video bashing the industry as usual because of this Gamer Gate and how badly you have been treated as it goes on..I hope you understand that I'm not writing this to try to be negative or get you down rather than the usual comments you get but as a attempt to get back out Boogie who wasn't afraid to call out the biggest and most anticipated games of the year or the huge companies who make them, all from a chair in his office. You are just like any one of us, you love our shared hobby and will do anything to make sure we as the consumers get what we deserve from these people, all from your fucking office chair. You are the Hero that we as confused gamers that are told what we are and aren't so much that we begin to question ourselves need and deserve.So I beg of you Boogie, Please let go of all of this bullshit with you getting banned from websites and having to explain yourself to people who think they are important. You have rallied a following of 2 million people from telling the truth about this corrupt industry and we need you to continue doing so because without people like you, there won't be any decent games to play at all.I hope you see this and understand what I am trying to say.Regards from a big fan, Sam.

It sounds good and certainly works in the context of the song, but I can't work out *why* it sounds good. Any illumination you guys can provide would be appreciated. Anyway, here's the structure of the progression:A - Fmaj7 - A - Fmaj7 - Em - (A)Thanks!

2r3qvn	-13100	1420210459	Guitar	Strat grounding issue I can't figure out	Hey guys, I've got a G&amp;L Legacy (strat style guitar) that i'm having some buzzing issues with. There's obviously the normal amount of single coil hum, but there's also a loud, higher-pitched buzzing that stops whenever my hands touch any piece of metal on the guitar. I know a little bit about electronics and am pretty sure this is a grounding issue. I should note that all three pickups sound loud and strong and the switching works perfectly. This has me even more certain that the issue is with the ground path.So, last night I took the faceplate off of the guitar to check out some of the wiring. Everything looked good, more or less, so I pulled out the multimeter to check for continuity. Essentially, I checked for continuity between these items:Body of pots to all other potsBody of all pots to bridgeBody of all pots to sleeve of output jackoutput jack to bridgeHere's the thing: I don't know how to check the pickup ground connections. All three pickups around ground to the body of the volume pot, but I don't know how to check that the connections are good there because I don't know what to actually touch on the pickup to check for continuity.Phew. Hope that made a bit of sense. If anyone could help me out with any suggestions I'd be very appreciative. Thanks everyone!

My question is as follows: Without getting into spoilers, will I see an ending when i finish the main quest, and see the rest when I finish all of the other stuff, or is it more like i'll see a bad/suboptimal ending when I finish the main quest if the other things haven't been finished. I hope the question is clear. Thanks everyone!

Basically, I went to start it one day and I started seeing ALL kinds of crazy lights in the dash, my gauge cluster display started showing "Error ESP" and rapidly flashing on and off, and my car wouldn't start. Eventually got it to start with some liberal application of the throttle.After all of this, the car runs perfectly well once started. Anyway, now the car starts, but always tries to turn over once, lurches, I give it some gas, electric functions come back on and the car starts.I've taken the car to autozone just to get them to check the battery, and it's fine. My next step is to take it to my specialty shop in town. I'm wondering if anyone here has experienced this/knows what this is/knows what i'm in for, etc. Any information is greatly appreciated.

I press space bar to regroup my squad and the above "Whoops! Too far away" crap ensues with a black screen. :/

I work most of the day and really only have late night to run end game content. So I am curious how active Gilgamesh's party finder is during the late night times (US: 11PM~5AM PST).
30oz87	-13125	1427631617	evenewbies	Bunch of newbie questions	Hi /r/evenewbies First let me say I've had an EVE account for over two years but despite this never could stay committed with the game so always ended up quitting. I'm basically a newbie with an oldish account here.. Anyway, few questions:1. **Do I haveto do the agent missions?** I personally find these damn boring. When I first started playing EVE I thought I'd do a lot of mission grinding to move my way up in the game but found myself quickly not being able to tolerate doing it so quit.2. I want to get in to PVP BUT I don't got any clones right now and am stuck in an NPC corp with low standings across the aboard. What can I do to get access to cloning facilities so I can PVP without fear of getting podded and losing my skills?3. Reading up on stuff about the game I've become aware this game allows multiboxing and people that PVP [something I wanna get in to] abuse scout multis a lot to make their "EVE life" easier. **Is using multiple accounts required for PVP or EVE in general?** I'm really not too thrilled at the idea of shelling out lots of money to be on even footing tbh if so.4. Oddball question but how good is Isk making with faction warfare? I'm really tempted to try it out but curious if it's profitable.
3115fl	-13125	1427874384	evenewbies	PVP Questions	Hey again. Ok so back again here with more questions. All PVP oriented this time.1. Is 200m enough to get started? It's the amount I currently got and I know my ships are gonna get blown up at first learning how to actually PVP good.2. Recommend good Caldari missile ships &amp; fits. Heavy and Light Missile tech is what I got atm mostly. T1/T2 ships preferred. Try and keep fits and ships to cheap ones if possible. I don't got billions to blow through unfortunately.3. What's a good "rotation" for starting PVP with? Sorry if I'm not phrasing this right.. but I mean like: *Lock on &gt; Get in range/align ship for getaway if needed &gt; Warp Scramble &gt; pew?*4. I suck at probing and dscan. Any information you all can provide on getting better at this stuff so I can not only find juicy targets I can warp to [I often get low signal fyi.] and know when shit is coming for me so I know when to gtfo?5. What's a good way for entering and surviving dangerous galaxies? May seem like an odd question but I'm a guy that usually autopilots in high sec. I know it's dangerous to do that in low sec of course.. and wouldn't do that. BUT, I'd still like information on the best practices for entering hostile galaxies. Example if I'm not clear enough: Would: *Enter from gate &gt; Align to moon &gt; Warp be a good thing to do after entering a hostile galaxy?*Thanks again.
35nyj7	-13125	1431394358	summonerschool	Looking to be a better support or bust	Hey /r/summonerschool. I'm posting today because I'm in a bit of a slump as far as wins go when I play support.I feel I have gotten the following down pretty well: * I can deal with aggressive supports like Thresh, Blitzcrank, Leona just fine. However my ADC usually gets grabbed a lot. I'd like to prevent that but I feel that's mostly their fault for standing in one sport or not behind their minions. A way I deal with Leona early game is peel her to make her more defensive but I find it harder to do that to Blitzcrank.* Peeling - I do this VERY well early game often forcing the enemy bot lane to back by level 6, lest they risk dying. A single Sona Q with a power chorded Q auto can do a stupid amount of damage. It however unfortunately very rarely leads to them dying.* I keep an eye on my ADC's CS and the enemy ADC's CS. If I notice mine is less than the other teams, I'll pick up the tempo and start being MUCH more aggressive. If my aggressiveness fails and they keep the CS advantage I'll admit I do tend to rage at my ADC for not doing well there.* Ward &amp; De-ward. I keep dragon warded, both bushes and at 20 minute mark keep a pink on baron.* I tend to not "feed" at all laning phase but post laning I do tend to die when I'm doing my warding runs.* Obviously I try to let the ADC get kills when possible and only go HAM when the fight is tough and it's possible for an enemy to escape with &lt; 100 HP.But despite the above I find that my lane loses often due to very well done ganks from the enemy Jungler, or not being able to keep up the momentum past level 6. Because then - the enemy ADC usually has an item or two and starts hurting like hell so me peeling away at them isn't as easy as it used to be.What exactly is going wrong here with my play? Is it not scoring the kills early game and letting them B back? If so... what are some ways on securing those kills without Ultimates? **Note: I already run exhaust and use it.****PS: Sorry for WoT. :s**

Same thing could be done to Anivia, too.**

38tjut	-13125	1433614662	leagueoflegends	Anyone else feel ZZ'Rot Portal is a little underpowered?	Title. I really like the concept of the item and its stats are nice too. However when I use it to "passively" push a lane with after I give it a good push [IE: Clear it myself and then use its active] almost always the enemy laner goes to their lane, pushes it back and then kills the portal.My only real success with this item is giving myself extra siege power when I am actively trying to take down a tower myself.Am I doing it wrong or.. do others feel it's a little underpowered as well?

395r2j	-13125	1433856188	leagueoflegends	It would seem the days of getting refunds are over for things you buy before they go on sale.	^ Title. I opened a support ticket after I noticed Gnar was on sale because I had bought him several weeks prior at full price. I wanted to see if I could get some of the RP refunded back to my account. I'd noticed other people doing this on Reddit and it worked for them so why not?I gave it a try and apparently with the introduction of the sales schedules feature on the website Riot will no longer offers refunds to people for things that go on sale anymore. It doesn't matter if you bought the Champion/Skin before the schedule went live either.[Screenshot of the ticket](https://i.imgur.com/bPHV4XU.jpg)Oh well. At least I got a good top laner. :3

10n5hk	-13128	1348872412	tipofmytongue	[TOMT][SONG] "It was a good, good..."	We had an iPod on in the background today in my printmaking class, and I briefly caught a song playing that I'd heard once on the radio a few months ago. It sounded like it was maybe by Cee Lo Green or Gnarls Barkley, but so far I'm having no luck with Google. Basically the only lyrics I know from it is the line, "It was a good, good..." (Day? Thing?) I think it also says something like, "He was a bad, bad man," - the "bad, bad" part at least. It's not a particularly upbeat song...kind of chill-sounding, but somewhat like a lamentation. And it's gonna drive me crazy if I can't figure out what it is.
11ebbu	-13128	1350094238	explainlikeimfive	ELI5: Why are people from some very cold regions light-skinned, while in others they have darker skin?	So, people who live nearer to the Equator tend to have darker skin because of the amount and intensity of the sunlight. But why is it that, for example, Scandinavian people have very light hair, skin, and eyes, but Inuits do not?I ask this question because I want one of the two main characters for my National Novel Writing Month book to be a person of color, but I don't know what would make more sense for the guy who's from a (fictional) mountainous region with snow on the ground almost year-round.

25eubc	-13128	1399944754	SkyrimHelp	[PC] Cannot complete final leg of Falskaar main questline	After completing the siege of Staalgarde, my group of npcs stops at the gate at the edge of the property. If I disable the gate, they walk to a random spot on the western edge of the area and just stand around. Waiting for an hour or two causes them to phase through the gate, but they are nowhere to be found upon reaching the gate to Mountain Mist Temple, and waiting 24+ hours does not cause them to appear. I have tried moving them to me while at the gate via console commands, but they just stand around once again, and waiting at that point just makes them disappear. I've even gone back to the very beginning of the Staalgarde battle and done it all over again, but nothing changed. I'm not well-versed with console commands, so maybe there's some easy solution to this that I'm just not getting? I would appreciate any suggestions!

2gwq4x	-13128	1411171046	Atlanta	Rant: Harassment from random dudes about dent in car	Got in a minor accident earlier this year, and this is the first time I've ever driven around with a dented car so perhaps this is something that occurs all over and I've just never been aware of it. But what the fuck is with these guys accosting me in the middle of traffic trying to convince me to pay them to fix the dent?! The Kroger parking lot was one thing, but today was the second time some sleazy douchebag has literally tried to stop the flow of traffic to tout their services. He then proceeded to pull up beside me and scream slurs and obscenities. We were almost at our destination, and I was briefly afraid that he was going to follow us and I was going to get the shit beaten out of me.What the fuck. Seriously. Why are people doing this. Does it ever actually work? Why in the fuck would I just be like, "Oh, sure, random asshole, have some money! I'm sure you do top-notch work, or else you wouldn't go around harassing people about it!" Is it a con, or what? And most importantly, how do I get these guys to leave me the fuck alone?! At this point, even if I a.) cared about the dent and b.) had the money to fix it, I probably wouldn't simply on principle. I'm seriously about to put a sticker on it that says "fuck off" or something.

Not much of a fan of his screamier, more dissonant stuff, but love stuff that is heavy and has driving beats. I've listened to and enjoyed The Dresden Dolls, IAMX (though I haven't heard the most recent album), and Rasputina, but I find the former two a little too "cabaret" and not enough "dark," and Rasputina extremely hit and miss because of how weird some of it is, and because I find the singer's voice offputting.

371tzp	-13128	1432432748	furry	What are your thoughts on furry novels?	I'm talking specifically about novels written by and for furries, not things like Redwall or Warriors. I've got a fantasy story I've been kicking around for a while that I think could be really good as a furry novel, but I honestly don't know much about what's already out there, or how it's perceived. All I've read myself is Basecraft Cirrostratus by Rose LaCroix, which I thought was okay, but not great. I know I've at least got to check out Kyell Gold. I've heard nothing but good things, and I'm interested to see what the industry standard is, so to speak. A few questions for ya'll:Outside of Gold, what other authors/books would you recommend? I am particularly interested in fantasy, of course.What have you liked about the furry novels you've read? What have you disliked? Any pet peeves?What makes you decide to buy a furry novel? Are there any factors that would immediately make you decide that you do or do not want to read one?How do you feel about sex scenes? How important are they? How frequent do you like them to be? How graphic are they in general/how graphic do you think they should be? How do you think a single narrative with both gay and straight sex scenes would be received?I'd be interested in your thoughts on this stuff even if you've never read one! What would get you to read one?

He and his friend had asked two girls to go with them and they were all going to ride together.  These two girls had been leading them on about going and telling the boys how excited they were.  My son bought the tickets and then yesterday, the girl came up to him and said it was just a joke.  She was never going with him and was going with someone else.  She and her friends just thought it would be funny to let him think she would go with him.  His heart was broken.  As a dad, I feel awful because there is just nothing I can do to fix this.  I let him know that junior high girls can be just awful.  I just don't understand how parents can let their little girls think that it is ok to be this awful.  I'm just venting.Edit1:  Thank you all for the wonderful responses. He had a great time at the movies tonight.  He went to see Insurgent.  I am really grateful that he and I have a wonderful relationship where we can talk these issues through.  Unfortunately, I really don't know how to get in touch with the parents without turning this into a big deal.  I don't want him to suffer blowback on account of her actions.

So rant over, how am I supposed to fly this thing? Or is it one of those planes you have to spade for it to be worth a damn?

I get to wait	Nothing like waiting on a 3 minute crew lock after technically getting shot down right guys?Seriously though I understand the reasoning behind this mechanic, but it's so badly bugged that it shouldn't be implemented. If people really don't want to play they don't care if their crew gets locked, they simply won't play. Just take it out and let us return to our old, glorious ways of flight.It's also terribly implemented in ground forces.I have faith that Gaijin is a competent developer, but come on guys you're letting me and a lot of the player base down with these kinds of things. Please do something about it

What changed is that recently I've had bad news health wise plus I graduate college next year and the last thing I want is to be held back by poor health and negative self-image at a time when my life is meant to be beginning.  Now I have the mindset my lack of knowledge regarding exercise is the only real thing holding me back.  So what I'm asking is does anyone have any sort of advice for putting together an exercise plan and what I should be focused on?Thanks for reading

2pxo33	-13160	1419125092	dragonage	[SPOILERS] So I just finished my first play-through of Inquisition...	Some information first:* Character: Pandora Trevelyan, Knight Enchanter* Playtime: 80:35* Level: 24* Influence: 16So yeah as you can see I made a pretty serious dent into the game's content: I've killed every dragon, there are only shard related quests left and I have 233 power left over so here are my impressions:* I'm playing on PS4 so obviously it won't compare to some of you PC users bit aesthetically I found most of the environments gorgeous and there was a lot of scale and diversity to the point where I never used a mount because I enjoyed exploration so much* From a technical aspect loading screens were very quick but I had some niggling audio issues where it would crack and stutter, this happened throughout the entirety of the fade section in "Here lies the abyss" also there was a graphical issue with the tier 3 Battlemage Armour arms where one would stick out like a shoulder pad as opposed to lie flat attached to the Inquisitor's arm.  Also I haven't gotten the achievement Dragon's Bane but I assume that's a bug that'll be fixed.  Aside from these issues a great experience* Combat wise I had a lot of fun and I was nervous about it being me just spamming the spectral blade and resetting barrier but there's a lot of versatility if you're looking for it* Characters have always been Bioware's strong point and Inquisition is no different, I'd speak to my companions every possible second hoping to hear something new and the party banter is excellent * The soundtrack is amazing and the entire sequence leading up to the discovery of Skyhold left me with chills* Onto Skyhold I wish they did more with it, the 3 potential upgrades you get to pick from offer nothing special and that's unfortunate because it had a lot of promise* The final battle was a bit meh if I'm honest, I kind of wish I got something like ME2's suicide mission with choices being imperative to success and we spent this time building a small army of some of the most dangerous people in Thedas bit we never mobilise them.In closing I had a fantastic experience with the game and can't wait to dive into another play-through (after I explore multiplayer and write my dissertation) and I cannot wait for some DLC.  People have a lot of hangups about Dragon Age 2 and concerns but I can safely say Dragon Age: Inquisition is definite redemption.

2z8jqo	-13160	1426517799	SampleSize	[Academic] Attitudes and Values attached to Teamwork (Business Students and Recent Business Graduates)	Hey I'm a 4th year Management student at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland and I urgently need replies for a survey on team work and attitudes towards it.  The study has been given ethical approval by my university.  Here is a passage explaining why I'm undertaking this research:This involves understanding how students relate to collaboration and teamwork and the value they place upon it as a means of solving business problems.  Given the emphasis on group work in an academic setting this is key as this emphasis will likely have an impact on organisational culture as students transition into the corporate world. The main aim of the research proposal is to explore collaboration in problem solving and how students relate to it. The survey is anonymous and if you do the survey could you send me a PM because I have people I know who have taken this so it's nice to keep it in check.

I enjoyed the content and it was nice to see a previously unexplored aspect of the lore.

2txat7	-13161	1422416868	Trucking	Unscientific Study: Are You a Truck Driver or a CDL Driver?	I don't know why I find this interesting. But I do.I set up two Google News Alerts for the terms CDL Driver and Truck Driver.  The term Truck Driver is always attached to negative story. A murdered hooker or an accident. The term CDL Driver is always associated with someone seeking the services of a truck driver. They're very polite when they need a driver to do something. Please help me. Mister CDL driver.I don't think truck drivers call themselves CDL drivers. They're truck drivers. They might soften the stereotype by saying they "drive truck" for a living. It's similar to the guilty feeling when you say "that Mexican guy over there". The guy's from Mexico. It shouldn't be offensive. That guy's a truck driver. He drives a truck. It's shouldn't be negative.We could take this two ways. Truck drivers should be proud of their heritage. They should celebrate with pride on Dieciocho de Mayo.Or, they should distance themselves from their negative past and call themselves CDL drivers. The CDL added credibility to the profession in 1991. The government set standards for truck drivers. They created a certification to be recognized across the country. A CDL Driver can do things that other people can't. Anybody can drive a truck. But, only certified people can drive a CDL vehicle. A back doctor was a witch doctor until they came up with the term Chiropractor.What do you tell your friends? When they ask about your work.I'm a CDL Driver.I'm a Truck Driver.I drive trucks.

It got caught in a stream and fell into a waterfall.  He tried to dive in to save it, but we stopped him.  As I told Mr. Francis, some days my friends and I think it would've been better if he had just fallen down that stream and died, since he's been an unbearable dick ever since.Anyway, I've been having a lot of trouble getting that hat, and I want to have it before my friend's birthday, which is coming up fairly soon.Please PM me if you have this hat and are willing to sell, and we can discuss the details.Yalla Habibi ya'll.

It sucks because I feel like this journey is never ending but today I got my first 4 injections and let me tell you, IT HURTS LIKE HELL! They inject it right on the scar itself and you feel an intense pinch like if someone was pinching an active cystic acne and then you feel an intense burn as the liquid enters your skin and makes your skin expand and swell up. Oh my God it was so painful I cried. But I guess I'll see how that worked! Next month I go back in for my last pregnancy test and another round of steroid shots.

2uwvej	-13239	1423170717	relationships	Me [22 F] with my boyfriend [26 M] of 18 months, I am jealous and insecure of his past.	So my boyfriend and I met 18 months ago and hit it off. We both said from the beginning we were looking for something serious and everything seemed to go smoothly. We love each other and talk about getting married once he finishes grad school in 3 years. About my past: I dated a guy from 16 to 20 but we kept in touch until I was about 21. We then stopped talking once I found "Fred" and everything has been smooth sailing. The issue: He told me he has had previous relationships and I obviously understand that since we all have dated before in the past. What I feel so insecure about is one girl he dated when he was a sophmore in college and apparently they were best friends for 2-3 years and dated for 6 months. He said he loved her when he had told me I was the second girl he had told I love you to. (His first was his first girlfriend at 16-17). He then goes to tell me that the girl from sophmore year was a bigger girl and from then on, everything about that relationship makes me feel insecure. I am 5'5 and weigh about 140lbs. So I am not stick thin but I do not consider myself overweight either. By the way he describes his ex she was about 180-200 pounds or so. By the way, he is 5'9 weighing at 144 so he is a thin guy. I have asked him if he wants me to be bigger because that is not something I am aiming to do. I have been working out and want to lose about 15-20 pounds. He says he loves my body and blah blah blah but for some reason, I replay him telling me about his bigger girlfriend all the time. I know I am incredibly insecure but I have always been wanting to lose weight all my life. This is the biggest I have ever been and to think that he was attracted to someone bigger, makes me feel like even if I lose weight, it won't matter because he has dated bigger girls than me. Do I sound crazy? I have tried to talk to friends about this both boys and girls and I get different advice. I want to know if I am thinking too much about this and just letting it get to my head. Fred and I met when I was 21 and he was 24 and he said the last girlfriend he had was a girl who was also bigger (180ish) but they didn't have sex. The last person he had sex with was the bigger girl from sophmore year. I just feel so weird and off about the whole situation. I am in no way against big people but I feel insecure that maybe I am not the body type he is looking for. He did say he dated a girl in college that was a swimmer so I am guessing she was thinner.I am sorry everything is all over the place. I am just typing as I am having thoughts. We are both very open when it comes to porn and he has mentioned how sometimes he watches "chubby" girls. That in itself made me lose it and we had a talk that ended in him saying he watched "chubby" categories as much as he watches "brunettes" or "MILFS". That it is just something to mix it up and it doesnt represent him wanting to be with a big girl. Reddit, please let me know if I am just being insecure or overthinking everything. I am probably just creating a problem that isnt even there. ---   **tl;dr**: Boyfriend has dated a bigger girl. I am not overweight. I feel insecure about him having dated someone that is the complete opposite of what I strive to be like (weight wise).

2ejt96	-13244	1408990143	Briggs	(Server Smash) Pilot scrimmage Thursday 28th of August.	Hey guys, some of you might not know but i am going to be leading the Briggs pilots on the day of Server Smash. I will be arranging different scrimmages or practices before the event separate from the main Briggs practices. Although i will be at the main Briggs practices as well.This Thursday will be our first scrimmage, starts at 9pm eastern standard time to possibly get NZ and WA peeps on at the same time. Times can change depending on what suits people, and this is the first of many so if you cant make it on the day or the time there will be other chances.Also as a heads up, we have a list of 65 pilots who have committed already, if you don't attend to show what you can do there are 64 other pilots who will and we aren't bringing 65 pilots.We will be using the Briggs Communal Teamspeak in the Misty Mountains channel for all scrimmages or practices i run.Address is:   128.199.255.5.If you haven't already put your name down as a pilot for Server Smash add it to MewMewTRs post which i check daily. http://www.reddit.com/r/Briggs/comments/2ecg0e/server_smash_briggs_aviation_air_roster/For any info on the Air for Server Smash contact me, MewMewTR or Acherlon/AshesofRedemption
2ewskz	-13244	1409312620	Briggs	SS Air Scrimage Saturday 5pm (Eastern Time)	Hey guys doing a scrim again for the pilots committed to the server smash Saturday. We had 42 people in teamspeak for last nights one which is a crazy good turnout. Doing an earlier one to make it easier for our NZ friends. Practice wont be longer than an hour so peeps can go back to flying/shooting down Valkyries.Again as always we will be on the Briggs Communal teamspeak. Also dont forget the main Briggs practice Sunday morning.
2f389m	-13244	1409500375	Briggs	(Server Smash) Air Division Practice Tuesday 2nd of September at 8pm EST.	Great turnouts to the last few scrims and trainings guys. More practices will be held, but this Tuesdays one is to try and finalize who we are bringing so we can work on specific things for the day of the Smash. Ive already made a roster of first and 2nd choice players we will be taking based on practicality of pilot and attendances over the past week.This doesn't apply to those who have let me know about not being able to attend due to RL stuff. I will give you guys a fair chance like everyone else. But that doesn't guarantee a position either.
2fd82n	-13244	1409760572	Briggs	Server Smash Air training Thursday 4th of September at 8pm AEST.	Absolute last training before cut off, got a rough idea of pilots we will be taking, just to finalize what players based on attendance and skill set suiting the tactics we need. Might be my last post about this on reddit as ill let the pilots know who got in through the different ways they mentioned that suits them.
2fs81h	-13244	1410153748	Briggs	SS Air Division Meeting tonight 8pm AEST.	To all the fly guys that have put their hand up for SS, we are having a short meeting tonight on the communal teamspeak, followed by scrims on Briggs or a trip to Emerald TR to mess with Prey or QRY. Ill be giving out info on the final roster on whos going, positions arent cemented yet, so guys on the reserve list can still make it. But wont be adding new names to that list as this week we will be trying to get this group ready.
2fw50h	-13244	1410254250	Briggs	SS Air Division short practice Wednesday 7.30pm AEST.	Just a quicky, guys are probably getting tired of pracs, but just want to keep them going to fit in guys who couldn't make previous ones.
2g3auu	-13244	1410430498	Briggs	SS Air Division Final days before Server Smash.	Hey guys, most things are organised, no need to worry about stuff except for the last minute stuff like handing out accounts. *Friday 12th of September at 8pm AEST* will be our last practice. Not mandatory as player list is finalized but ill run it for some guys who want a bit more practice or info.*Saturday 13th of September at 6:30 AEST* we will have a briefing for those that might not know exact details, and for me to potentially hand out your accounts. On the day i will have a short briefing to iron out any problems or misunderstandings.For peeps who cant attend those dates and need info, you should know how to find me by now so ill give you info that way.
2g7uav	-13244	1410542903	Briggs	SS Air Division Briefing tonight at 6.30pm AEST. Urgent!	Every pilot in the Air Division should be there, wont take long but every pilot needs to be informed on what we will be doing. Meet on the Briggs Teamspeak or on the QRC Teamspeak.This is not a training, or recruitment and only for pilots attending!
2gfz17	-13244	1410770589	Briggs	Cheers to all Pilots for yesterday.	Yesterday match as leader of the Briggs Air Machine was the hardest grind for a win that I've ever played in. I want to say thank you to all the pilots who flew on the day, you guys did everything i asked even if i didn't have time to explain it. Our Reaver guys fought against twice our numbers, and with that gave breathing room for A2G guys to hurt Connery ground bad.As for the pilots who came to training's, but couldn't play on the day, had ground obligations or made it onto the reserve list. I thank you guys as well, you helped us really prepare for this event with your expertise or even just attendance helping us practice larger fights.Cheers to the TCFB squad who helped out when they could. At one stage pulled a Reaver hero squad to help us out when we had low resources. Really made a huge difference when you guys were up, even a commentator said this "Wow, and Briggs have pulled an enormous amount of air, its over a platoon worth of aircraft". When in reality it was the only time we matched Connery's air numbers.Also thanks to my squad leaders, you helped run things smoothly, gave me tips when i needed them, or gave me extra intel. You made the match a lot easier for me to lead.I would like to name my MVP, a lot of you guys tore up, some weren't able to due to your role and i understand that but i would still like to mention this guy. My MVP is Danoli3, top 20 for individual kills, at one stage had a KD of 14 before the tree incidents, but most importantly took out 4 squad leaders and 4 beacons at the start of the match at the satellites around Acan bio lab. Which i believe assisted in Briggs walking in and walking out of Acan bio without a shot fired. Danoli you will receive a Mars bar in the mail shortly.And finally a message to yesterdays Connery air from me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GZS5Z2Ipt8
2hltb9	-13244	1411812154	Briggs	For QRC and KORN members.	Hey I know it's hard to get a hold of some of the QRC and KORN members when they're not online in PS2. So I'm putting this on Reddit, hopefully those peeps will see this. We're going to be having a meeting later in the week. QRC people just talk to me, KORN guys just try to get a hold of TekniQ, we are going to give you guys information on what's going on.Hopefully this goes smoothly although it shouldn't be a problem based on how we got along this past month.
2jara1	-13244	1413357793	Briggs	SS Air Division leadership	Hey pilot people, looking for anyone who is interested in leading the Air Division for the next SS. I'm happy to do it again but would like too see if there are any peeps out there are keen to lead as well. Perhaps even to jointly organize it just in case something happens to me for future events.
2l1skx	-13244	1414913854	Briggs	Briggs Air Roster for next Server Smash	I'm writing down the names of interested pilots who want to be flying verse Emerald on Sunday 23rd of November. Most pilots know/talk to each other so I'm asking you peeps to spread the word as some don't use reddit. Put down your name if interested or of someone you know who is interested that doesn't use reddit, as well as what days and time you can attend practice and please add your timezone or make it AEST otherwise i will just assume you are in Sydney (this is generally when you are free, i understand hot dates do occur).That way i can figure out best times to get certain people to play together and do trainings. I want us organised, way more than last time, the Pilots who can do what is required of them better than the others is who i will be bringing.
2ld0t3	-13244	1415190697	Briggs	Server Smash Air practice, Friday 7th of November at 8pm (AEST)	Time is 8pm AEDT guys (or Sydney-Melbourne time), didn't realize the name change sorry for any confusion.Going to do some big fights so we get used to server smash style of dogfights. All pilots are welcome, even if you aren't attending the match. Probably will be the last time ill be taking names down for those interested in flying in the smash.Meet up on the Briggs communal teamspeak: 128.199.255.5.
2ln1sd	-13244	1415413523	Briggs	Final call for interested pilots to fly against Emerald.	Want to start finalizing rosters, and working on what we will be doing with the group we have. Reminder the fight is on the 23rd of November, Sunday 12pm Sydney time. If you have put your name down already, don't worry about putting it down on this page :P
2lqxg4	-13244	1415520412	Briggs	SS Air Training Tuesday and Thursday 8pm (Sydney time) this week.	I've reserved the Jaeger server (with heaps of help from Azure) for pilots to train without any disturbances. All types of pilots (gal,lib,esf) are asked to attend, i want some basic tactics understood. Meet on the Briggs TS a bit earlier if possible, as we need to be giving out accounts. If any of you guys delete any of the characters given to you, not only will you and your outfit members get banned from SS, i will use my personal skill set that I've acquired over many years to find you, and gank you (in PS2).Also we have some Euro pilots on our server that cant make it to training's due to time difference. If i can find enough interest i will hold late night training's for those guys. If anyone has those kind of pilots in their outfits or friends list please let them know.
2mg7gf	-13244	1416121966	Briggs	SS Air Division final week information.	Last week before our match on Sunday the 23rd against Emerald at 1pm AEDT. Wanted to let pilots know what the final preparations will be.**Monday**: 8-11pm Sydney time general training (longer training times so people can hop in mid way through or leave early to help out with timezone difference)**Wednesday**: 8-10PM Sydney time, general training and short briefing.**Friday**: 8pm Sydney time and also at 12 midnight Sydney time i will hold a tactical briefing (shouldn't go for to long). Will also start to hand out accounts (Do not delete any characters given to you).**Saturday**: 9pm Sydney time, very short basic training and quick final briefing also will be handing out final accounts (Do not delete any characters given to you).**Sunday**: Rape face at 1pm Sydney time, be online one hour prior to start makes it a lot easier when having to deal with so many people also players late will get subbed, cant guarantee you will get a chance to play after that. Final accounts will be given out prior to start as well.Besides me, *PsychicMoose* and *Kitarix* will have access to the accounts, so feel free to ask them for info, try to grab them on Friday and Saturday because they can take over an hour to cert up the way you like/need it. Pilots who have attended the briefings don't have to worry about going to other meetings, as i will probably be saying the same thing again and it will just be awkward if you enjoy listening to my voice.I want to finalize the roster of who we are taking by tonight/tomorrow, there could be some tweaks so don't get to disheartened if you aren't in the final roster yet. I need to still get a hold of a few people so nothing wont be really set in stone until Wednesday night.
2myy83	-13244	1416560663	Briggs	Air Division briefing tonight	Got a tactical meeting in a few minutes, got another one at midnight Sydney time. Meetings wont go for long.Also will have one tomorrow night for those busy tonight.
2n55qb	-13244	1416718962	Planetside	Great server smash, credit to Emerald air from me the Briggs Air platoon leader.	
2n6jq9	-13244	1416765374	Briggs	Message to Briggs and BAM.	I would like to thank everyone who participated or helped in preparing us against Emerald. From the guys who fought, to the admin peeps and even those who came to practices even if they knew they couldn't participate on the day.You ground guys, you were clutch, you fought for every inch and not once complained that we were losing. Just kept your heads down and kept pummeling to the glorious end. That is a group i would fight with any day. When i played on the ground from what i saw i could see you guys pressing with nostrils flaring like a beast catching the scent of a wounded animal, or holding each building as if your really hot girlfriend was inside waiting to "repay" you for your bravery. You guys were absolutely amazing.To the Briggs Air Machine, some of you might not know this but about 4-5 weeks ago when we had Emerald pilots come to Briggs and be douche-bags, that i got mad. I made a promise then, that when we verse Emerald i will fuck them deep into the ground. Today we accomplished this, when we blacked out the sun with our a banshees. You guys used initiative when needed too and worked with each squad extremely well. Everyone knew their job and did it, and even swapped out roles pre and mid fight when circumstances changed. So i thank you for having faith in me and for listening to every order that me or your squad leader gave. I'm proud of all of you and for what we accomplished against a team that has never lost to any server prior to 24 hours ago.Cheers guys, and thanks for letting me lead the [Briggs Air Machine](http://imgur.com/5KFq2WH).
2new43	-13244	1416951379	Briggs	Pilot roster for next Server Smash match in the 3 way against Miller and Cobalt.	Starting up the recruitment for the Briggs Air Machine for the Saturday December 13th match, which will start at 11pm AEDT (Sydney time).So put your names down if you are interested. All pilots are welcome, especially since we struggled to get solid numbers last time. Alternatively contact me in game. I prefer on here so then i don't forget to write your names down when I'm showing off my reverse maneuvers to a br10 in warpgate.Also like last time if anyone else wishes to lead the air, even on a squad level or just help with running trainings put your hand up. I'm happy to give anyone a chance or follow orders myself.
2nn8yu	-13244	1417155060	Briggs	BAM Server Smash sign up sheet.	2nd roll call for interested pilots, if you have put your name down on the other one don't worry about this post. Its just here for the peeps who might not of seen the last one.
2o0jju	-13244	1417494296	Briggs	Briggs Air Machine SS training Wednesday 3rd of December at 8pm AEDT.	General training, just so peeps get to know each other. Most pilots are familiar with what needs to be done in SS, but will go over some basic stuff for the less experienced pilots who might not know yet. But generally will just do some 1v1s and small group fights.Hopefully ill get Jaeger accounts but the SS people are busy past few days so its no guarantee. 
2ocnfb	-13244	1417771859	Briggs	BAM SS Training, Saturday 9pm AEDT	I've almost got the group finalized, i know how many spots we have now to use, and a rough understanding on how we are asked to play. Some pilots are on the fringe of getting in or being left out so ill be checking you guys out during training. For the guys who don't make it in, i apologize its a crap feeling, but i will try to get you in next time which I've done in the past with other pilots.I'm holding training a bit later so peeps can still play with their outfits at prime time, but if its to late for some let me know.Meet on the Briggs Teamspeak like always: ts3.planetside2.com.auAlso for those who don't know we will be playing Vanu on the day.
2olvpb	-13244	1418006413	Briggs	BAM Final week preparations for Server Smash 3 way.	We got a final training Wednesday at 8pm AEDT. And then Friday we have a tactical briefing/hand out accounts from 8pm AEDT. Ill be on most of the night Friday so if you cant make it that early its fine, but warning i do get cranky when i have to repeat myself all night which would mean i could put you on ammo Sundy duty. As always, meet on the Briggs TS.I should have the roster done in the next few days or even tonight. I'll try to contact you guys, but if you don't use reddit or have me on steam i will let people know on Wednesday. (*please pass this message on as i realize that people without reddit wont see this*)If some of you don't make it in don't get to disheartened, i pick on what leadership and me think would help our chance to win. Sometimes and often in the past we've had to choose between 2 equal pilots but only had 1 spot for their role. As well as this, last time we subbed in 5 players on the day, RL happens and people cant make it. So if you are online and in the reserve channel on the Server Smash TS, and we have someone missing 45mins prior to the start ill get you in instantly.Match start is December 13th, Saturday at 11pm AEDT, 10:30pm Adelaide, 10pm Queensland, 8pm Perth, 1pm Germany time.For info about BAM ask Zesurov (me), PsychicMoose or DyslexicSpartan.
2omn1y	-13244	1418024876	Briggs	Server Smash pre-match report!	
2p96u0	-13244	1418557595	Briggs	Message to Briggs and BAM.	First of all, we fucked them, well done! But great effort from [Cobalt and Miller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctr9ZfeyvXg) who really pushed for the win.Credit to Loki, his defensive cul-de-sacs and always giving us offensive options was masterful.To all the ground guys, you fought really well. I've watched 2 replays now and i was extremely impressed. I do apologize for not being able to give you the same air support as expected but very often we had to be at 3 places at the same time (i will give more info in the debriefs). This did anger me not being able to help though, and i'll try to figure out what i did wrong to improve this for next time.Finally to BAM, i don't have a single negative thing to say about any of you. You responded to orders quickly, you played ground when asked, i didn't hear a single complaint, you stayed in formations but took smart initiative. I asked at the start for discipline, to respond as quickly as possible, and you all impressed me. I was proud to lead you guys again.Shout out to TCFB, they really helped us in the first hour, i let them do their ground thing in the last 45mins or so and they were that annoying squad reinforcing our defenses or starting offensive options with ghost caps. I was going to call you guys up to fly a few times but you were doing a really great job and i just left you to your own devices.Also, the BAM Mech division that had AA set up in the south, you got pummeled hard, but it gave us that breathing room to go and push Miller. Those guys were hated, and had several organised forces try to take them out. As an example from the reports i got those 4 guys had the Cobalt air platoon bomb them on 3 occasions while the rest of us went to attack Miller. Here's some [footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q5rsQJpGV0) i found of what Cobalt did to them.All hail Briggs!
2ttoxr	-13244	1422349625	Briggs	Next SS match sign up for BAM.	We are going to have a tough match against Cobalt and that's just in the air. I've been asked to lead BAM again and I would like as many pilots as we got to sign up, Cobalt have the most successful airforce in Server Smash, what we did to Emerald in the sky, they did the same but in half the time. I've put my differences aside many times for BAM, i ask all of you Briggs pilots to do the same and participate. **So guys, please put your name down below of yourself, or any pilot you can speak for.**After a few matches organizing things I know now what too look for when finalizing rosters. So this is how i will be choosing pilots for this match, and potentially future matches. (Sorry its long, but i feel i need to make this public info)-I prefer to now take the experienced SS pilots, you guys know what to do now in those big dogfights, i can rely on you to listen to orders and to not show up late. -Pilots that have situational awareness and good positioning and cover their wingman will be favoured over the ones who are just good at 1v1s.-I like to rotate pilots for different matches, to share the experience, so just because you have attended before, if you are just on the fringe i can potentially bring in someone else to try them out.-Training attendance isn't mandatory, but i will be holding them again. Its there for those guys who aren't comfortable with bigger fights, who want to learn positional awareness, and to generally lose some rust if they haven't flown in a while in a safe environment.-Those pilots who i can see are more eager to fight for Briggs, who do attend practice will be favoured over those fringe pilots who don't. As well as that, the pilots who do attend practice, i can see their level of play and form, so i know exactly what type of pilot I'm bringing. Finally we need to bring a level of professionalism this is a competitive match after all, if you cant follow orders or aren't mature enough to play well with others i wont bring you in. Also i expect the more senior pilots to help out in training's and on Briggs, you have more knowledge about the air game than anyone so if you see someone making mistakes, help them out. We are at a stage now in PS2 life where we are getting the next generation of pilots so lets make it a bit easier for them. *(My estimate is we are at the 5th generation of pilots now)*Match is on the 21st of Febuary, Saturday night at 11pm AEDT[Official Dates](http://i.imgur.com/hPGqcaA.jpg)

The game is a few hours earlier than before but still on a Saturday night. We are going to have 2 air FCs, that wont be me, whoever they will be will use the roster with everyone who signed up and go by captains pick to keep the teams fair. So if you aren't interested in doing this match and want to play on an empty Briggs server then please put your name down that you cant make it to make our selection process easier.Also we don't have a pop limit, so if you want to sign up and haven't already put your name down below. I'm gonna be doing all the BAM admin stuff and am happy to take every pilot unless you are a douche who doesn't play well with others.Still deciding on BAM FCs, and I'm going to give them their own autonomy, but if people are interested, I'm considering holding a training to help guys out with basic principles in big fights, but it will be extremely generalized. Let me know if you are interested otherwise i wont worry.I have a few people i would like to FC, but anyone interested in leading a platoon of air yell out as well.
2wiha5	-13244	1424405411	Briggs	BAM Set up for Saturdays match.	Hey guys since its a bit hard to realize exactly who is playing on the day it was to tricky to set up rosters. So we will be picking the teams for BAM on the day. Our two leads will be Popemunky for VS and HoudiniESC for NC. Try to be on 90mins before the start of the match to make it easier on those guys and so we can hand out accounts to be ready in time. Ill be giving them out all the way until start of the match so don't stress if you have work or other plans and will be late, but not sure exactly the numbers we have so i might run out of accounts to hand out for the later peeps.As for who is flying on the day, **everyone** of all skill levels and aircraft types are welcome. As long as you can follow basic orders and fly as much as you can. If you don't, we will use BAM pilots who have infiltrated every outfit to locate you on Briggs and farm you (Illuminati confirmed). More people we get, the bigger the fights, and teams should be pretty balanced as well so it should be pretty epic.There should be a channel called pilot reserves on the server smash TS everyone hop on there before the match its where we will be deciding teams and handing out accounts. address:  ts.planetsidebattles.orgJust to clarify any basic questions that get asked, we are playing on Esamir as either VS or NC, and yes you made it into BAM.Match start is at Saturday 9pm AEDT (Sydney/Melbourne time).
2wlr05	-13244	1424476386	Briggs	Tonights Server Smash, BAM draft/roster.	We are going to hold a draft tonight to create the 2 BAM teams 90mins prior to the start. I cant give out your accounts until i know what team you are on (admin reasons). So the sooner you get on, the sooner you get picked and can cert your account how you wish.We can't put whole outfits together as it will create perhaps to much unbalance but i know people do want to play with friends. So for the draft, the captains Houdini and Popemunky will be choosing 2 pilots at a time. So if you have a preferred wingman or gunner let the captains know when they are picking you so they can choose you and your mate.And like i said on an earlier post, everyone wanting to fly is welcome, this includes Gals, Valks, ESF and Lib pilots/gunners. Come do what you do best but in a massive dogfight. Only limitations we have is the amount of accounts we have to use and we have heaps of those. 
2xo3zb	-13244	1425305961	Briggs	BAM recruitment for the next SS against Miller. (Saturday Night 21st of March)	Hey guys usual recruitment thread, put your names down to fly for BAM. Factions are yet to be decided, but the big news is its the first Server Smash to be held on [Indar](http://i.imgur.com/YkGgSlO.png). Pilot numbers have been getting lower, and that's just not for Briggs but Miller still manage to bring around a total of 7 squads of air in matches (way more than us). If you can fly, please sign up, honestly makes a huge difference when we have more pilots in BAM. Instead of struggling with getting anyone we can from the reserves list on the day.Game starts at 11pm AEDT (Sydney/Melbourne time) on Saturday Night 21st of March.

All trainings will be starting at 8pm AEDT (Sydney/Melbourne time).Thursday 12th of March.Saturday 14th of March.Wednesday 18th of March.Meet up on Briggs Teamspeak for trainings: ts3.planetside2.com.auWe should get Jaeger accounts again so we can practice without interference. Saturdays training i cant attend due to RL, So Neiche or another experienced pilot will take over for me. I'll let you know if you made it into BAM (In game, Reddit or through your outfit rep), and your role for the match as soon as stuff has been finalized. 
2zw7cw	-13244	1427021852	Briggs	Thankyou BAM, Congrats to Briggs and GG Miller.	It was an honor fighting next to all you pilots, i really enjoy these events as we put our shit aside and take the skills we throw at each other daily and throw it at someone else. We had some long ass dogfights, some hot flanks and even a WG camp, i hope you guys enjoyed it. Everyone else from Briggs, solid fighting, great teamwork, and it was fun as hell when we could actually co-ordinate airstrikes and use the intel we were throwing both ways.Finally GG Miller, the match at all stages had heavy fighting and nothing felt easy. To /u/SebABTF in the air, you were the most challenging air FC I've gone against. The shit you were throwing at us was unpredictable and had heavy intensity. I've versed big air balls in the past, but the consistent pressure thrown at us was very notable and a credit to your leadership style. In the streams they said we had air dominance, but from being at the helm of BAM it didn't feel that way at any stage.
30sa19	-13244	1427700419	Briggs	All welcome this Saturday - Multi Air Demolition Match (4/4/2015 8:30 AEDT)	I'm setting up a air team fight utilizing all aircraft so that way all peeps that do stuff in the air, so a gunner, a libber or a gal pilot can participate not just ESF pilots.There will be two teams, so it will be a 1v1 team fight. We will be doing this on Jaeger. I will decide the teams to keep them balanced but i will be reffing not leading, so if you feel like giving leading a shot yell out.This is **NOT** BAM practice, just an event for people of all skill levels and talents to have a fight in. But if you blatantly cant play well with others, or hamper whoever is leading your team then i will be kicking you from the event.Meet on the Briggs TS in the BAM channel: ts3.planetside2.com.au Try to be on 30mins prior to the start so you get an account and get put on a team if you come late then you might miss out or delay everyone else.[CLICK THIS FOR THE OFFICIAL RULES](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JxRI8Z2GF_FoT9MUQ0wBsLc3pGXrW2ZDyFmRWyJzvbk/edit)ATM i want to fight in the canyons of Indar, so one team will start at Broken Arch, the other at Feldspar Canyon.Ask questions or put down interest levels below, and as the title says all are welcome just remember its not a training so basic flight skills are expected. As a heads up it most likely will be TR verse NC on the day to avoid scythe pancake in canyons.Hopefully I'll see you at the MAD match Saturday Night.
31iy1g	-13244	1428247386	Briggs	MAD match last Saturday Night.	Cheers to the 32 guys who came Saturday Night, peeps seem to have a lot of fun so i would say it was a success. Credit to the dudes who captained each team (AlphaBeatle/Deadmau and Danoli). Was a great match, pretty happy it went to the 7th round, just a shame we had to restart the round due to a sundy spontaneously flipping. So we didn't clearly have a winner.Even though i was reffing i had a blast seeing what tactics you guys did, all the sneaky flanks and just generally seeing all the explosions.
320rh6	-13244	1428600842	Briggs	New flight sensitivity and what to do.	Its true the new flight mechanics are a little weird, they can be learnt again we all have to work with the same issues but it is doable. Best thing i have found you can do to make flying similar to how it was is make sure "*Mouse Acceleration*" is turned **OFF**. For some reason it turned on after this patch and seems to make aircraft feel like they are laced with lead and have random gravity applying forces on certain movements. For some it is ticked off, and they cant seem to be able to fix the controls. That said this isn't a pure fix, there is something still wrong with the system.This is just what i picked up on with other pilots right after the patch. There might be something else that can be done to fix it, if you cant fly at all, if it really is unbearable for you i recommend doing what Danoli put up on the PS2 Reddit. So we can do what 600 test pilots for DBG couldn't.https://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/320itm/esf_and_liberator_flight_control_changes_what_to/
32ju85	-13244	1429009680	Briggs	BAM sign ups! Emerald our next opponents.	3rd of May, Sunday 11am (AEST) we are versing an even more stacked Emerald than last time. They want to completely abuse all their manpower in a "fair fight" so we need to be prepared.To those of you pilots who i know can still fly, but wont because of the new changes. All i can say is i know its harder to fly now, and i don't expect you to love the flight changes or play hardcore on live. But this is a competitive scene, the win, our rep and our community is what we are playing for and its separate from DBG fuck ups. We can still A2G, we can still fly, our opponents will still be flying so you guys who pull out the rest of us will remember you as soft cock sons of cobalt. Especially when Emerald air show up as a full platoon as they did on the weekend against Connery.**SIGN UP BELOW!**

33hwyy	-13244	1429724231	Briggs	Air Demolition Match this Friday and Saturday Night at 8pm AEST. BAM pilots must attend.	All BAM pilots who are online on their computers when this is happening are asked to attend. The event needs you guys as things will run smoother and so we can take it to a larger scale, plus it will get you guys warmed up for the emerald match. That said I understand if you have OPs commitments with your outfits, which is why i put it on separate dates but i would like to see most of you over those 2 days.Like before all are welcome, /u/Cloudy87VS your guys helped the event heaps last time. /u/Pedrotski Bring your guys as well if you are interested and free. That said basics in flying maneuvers is expected to be known as this isn't training.To avoid drama on here private message me for information or with any questions, if you just want to say you are interested put a "o7" in the comments.Event goes for a total of 90mins because we need to set up before, but matches usually go for 60mins.We will meet on the Briggs TS:   ts3.planetside2.com.au
3405qo	-13244	1430116402	Briggs	BAM This week (Server Smash)	Trainings and briefings this Tuesday and Thursday at 8pm AEST. Meet on the Briggs TS.Most of you i have spoken to in game or at trainings and know if you have made it into BAM. Although its not finalized as im trying to bring the more committed guys.I do highly encourage everyone come to these trainings. If you think you are good enough and numbers are to few at trainings i wont hold them, others wont get form up, and we will struggle on the day. Which means no fun for anyone. That said if trainings are blatantly crap or held to often, recommend something.Remember this is our team our community so do what you can to help it out.Also we will have a final briefing later in the week when we get accounts. So ill hand them out and go over some final things. But i have no idea what day that will be so ill put it on reddit again.
34h0zf	-13244	1430445962	Briggs	BAM Final Briefing Saturday Night.	Meet on Briggs TS at 8pm AEST. Ill give out final info and also your accounts. If you cant make it at the time, message me and ill give you your account so you don't have to cert stuff last minute.Match is on Sunday morning May 3rd, 11am AEST, make sure you are online 1 hour before the start of the match. If you aren't on 45mins prior to the start i will sub you, its to hard re arranging rosters later than that.[Match times for other timezomes](http://i.imgur.com/lPqASDG.png)

35i1xt	-13244	1431274098	Briggs	BAM sign ups for the next SS match!	**31st of May, Sunday at 1pm AEST we are versing Connery.**Put your names down to sign up to fly on the day, but make sure you are good to make the match! Last match we had 10 pilots not show up, some had legit reasons and that happens every match, but many were no shows who still haven't given a reason. This is a competitive match, if you wish to take things casual and aren't sure you can make it (which is fine) come as a reserve because you will get subbed in most likely. Otherwise please don't put your name down we need to be as professional as we can be to compete against larger servers, and also finding pilots on a Sunday morning is a bitch.This doesn't apply to most of you guys who i can rely on really well now. But i needed to mention it, because not having an entire squad show up puts a huge dent in any tactics that were made.You guys who have ground commitments sometimes but are also pilots, please prioritize BAM for this match, im expecting us to be a little low on the pilot count. If we get a good turn out like last time ill do what i did last match and talk to your outfit leads and try to work out for you guys to get a spot with your outfit if its still what you prefer to do. So you don't miss out on game time because of BAM. I'll put info up later in the week about trainings.**TLDR Sign up for BAM, don't pussy out and be a no show on the day.**

As well credit to all the reps and leaders who put in so much effort in getting us prepared.GG guys!

Someone says (high risk high reward) that you can clear the enemy buff. So? :)

I am very slim. Legs are quite ok (i am a football player), but my arms and my chest are really slim. I never liked the upper part of my body but i never found motivation to start exercising.    Few days ago i played a football match (like I usually do) but after 1.5 hours of running, the only part of my body that was hurting were my arms. Recently my doctor told me (having had some issue with my back) that i can't put my back under too much pressure (he said that pressure is like doing exercise 3 days a week, using my back).    I would like to grow some muscles on the upper part of my body, but i lack 2 big things:   A little bit of motivation,    Some exercise that would make my arms grow without pressuring too much my back.   Thanks for any advice you will give to me.

I came upon this title yesterday by chance, its still in alpha.After watching some videos I decided to get it and haven't been this addicted in a game for a long time.Basically its minecraft 2D set in the future. Your task is to build up a mining facility, defenses and such. You have to worry about power management and distribution, conveyor belts, miners and smelters, stuff like that.I don't expect this to reach the front page, so I just thought I'd give the new page readers a heads up.On their page it says its only sold 9000 or so units; so I think this game has somehow gone under the radar of most gamers, it certainly went under my radar and I usually follow the indie gaming scene like a hawk.So let me end with a warning, its *really* addictive.---Quill18 has done a short let's try of it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8w6iVfBQBc---edit #1:URL to the game: http://www.factorio.com/

wpxu9	-13259	1342556943	AskReddit	What is your passion, reddit? Why do you love it?	Mine personally is mountain biking. It is hard to fully explain why I love it but  here are a few reasons in no particular order.The sheer variety of styles that it has, cross country, slope style, downhill, enduro, dirt jumping, and many more. Because of this there are so many different people that enjoy it and so many different bikes and things are ALWAYS changing. The adrenaline, this may be the biggest one. The sheer focus and excitement. It is such a rush to fly over everything, roots, rocks, branches, plants, and be just on the edge of control as you fly through nature. The idea that it is only you and your bike, all the people in the world can help you get there but in the end it is just you and that bike riding wherever you are. And because of that, I notice that some people, including myself, get into a focus mode where they tune everything out. I think this can be seen in [this screen](http://i.imgur.com/ZUR1I.jpg) from the mountain bike movie Seasons, which is a classic. That is Cam McCaul looking at the course ahead of him before a run in a competition, you can see how he is completely and utterly consumed by what he needs to do next.Oh yeah, and yeah get lots of scars, and everyone knows, chicks dig scars. I ride downhill, which is a style I mentioned above. For a little background if you didn't know, DH is where you are presented with a course and you try and ride down it as fast as you damn well can at great risk to your physical health. Here are a few examples:* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Ft33xwkA0* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bYjecH072E Here is me riding, I don't get anything from you watching, so don't accuse me of that. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjY4dUC_8f0I hope you guys will share yours, I may add more reasons as they come to me, but I'd love to hear stories of your sports.

[This was posted a week or so ago.](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1yzrzy/after_living_in_nyc_for_24_years_this_is_my_top/) Some guy is tired of the city and fantasies about moving somewhere secluded. Wrong bitch reddit is here to shit on this for no reason at all. &gt; That's a beautiful pic although it does present a false sense of serenity....because hiding in those woods are millions upon millions of relentless, blood-sucking mosquitoes, which will RUIN. YOUR. LIFE. no matter how much bug spray you bathe in.No exaggeration. &gt; I bet it'd drive you nuts to live out there just like it'd drive me nuts to live in NYC.As someone who doesn't know you here is the right answer. &gt; As a person who lives in a rural area, I'd rather deal with people than all those damn insects.I guess everyone really hates bugs.&gt; dat saturationI guess we will just shit on the picture now. &gt; All the way out there in the middle of nowhere, and five houses stacked right up on each other. And you want to get away from crowding?Could that be nitpicking a little bit? &gt;Never build on a debrisflow... cause thats what you got on the Picture. Steep Mountains, a narrow valley in the Back.. and a Lake in which the Debris Flow ends... there will be another..Don't you know every valley is inevitably flooded and destroyed, you are safe nowhere. &gt;Dude, if you're in the same NYC that I am...you're a few hours' drive away from tons of gorgeous mountains and rural towns. It'll warm up soon enough, then go nuts.Fuck you bro you are so stupid. &gt;and the first time you want a pizza a midnight you'll be pissed.What is life without pizza&gt;the grass is always greener....I am sure it is. &gt;I'd love to live here but getting groceries or anything would fucking blow.Yeah man everyone should just live in apartment complexes on top of a grocery store.&gt;Fuck living there at night time.I don't even know what to say anymore. &gt;Yah for about 6 months, then you'll want the city backWhy can't they just let him have this. &gt;I live in Western MA. I know a lot of people who are from NYC. They get bored really quickly. NYC has so much to offer for entertainment/food/hang outs etc. When you live in a rural area restaurants are very limited (pizza shop, chinese and a dinner) and entertainment is almost non existent other than the possibility of a movie theater or bowling alley/pool hall.tl;dr: Go to a rural area for vacation.This is so stupid. &gt;Your fantasy is gross oversaturation?Good god like no picture has ever been manipulated.&gt;Yeah, but where can I get a bagel?Back to the grocery store shit.  &gt;That's my fantasy too. For, like, a week. Then I'll want to be back near a city.Every single fucking comment. &gt;Probably gets lousy internet.INTERNET IS LIFEThere is no reason for hating on this. I skipped almost no comments as I scrolled down. Such a ridiculous thing to get all uppity about.

2p5t2r	-13259	1418461321	TrueFilm	Ambiguity in movie endings.	This thread will most likely contain spiders to The Game, 2001 A Space Odyssey, Shutter Island, and probably more. I've just finished Shutter Island for the second time and was thinking about the ending of it and why it left me feeling sort of underwhelmed. I'm probably going to spoil the ending so heads up. The ending of *Shutter Island* seems to me to leave you with a few interpretations. I think the main two are that you can believe that he was insane and they didn't break through. Or you can believe that he was actually sane and decided to die because he felt bad or whatever. But the important part is that you are interpreting how the movie ends and beyond that nothing else really. You aren't thinking about insanity on a larger scale except maybe a condemnation of how we treat the mentally insane, but that seems pretty basic. It seemed like all this exposition and this crazy story with all these parts came together finally to be those two choices. Which to me seems pretty lame. To compare that to another movie, *The Game* by David Fincher, which has an equal amount of craziness and cool story. *The Game* wraps up to reveal, after a huge amount of twists, that it is all really just a game in the end. I think going off what Scorsese did in *Shutter Island* there would be some "subtle" detail that the main character sees or hears that makes him and the viewer question again if it really was a game. But that doesn't happen. Instead you are left with something much more interesting, him deciding whether or not to get in the cab with the lady or go back to the party. With that ending you have to think about the character and how that changed him and how a human would take that whole experience. Which is a much broader and more interesting topic to think and discuss in my opinion, especially since there is no right answer. So in relation to broadness of subject matter I think think that *The Game* is much more broad than *Shutter Island* which makes it more interesting. But you can go even farther I think. And that distance is what separates good from great, from legendary which *2001: A Space Odyssey* is. I hesitate to use this movie as an example because it seems like low hanging fruit. To avoid that as much as possible I'll jsut say that obviously *2001* leaves the viewer questioning life and humanity and the galaxy and Ai and so much more with the ending. Which is so broad and amazing. All that being said people still prefer *Shutter Island* to *2001*. Why is that? Is it because it is easier to digest? Is *2001* too broad? I'm not sure. I hope someone can decipher a point out of this. This is my first post here and I hope it isn't too basic or often talked about. Thanks for reading. 
2pnt1h	-13259	1418884805	circlebroke	An unfortunate jerk in /r/hiphopheads	Usually /r/hiphopheads is a pretty solid place. If a post is really jerky or racist or just excessively stupid the moderators are good about deleting it. I guess this one slipped by. [This is the post.](http://np.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/2plmxd/nicki_minaj_says_kendrick_lamar_ripped_off_her/) The title is "Nicki Minaj says Kendrick Lamar ripped off her style". It has the flair of "Misleading Title" so that is good at least. That being said the anti-Nicki jerk seems to find its way into a usually Nicki friendly place.&gt;[ Nicki the type a chick to comment "FIRST!" on YouTube videos and shit.](https://np.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/2plmxd/nicki_minaj_says_kendrick_lamar_ripped_off_her/cmxt7zf)Okay what is even the point of saying that?&gt;[The weird voices K-Dot does are people's #1 gripe with him, but she's tryna say that's the reason he's successful?

2w975p	-13259	1424218904	MTB	Today the world famous Post Office Jumps were demolished in Aptos, California.	For those that don't know these are basically some perfect jumps that have been tuned over the last 13 years. They played a huge role in mountain bike films, and the careers of mountain bikers in the early 2000's until now. You probably can't watch a mid 2000's mountain bike movie without seeing these jumps in there or a reference to them. I definitely have fantasized about riding out there as well one day, I think watching[ this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aJzYioSDi4) was the first time I became aware of these jumps. Some pros have been lamenting this for a while.[Cam Zink](http://instagram.com/p/zJiuuEAntv/?modal=true)[Gregg Watts](http://instagram.com/p/zLeuE5gCa3/?modal=true)[Aaron Chase](http://instagram.com/p/zLSjb1qHSp/?modal=true)You can explore #RIPpostoffice on Instagram for some pretty heartfelt good byes to these jumps. Here is a [good write up](http://www.ksbw.com/news/central-california/santa-cruz/aptos-mountain-bike-jump-park-torn-down-tuesday/31318818) as well. A real bummer to see. 
2y9qf9	-13259	1425759332	MTB	I ride way more when I am surrounded by other people that ride.	This morning I woke up walked out of my room and saw my roommate had just purchased a carbon Devinci Dixon frame to replace the aluminum one he just broke. I cooked breakfast and ate it and was sitting there when my neighbor knocked on my door and asked if I wanted to shuttle some local trails. Naturally I said yes and I am waiting for him now. Tomorrow I am taking a ferry to an island to ride there for the entire day. For spring break I am riding Coast Gravity Park and then racing in the Double Down Hoe Down. Things are pretty rad here. I'm sorry if this comes off as bragging but I just wanted to share this with some people I know will appreciate it. Hope your pre season is going well also.

But anyways. So last night I got on gamefaqs which is the site I use primarily for trades on ACNL. And offered to trade Merengue for Marina. I got Merengue to move, let them come over and get her. Then she said "end, and i'll open my gates :3" so I ended, tt'd Merengue's house out and checked at the train station for towns. Her's isn't showing up. So I messaged her telling her that it  wasn't showing up. And she is playing it off like there's something wrong with my internet. But she came to my town fine and I even had a friend get on and check and his town showed up fine. So then I tell her that and she proceeds to get offline and not respond to my messages. I'm heartbroken. I wanted Marina for months and got my hopes up. Sigh. Never again, gamefaqs.

I remember listening to it on a Space Jam inspired playlist at fratmusic.com. I thought it was the playlist "Welcome To The Jam" but if it was, it's not there anymore. I've scoured the internet for it and I can't find it. I know for sure though that it was not just a standalone quad city dj vs whoever mix. Does anyone know of any possibilities that could be my missing mashup??

2b587g	-13270	1405791091	legaladvice	Going to upper management at former job about current director. [NC] With what I'm bringing, will I get into legal trouble?	So I used to work at this job for four years at my old college. About a month and a half before I left, a new director of our division took over. I was optimistic about her leadership when I left the job (due to graduation). Fast forward to present day, ~14 months after I quit, and 47 employees have quit the job with the primary reason being due to her (we only have around 25 employees on at a time). So I proposed to send an email to the head of the company. I'll carbon copy two leaders of other divisions who knew me well since they were both former heads of my division, and they knew my integrity. I'm doing it because I don't have anything to personally gain and I never had any issues with the new boss while I worked with her for a month and half. But also, this was the best job I ever had and it was more like a family. Furthermore, we didn't compromise on safety or job performance. I hate to see what it has become.So here are a few things I'm planning to make a point of (I'm only making points that have been substantiated by multiple people):* * -She specifically targeted veteran employees in disciplinary action and gave them less hours. I assume this was to bring in her own staff who wouldn't question her decisions.* * * * -She was incredibly against any feedback or criticism. Employees felt as if they could not go to her at all to discuss how things were ran. She snapped on people continuously when they would suggest a different way to try things. She does not like being questioned.* * * * -Multiple people have said that they received "verbal and emotional abuse." Many employees felt personally attacked and a lot of people have left her office crying.* * * * -She constantly reminded people that they were replaceable. She was passive aggressive in all instruction and her tone was condescending and unprofessional most of the time.* * * * -She knew that almost all her employees disliked her and she would go out of her way to remind everyone why they need her. I.e. without her, they couldn't have upgraded an arbitrary item. She was always on the look out for those that were "complaining about her to new employees, causing these new employees to dislike her." She was so self-absorbed, she couldn't believe that people could come to their own opinions of her leadership and management.* * * * -The pay was raised recently but prior to her, that wasn't needed because everyone loved their job. Now they have to compensate for her leadership with better pay.* * * * -Along the lines of extra costs, they definitely have to recruit a lot more to keep up with turnover.* * * * -She had a very unprofessional relationship (boyfriend-girlfriend) with an employee of another division. Everyone knew when they had a fight because of her attitude that day. He was also in her office a lot and our employees felt that if they were doing the same by not working and talking with their SO, she would snap on them.* * * * -I am going to cite multiple stories of where she completely went back on her word such as saying she would get someone's shift covered, then when the shift couldn't get covered, she punished that employee for not getting his/her shift covered.* * * * -She has two completely dishonest acts. One where she was the last in the building and the next day, a member of another division came in to find the door unlocked. This was reported to higher ups and they got mad at her. She blamed it on an employee who had left prior to her. Said employee got in trouble. The second one, she told an employee who quit that she was "legally obligated" to give her a letter of resignation. This isn't true. She only wants these letter of resignations so she can say that these people quit on their own (as long as she isn't mentioned).* * * * -She guilt trips all the employees for putting shifts on the tradeboard (because there are always so many up). Prior to her, there was nowhere near as many people looking to get shifts covered (people enjoyed their jobs). But she tries to make employees feel like their betraying each other other by asking for shifts off. They want shifts off because they don't want to work there anymore. When it was a happy workplace, this was never an issue, now it is after she took over.* * * * -She told an employee to his face that "not everyone has mommy and daddy paying for everything." She then insinuated this in an email to them that most of the employees' parents paid for their expenses, in regards to her perception that the employees were bitter about having to do extra work. The quote: "It's important to remember not everyone has parents/guardians/loans to support them and they would love to have a job whether it's picking up trash or sitting in an office."* * * * -This job is a campus job and the main reason to work at school is because most bosses understand the priorities of students. The job is not a demanding one and so on our downtime, we used to be able to study. Now she does not allow this and then blames employees of betrayal when they put shifts up on the tradeboard so they can study.* * * * -Very few felt as if she showed any of her employees respect. They were adamant that she was someone who couldn't earn respect but has to demand it. Furthermore, everyone at least agrees that she is not genuine when she tells them her concerns about them. When she does something that is "nice," there is definitely an ulterior motive.* * * * -A lot said that they never felt appreciated and she only ever had criticism.* * * * -She was a completely different person when upper management was around. She would immediately get nicer and more cheerful. I'll ask the director I'm emailing to take into consideration that she was very different when you were watching.* * * * -Many employees are adamant that they don't want their names mentioned in this email because they believe that the boss will go out of her way to personally hurt anyone who dissents. This comes mainly from her personality but she has also threatened multiple employees who were quitting that if they didn't stay, or finish their shifts, or said rude things about her, or whatever, she would be sure to punish them if a future employer called her.* * * * -Many qualified, outstanding employees said they would come back if she leaves the position.* * * * -To highlight the turnover issue further, we used to only have to hire once a year because people rarely quit, and when they did, it was because of graduation, or an internship, or something like that. Now they have to have recruiting sessions ~4 times a year and continuously hire new employees (new ones are brought in every month).* * * * -She took a staff of "responsible, skilled, seasoned, happy, fun, and positive [employees]... and turned them into grumpy, under appreciated, apathetic [employees]."* * * * -Most importantly, sans her leadership and management, we never failed at an emergency and we always fulfilled our responsibilities while still loving our job. What she brings is not necessary.Names will not be mentioned in the initial email. However, I will say something like, "there are a few employees who would be willing to speak with you personally, I can give you their contact information if you like." All of these things I am pointing out are coming from the stories/issues/concerns of those who told me that they quit the job because of her, not my personal feelings or issues. Of that 47 I mentioned, about 25 have contributed their input thus far.I plan on making this letter/email very professional and obviously expanding on all those points. So by sending this to the director of the company, with these claims, do I have anything to worry about legally?

You obviously don't remember anything from when you were in the womb (blackout drunk) and now everything is perfectly clear (stone-cold sober). But when you were five, everything was still very fuzzy (like being drunk).

I bought the power cord online. The laptop is a Compaq 6710b.I've disassembled it completely to look for any abnormalities on the board, and nothing stands out. I've tested the power switch to verify that hitting the button closes the circuit. I've also tested the power jack.There are 3 pins on the back of the jack plus its case. Case to outside pins is 19v, case to center pin is 6v, outside pins to center pin is 12v. Do these readings seem correct?There's no heat damage anywhere and the laptop seems like it was barely used judging from the lack of dust on the heatsink. I don't know where to go next. What should I look for or test? I really would like a working $3 laptop. I can post pictures of any part if you think it would help.

The ones within Windows work fine and I went ahead and activated the Window 7 virtual machine (I have access to MSDNAA through my school, so it's nothing for me to use my x86 cd-key for a virtual machine). When I boot into the Win7 VM from within Ubuntu, it shows up as not activated. The file structure is there though.Also, while setting up the other VM's within Ubuntu, I would occasionally get errors saying the disk wasn't available. What would cause this? What am I doing wrong?What about the Win7 VM? Why isn't the license showing up in Ubuntu when it shows up still in Win7? Should I reuse the same cd-key?

If I do that, what do I need to know beforehand?My second issue was with cooling the wort. It always took so long and I'd go through so much ice doing ice baths in the kitchen sink.

Paypal looks troublesome as it's a bank account with one owner. The sensei found something called WePay which sounds great, but the reviews are terrible. I mentioned doing a cash system, but still someone needs to hold the cash, we have to go to one person to buy things that are needed, and there's a manual cash collection process.Optimally, something where people can pay electronically and more than one person can manage the funds would be the best.How do you handle the dues or monthly fees for your small group or club?

You have either seen it and noticed it, or you have to do a little "research" on your own.I've always wondered this, and that's because I'm this way. The entire region of skin that marks my male genitals is darker than the darkest tan I've even managed to get anywhere else on my body. Looking at adult content online, you can see the same appearance on the female vulva, and there is a distinct line where the color fades into the natural skin tones. At the same time, there are people who have no distinct color difference between their genitals and their natural skin tone, tanned or pale.What causes this? I'm nearly certain it has to do with melanin production, but why would there be so much extra melanin there?edit: Here's a [pdf \[NSFW\]](http://www.aisia.org/txt/pdf/Creighton-normal-genitalia.pdf) of a study that attempts to quantify this, and other measurements, to determine "normal female genitalia". The relevant portion is on Table 1, as follows:*Color of genital area compared with surrounding skin (n): Same 9, Darker 41.*So it seems that normal is to have darker skin, but because of the idealized appearance, we've been lead to believe that same color skin is "normal". However, my question remains.

How would this compare to the coffee drippers that are are preferred here (like the hario)?Thanks for the help. Every day I spend here improves my morning cup(s) and I am forever thankful.
u1ddq	-13283	1337797766	Fantasy	Help finding a short story I read a year ago. It's about a guy who can hear grammar.	I read a short story a little over a year ago that was good, and I'd like to share it with friends. The trouble is, I don't remember where I found it or, for that matter, if it was a free text or audio short story. I thought it was one of the stories over at Tor, but I just read the description of all of them and none of the sound familiar. However, I've found some new short stories to read.It's a fantasy story that takes place in a world where everybody has some type of special power and centers around a guy who can hear grammar. In this short story, he is on a team of dragon hunters.

u8xlx	-13283	1338225560	Coffee	How and why does metal affect the flavor of coffee?	This is going to sound a bit strange, but please keep reading. I never paid attention until I got my new french press. The direction instructed me to stir the grounds with a spoon before pressing, and specified not using a metal spoon. I understand now that it is because of the glass wall and risk of breaking, but I didn't realize that then. This lead me to thinking.I made a french press one day and had to leave after my first cup. I put the rest in a stainless steel to go cup I have and left. The coffee in the cup tasted horrible compared to what I just drank minutes before from a porcelain cup.It stands to reason, though, that some metals would affect the flavor of coffee. There's a lot of food recipes that tell you not to use a metal bowl (on I can think of off hand is potato salad).So, the smart minds at r/coffee... what's going on here?**Edit: It may be too late for an edit, but I wanted to add an additional question. What type of to-go cup would you recommend? Stainless, glass, plastic, or ceramic?**

I understand how/why hot food is hot (chemical bonding to heat-sensitive receptors), but I couldn't find any information about how a localized reaction leads to a systemic response (especially when considering it's an environment-related reaction). To me, this is like my hands sweating if I walked barefoot across a hot asphalt road... which they don't.Thank you in advance for clarifying this for me.

yayz0	-13283	1345092416	bicycling	Beginning biking for fitness	I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this, but here goes...I would like to start biking for fitness reasons. I previously tried running and completed C25K to run my first 5K race, but then life got in my way and I didn't run for 6 months and lost it. Unfortunately, in that time I found out that some knee pain I had been having was a sign that I shouldn't run on roads anymore.So now I'd like to train for biking. The problem is that I don't see any standard training programs or schedules, so I have not idea how I'm doing or even what my goals are/should be.I have a yard sale bike, a Mongoose Hill Topper (chromealloy frame, no special pedals), but I have a smartphone for tracking and a chest strap/watch combo. However the little info I can find on my own talks about cadence, so that leads me to believe that I should be counting my pedal RPMs, but have no idea how I should be doing that.So I thoroughly confused and would really like some help on beginner training.Edit: I'm considering heading one way down a river-side road for half an hour, then heading back. After a while I'll be pushing that farther, and wanting to ride for longer. Is it that simple?

It might take me a while to respond though because I'm about to leave the house to hit a thrift store or two because I need a larger french press as the one I found only makes two cups at a time. I'd also like to find a drip kettle, but they're pretty rare. I had a dream that I found one at a thrift store though, so now I have my hopes up.

zghht	-13283	1346951603	Random_Acts_Of_Amazon	[Introduction][Discussion] Hello everyone. My name is CaffeinatedGuy and it's great to meet you all. Now tell me, what makes you a geek and why do you enjoy it?	After my fun-as-hell [discussion post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/zfl4p/discussion_i_want_to_guess_what_your_username/) from last night (237 comments? Wholly mammoth, that's a lot. Is that, like... a record?), I already feel like I know most of you.---So, this is me. My username is because I like coffee and always have. In high school, friends and I would hit Denny's and buy a cup each, and stay there for hours on end talking, writing, drinking coffee, and smoking (I know, right? In a restaurant!). I've since quit smoking (yay!!), but still enjoy a cup of the good stuff.Hobbies... Hmmmm... Currently I'm into [Iaido](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iaido), a Japanese martial art based around the samurai sword. The whole art is based around drawing the sword, typically as a cut, and replacing the sword after the kata. Yes, I wear the same pants they show in that article, called hakama.Previously, I got into homebrewing, but after moving to my new home, 3 years later and I still don't have my garage set up. I haven't made any beer, wine, or otherwise in that whole time.I'm an journeyman electrician and have a computer science degree, and kinda a geek. I like reading, but only fantasy, and listen to audio books when I'm not doing anything that involves thinking (like driving). I just picked up my first Arduino (the Uno, for other electronics geeks here) and want to learn how to program it.I like reading, and discovered Brandon Sanderson (my current favorite author) because he took over the Wheel of Time series when Robert Jordan passed away. I was concerned for the series, so I found a book by him (Mistborn), and became instantly hooked on his style.---###DiscussionI'm a geek because I like learning new things. I have to understand something fully to be able to enjoy it, so I'm always learning the basics of anything I get into. I don't have to say more, the above probably says as much.---Note: I will be leaving the house in an hour and  a half, so I will not be replying to anything for a few hours. I'll still reply to everyone as needed, as I did in that other thread. Oh, and post there if you want me to guess what your username means - that was a lot funner than I thought it would be!---Edit: How can I forget to mention it? I love board games!! My current favorites are Dominion and Cards Against Humanity. If you don't know what those are, you need to find out. The hardest thing about board gaming is getting people together with all our mixed schedules. I can talk about this for a long time, so I'll stop now and save it for another discussion thread.

115847	-13283	1349715151	WoT	I challenge you to re read each scene of a woman embracing saidar as if it were a sex scene.	Quick note, I'm on my 're read' with an audio book, so perhaps it's the lusty voice of the woman narrating, but the following passage reminded me how similar embracing saidar sounds to orgasming. I let my wife listen to the following passage after telling her that it sounded like a sex scene, and she turned redder with each sentence."She let the power fill her as completely as it ever had, more completely, accepting every drop she could hold. It was as if light suffused every particle of her, as if the light itself filled every cranny. Life seemed to burst inside of her like fireworks. She had never before let this much in. It was a shock to realize she was not quivering, surely she could not bear this glorious sweetness. She wanted to revel in it, to dance and sing, to simply lie back and let it roll through her, over her."Conclusion, Jordan could have written steamy sex scenes, but decided to give us this instead.

13og5a	-13283	1353698707	Random_Acts_Of_Amazon	[Discussion] I'm dealing with loser family members and need some advice and/or outside opinions	My mother-in-law, R, has quit her job to move from California to Oregon (where I live) for a new start. She's been living between hotel rooms and staying at whoever's house she can. Her husband, J, is a huge loser who's on and off with drugs (the hard kind, and apparently got R back into it) and went to jail 6 months ago for theft (broke into a car and stole a purse). He's currently on probation or parole, I don't really know the difference between the two.They finally got around to packing their stuff up to leave CA. This took them a while because no one they know was willing to help them out any more than they already have. They've burned *literally* every bridge they had. Not even R's 4 other adult children will help any more. They got J's mom to agree to use her van to tow the trailer with their stuff up here, but then broke down (overheated **AND** ran out of gas) only 1.5 hours into their 6 hour trip.Oh, and they have a son, age 3, who has a fever.(Sorry if I'm skipping around a lot, but there's a lot involved here)So, they're stranded with no money for gas (this is Wednesday). No money for gas? Who leaves on a 400 mile trip, no... an 800 mile round trip... with no money for gas? I guess J's plan was to siphon gas the whole way. No idea how he was going to get his mom home. So he's siphoning gas and accidentally put some diesel in their tank. They spend Wednesday night in the van in the small town they broke down in.Thursday (Thanksgiving), we (my smart family up here) put our heads together and decide that if he siphons out all the gas in the tank and fills it with unleaded, he will be fine and only needs gas money. We discuss for a while how to get money to people with no bank account, no paypal, nothing. Western Union and it's huge fees is the only option. In this time, they get the car gassed up and started, only to realize that in overheating, they blew the head gasket.So, now these idiots are stranded still, no one willing to help them. They have had multiple people offer to give just her and the kid a ride to Oregon, and all she has to do is leave J behind to deal with his own shit. I've told her the same thing, but she's unwilling because "How will I be able to sleep if I don't know if he's okay or how he's going to be able to visit?!?" Boo hoo. Let the man get a job for once in his life, or hitch hike if he really wants to come up here.Nope. Unwilling to negotiate. Meanwhile, the baby still has a fever and they have spent two nights in the van.What would you do in this situation? What are your thoughts on the matter? My wife is willing to go with whatever I propose, from bringing R, J, and the kid up here to just abandoning them and ignoring her calls. Help?
13tu0m	-13283	1353959870	techsupport	My network adapter occasionally stops working correctly, especially when waking from sleep.	The network icon in my tray will have either a yellow triangle or a blue circle on it when waking. With the blue circle, the connection is never made without any assistance from me. I've been using the only workaround I know of, the "troubleshoot problems" option.When this is running, it resets the network adapter and I am able to connect to my router. At the completion of troubleshooting, the problems found is "Local area connection" doesn't have a valid IP configuration - not fixed.My ethernet adapter is on my motherboard, model GA-MA785GM-US2H rev 1.1 (or maybe 1.3, I can look if it really matters).How can I fix this?Edit: I forgot to mention that I have previously updated the Realtek LAN Driver to the latest version from the downloads available at Gigabyte's website, and this hasn't fixed the problem. They have also added a Realtek Ethernet Diagnostic Utility as of August this year, and I have installed it but have no idea how to use it.---Edit: I should have made it more clear that waking is not the only time this happens. Sometimes (like just a couple minutes ago) this will happens while I'm on the computer. The Blue-ring-of-connecting will show up and never go away until the troubleshooter resets the adapter.

1463yw	-13283	1354487231	Portland	What is the general attitude in Portland (cops and otherwise) towards sleeping in your car?	I'm coming up from Southern Oregon for work and will be in the area on and off for a few weeks. The cheapest hotel near where I'll be in Tigard is around $50. Considering the huge chunk of change I had to charge for a brake overhaul, and the fact that I haven't worked in a month, I'm a little light on cash. I've decided to sleep in my minivan. I can shower at the Y and the Mon ill save will go to out of town food and presents for my kids. However, I'm worried that someone will kick me out of the lot or a cop might hassle me when I'm trying to rest. What can I expect?
1501cu	-13283	1355764330	books	I have some losers in my life. These people don't try very hard to succeed or move forward, don't think before they do something stupid, and are generally a drain on society. I'd like to buy them each a book for Christmas. Can you help me pick out the perfect books for them?	As the title said, I have some people in my life that are going nowhere, and I'd like to improve that. I think you can learn a lot from reading, fiction or nonfiction, and I'd like to help them.* The first person is my half sister. She's 22 and on her third kid with her second guy who she cheated on her boyfriend (and babies' daddy) with. She also quit her already low paying job through the no-call no-show method because she was too busy partying.* The second person is my mother-in-law. She's lived in various hotels and on various couches for the last seven or so years. She manages to hold down jobs when she has them though, but only at the lowest level. She had to move to another state because she has no other family and friends that are willing to help out her, her 2 year old son, and her husband (who I'll cover in a minute) and currently resides at my house (oh joy!).* Lastly is my step-father-in-law, a guy that is a year older than me and married to my mother-in-law, and father of my 2-year-old brother in law. He's a double felon and believes that the world is out to get him. He won't even try to get a job without me forcing him to comply as part of the rules of the house.So, what books can help these people reanalyze their priorities and create new reachable goals in life?

Things I know top that list, and sadly, like most of you, that means talking about work. Some of us do this job because it's the only thing we know well, others because we find a genuine interest in either electricity or the things it can do. We work hard and have our good days and bad days. Likely, you want to complain about your work as much as you want to brag. Maybe you're laid off and want to complain about it, or you got a side job and want to talk about ducking the law to do a service change with not permit (there's a story there...). Do you have a code question? Code change complaints? Want to compare codes from different countries? Discuss the ups and downs of grounded systems? My point is, there are a hundred things you want to post about that will get responses, and the more active a subreddit, the more subscribers we can drawn in. If you want a great community, you need to make it happen. Please, no everyone who reads this, create one post before the week is over. Post a picture of your weekly accomplishment, a question for others, some relevant news, or some scary find. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Is the only way to learn a weave to see it? Is this a limitation or just something not talked about in the book? Speculation: books were destroyed during the breaking and none were recovered. In the years following the breaking, weaves were only taught by others as a way to avoid knowledge becoming lost again. No one in the Third Age has considered writing a book on weaving as they have traditionally learned from others for the past 2000 years. Thoughts?

17gjdp	-13283	1359415300	amazon	Amazon search frustration - Why can't I exclude items from my search? [rant]	It's really annoying and frustrating to search for items on Amazon. When I'm fine-tuning my results and I continuously end up with items that don't match my query, there should be a way to exclude these items.I don't know if Amazon is trying to talk me into buying something that I don't want, but it's not going to work. If I'm using the search box it's because I'm looking for something specific. When I start selecting categories, it's because the search results are shit and I'm finding what I'm looking for. Still, though, unrelated items continue to clog my search results.Even more irritating is when I'm searching for items and I put a portion of the query in quotes. In most search engines (like google) this means "return only the results that match this exactly. Not so with Amazon. I'm trying to find accessories for my tablet and search for:     "galaxy tab 2" usbWhy, then, are most of the results for items for the galaxy tab? The two models and types of ports are not compatible, that is why I am searching for a specific version of this tablet.Even worse is when searching for a specific type of adapter for my phone. Searching:   galaxy s3 hdmi... yielded several types of adapters that have nothing to do with HDMI, and even more for older versions of that series (the MHL version changed between the s2 and s3, so the older ones are not compatible).There were several other similar searches that pissed me off, but I can't recall them as there have been too many and this is a nearly everyday occurrence.I would like to see a way to X out a particular item from the results list, and possibly a context menu popup asking why I want that item removed from my query. Then, if enough people keep removing that items from a particular query, they remove it entirely.I notice that *sometimes* sorting by relevance over sorting by best selling or top rated give more, well, relevant results. However, if I'm looking for the top rated item in a category I have to weed through a lot of crap to find it.Take [this example](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_n_0?rh=n%3A3760901%2Ck%3Amens+supplement%2Cn%3A%213760931%2Cn%3A3764441%2Cn%3A3773091&amp;bbn=3764441&amp;sort=reviewrank_authority&amp;keywords=mens+supplement&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359413979&amp;rnid=3764441). I'm blindly looking for a "men's supplement" in the "vitamins and supplements" category. I've sorted by review. What are the top results? Hand cream, shave balm, therapeutic socks. None of those are a vitamin, supplement, or for men (well, I guess the shave balm, but still, it's miscategoriezed).Even [broadening the search](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_hi_3?rh=n%3A3760901%2Cn%3A%213760931%2Cn%3A3764441%2Cn%3A3773091&amp;bbn=3773091&amp;sort=reviewrank_authority&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359414033) to anything within the *vitamin and supplement* category and sorting by review brings up things like coconut oil and biofreeze. Neither are supplements or vitamins.Amazon either needs to fix their product tags and categories, or they need to allow users to be able to remove items (often times, an entire page of items) from their search query./rant

I've only dropped 10 pounds, but I look thinner and went from a 35 pair of jeans to a 32.So, what am I gonna do with my almost new Carhartt's?

Waterproof toppers aren't stretchy and create a sort of "drum effect" where that layer prevents you from sinking properly. So, what am I supposed to use? I can't find anything on Amazon, and whole googling leads to lots of forum discussions, I can't find an actual answer on a product.

1uz0b5	-13283	1389464289	everymanshouldknow	EMSKR How to properly wear a tool belt	Believe it or not, I'm a tradesman, electrician for 9 years. Fairly recently, after coming off unemployment, working a commercial job, and losing weight, I realized that I have no idea how what the correct way to wear a tool belt is. It feels most comfortable to wear it above my hip bones, but it looks like I'm wearing my belt really, really high (good belts are fairly wide) and the top of the belt is against the bottom of my ribs. You always see pictures of guys wearing their belts really low, like with their butt holding it on their hips. This puts a lot of strain on the lower back, but it's the standard "image" of a tradesman. Plus, us skinnier guys don't have much butt to stop the belt from sliding down. I've googled this problem, but can't seem to find an official answer from any of the tool belt companies (seriously, this should be in the company faq) or studies on the matter. So, EMSK, what is the correct way to wear a tool belt?

She lost 50 pounds pretty quickly and I lost 30, putting us both safely in the healthy range. However, we've both keto adapted and just don't feel like counting total calories for that last little push. Keto has been great to us and we'll definitely be back from time to time, possibly intermittently to take advantage of those first few weeks of fat loss. So now we're looking at paleo and primal as possible diet alternatives. Paleo is anti dairy (no cheese!), which I'd really miss after my time on keto. Both, I believe, allow beer, which I really miss. Primal allows legumes in limited quantities. I guess the reason for this post is looking for advice on changing my diet, hopefully from someone who has done it before. How was the change? What did you change to? How did it work? Do you go low carb periodically? Do you have any advice?

2blsx9	-13283	1406218425	offmychest	Fuck, I just got a raise	Right before the end of my shift, I was approached by my department supervisor and informed that there was a meeting at ten to seven. It's not unusual to have a meeting at this time of the morning, however it was strange for the boss to ask around instead of just posting a notice to attend a meeting. This has to be bad.I didn't care though, whatever beratement we were about to endure, drug testing based on accusation we had to take, or scolding we would receive, I had a secret. I was planning on quitting my job in a couple days. I was leaving the trade. My career as a tradesman, journeyman electrician to be precise, was about to forego a massive change in just over two weeks. I had been accepted into a position in an office, in a hospital, working directly with tomorrow's technology."Are you on your way?" The voice came over the walkie talkie. "Yeah, almost there." I lied, finishing up my piss. If they were going to drug test me, they were going to have to pay me overtime while I refill my bladder.As I get to the designated meeting spot, different from the customary break room we typically meet in as a shift, and I see my department, maintenance, supervisor; the big boss; and my coworkers from maintenance.The meeting begins with the big boss, the plant supervisor, mill manager, big cheese, or whatever the fuck his actual job title is starting into the lecture about production, job markets, etc. I was hardly listening, until he mentioned the raise.The job I planned on taking was going to pay about 2 dollars less than I was currently making, and would increase my commute time from 5 minutes to 35 minutes, but I could live with that. It was hard taking those losses, but I could do it because that job has a lot of potential. Working with health information technology has a lot more future than mill electrical, it was something that I could grow in. I would also, finally, be a white collar worker. Maybe people would respect me more, with my slacks and tie instead of my coveralls and grease.Two dollars an hour more for electricians, and a dollar and a half more per hour for millwrights. I'm an electrician, in case I hadn't mentioned that. I'm kinda drinking right now to numb myself from the news. I'd make two dollars more per hour than I had been, increasing the pay difference from this job to my new job by, well, four dollars.Fuck. Has there ever been a worse time for a raise.This story went downhill pretty fast and I apologise. The only whiskey I had to "celebrate" with was 100 proof, and then my wife woke up halfway through typing this up, and I had to give her the "bad" news. Seriously, you've never seen someone so visibly torn than when I gave her the bad news about my raise.LOL, fuck.Anyway, I'm more than likely going to take the job at the hospital, as it is something I can actually progress in and will probably enjoy. I'm going to make $4 less per hour now, instead of two. Fuck, that sounds bad. I'll have more paid time off, though, so there's that...

I have an audiobook player. I use it a lot. It's on my home screen. I have Unicon, a non launcher icon themer. When I install an icon pack, I still have the audiobook app's default icon, and it doesn't match the theme. As we all know, LG let's you set new icons, but the selection is limited. You can make a new one, but only by cropping photos. It doesn't detect the icon packs and let me pick a suitable icon from that. How can I make this work?

Each package has a move ID that follows a set naming convention (IPDCG001 and on up, designating the team I'm on and my initials).I've got a nice build tracker going, but since we have two main sites that we manage, I have two sheets to keep the build separate. I'm also supposed to maintain the same numbering convention; I have to switch between worksheets to find the last number I used.Is there a way I could automate this a little?I'd like to have an Info sheet with a hidden row where I can do a n=n+1 to increment my build number each time it's used, and then maybe create a formula that I can copy/paste into the next package ID cell... but then the number will need to stay set afterwards.How would you accomplish this?

I work at a park where the public can come and look for dinosaur fossils and park of my job is talking to people who have questions.  So yesterday, I was sitting at my table logging visitor finds when an older woman sits down near me and asks me if I know who the oldest human was.  Confused and not sure where she was going with this, I said that I didn't.  She then said, "Well according to the bible, it's Methuselah."  She then went on to tell me that the dinosaurs were killed in the flood, that the bible should be trusted over people and that if you never sin you will live forever.  She went on about it for about 10 minutes until her group gathered to leave.  The entire time I was stuck smiling and nodding afraid of what might come out of my mouth if I had allowed myself to speak.  This is the first time anything like this has ever happened to me and I had no idea what to do or say.  Just needed to vent.

I like my progress so far it's just that I ran into a problem that overlooked; never even knew it would be a problem. I have two case fans and only one fan header on my motherboard. I was told that getting a y-splitter would resolve the issue, so I went out and got one. However, I read up a bit more after I bought it (in hindsight, I should have done that initially) and learned that I could end burning my header because it will need to supply more voltage. I'm a bit worried now, but I want to know if I'm safe going through with splitting them. I have an Msi 760gm-p23 motherboard and 2 12v corsair case fans. If it turns out it isn't recommended to split the header, I'll just look into other solutions. I'd really appreciate your help!

q6j6g	-13315	1330245116	AskReddit	Girlfriend's scumbag ex	Since they have broken up, her ex has been stalking her on fb and also calling at random times of the day. She has let me have access to her fb and I have told him to piss off as well as been blocking all of his accounts that he has on fb. What do you think are the next moves I should take?update: ok just got done talking with the cops and they told me that the more I send messages to him, the more the say it will be mutual and to have her send a message saying to leave her alone or she is going to press charges. last message he sent said "no it's not a sad world I made its sad that your still alive". Thankfully she is staying with her parents and that house has an alarm system and is also a pro-gun householdupdate part 2: after last message I said "that sounds like a threat" into which he replies that it is not and that he is happy for us that we are together but if I "hart" her in anyway, there will be something done about it.last message I sent to him was 'Contact either her or myself and we will press charges. Neither one of us want to talk to you anymore'. so far, I got up to four different accounts on fb that are his.note: this guy's grammar is absolutely horrible, it would make any grammar nazi rip their own skin off. I have to re-read all the messages slowly just to make sure I understand them due to the missing words, misspelled words, same phrases typed in duplicates, etc. I keep asking why she went out with this dipshit and she just said he was nice during the first few months
v5ztq	-13315	1339905461	AskReddit	Oddest insult that you used (or heard) that actually worked	I worked at a convenience store on the graveyard shift, which meant I worked by myself most of the time. Once in a while I had to work with other co-workers, now there was only a few of them I gotten along with but the rest I hated. One night I had to work with the manager's daughter (let’s call her rina), she has one of those voices that is just absolutely horrible and she is singing. I ask nicely multiple times to stop singing and she just goes "pffft" and continues singing some song. After multiple attempts of resolving this nicely, it comes down to this:Me: "Will you stop fucking singing!?!" Rina: "Why? I have a beautiful singing voice." Me: "No you don't, your voice reminds me of two bulldogs that have Tourettes and long nails having sex on a chalkboard."The rest of the time up there with her was absolute silence except when having to talk to customers.

My mom is a high school teacher and during my senior year, she had called a bunch of businesses for donations, gifts, coupons, etc. for our project graduation. This one restaurant that we went to all the time told her that they would be more than happy to give a donation toward our project graduation. She goes up there and tells one of the waiters that she is there for the donation, the waiter tells her to hold on a min while she gets the manager. While my mom is waiting, she sees a guy holding a newspaper up like he is reading it walk past her at a fast pace. The waiter that she talked to originally comes back out and seats a couple, when he come back, my mom ask when is the manager coming to talk to her. The waiter has a puzzled look on his face and says "You didn't see him, I know he came this way", the waiter then begins to describe what the manager looks like and my mom realized that the manager was the guy with newspaper. She comes back home just absolutely pissed about what happened and she told me that she would never go back to that restaurant again. Have you or anyone you know done something like this before? note: For those who don't know what project graduation is, it is a graduation party that is thrown by the school and parents so that they make sure no one is drinking and driving after the graduation

1a0qjs	-13317	1362915458	runescape	People disliked the Eoc community. Me? I think it's better	I played 07 back in 07, the game has moved on and I moved on with it. I was never part of the pking community but when the majority of them left with the release of the EOC I noticed that people were much nicer, there was far less flaming. When 07 came back and lots of them came back to play it the fc's were flooded with these guys and the "old community". And for all the nostalgia, I don't like that, it pisses me off when all I see is "you faggot" "kid" "you mad bro" It's constantly the same thing and it's tiring.As a result i'v had to leave Runesharks fc which I have been in for months and join Castle Wars because it's got mainly Runescape players in it and frankly; that community is nicer. Finally, I don't hate on you for playing 07 - it's a really good game, I don't play it now but obviously enjoyed it or I wouldn't have stuck with it when I first started - so please don't hate on me for playing the game I enjoy.

I was intending to go to SA next but simply have to return to India, there's no choice involved really! I want to stay for at least 6 months in India alone but would rather stay longer than that and have a couple in Nepal. I know Visas for Nepal are very easy as I entered by land last time but it possible to get a year long Indian visa with double entry?

Hi I'm looking into routes for becoming a pilot and although I certainly would enjoy working as an airline pilot I think professionally flying light aircraft seems to be a more versatile career option for me.After doing an integrated course at Oxford Aviation Academy for example do you have the option to fly light aircraft or just airliners? If not what would be the best route for training and employment for smaller aircraft. I've done a fair amount of reading and will be going for an open day but can't work out the best option for a career that isn't pegged down to flying airliners.Any help and advice would be appreciated, thanks

33t943	-13317	1429963339	seduction	My living situation creates a mental block.	I'm a fairly sociable person, I don't struggle to make conversation but I have always had a block with approaching girls, which isnt helped by the fact that my social group are stoners. After coming to some conclusions myself and also reading this sub I realize that the best thing for me would be to just go up to someone and say "hi".But worrying about my situation holds me back, I'm 21 and live with in a small house with my parents while all my friends are away at University and although I've had a girlfriend I've never had a girl come round, which makes me feel pretty uncomfortable about it. For some reason that becomes the excuse for why not to approach someone. It seems stupid writing it down but when something is real in your own mind its hard to shake, I just always think "okay well whats going to happen after this because I'm not going to take them back to mine" and therefore don't approach at all.Has anyone got any anecdotes of how they got past their mental block? I know the answer is to just do it but that easier said than done in the moment.

When I reached the one open line there was a guy there who had just started checking out. He had two full grocery carts. He was polite and apologetic about his gigantic purchase. I said it was no problem, if I was in some big hurry I wouldn't be out at 4:30 am. I noticed a few things off about him. He was filthy, the kind of sun-blasted, sand and sweat grime you don't see anywhere but the desert southwest. His shoes were both untied. He couldn't keep his pants up. And all his other possessions were in a backpack, which he had down by his feet.After another few minutes (seriously, he had hundreds of items), he went down into his backpack and came up saying, "Oh no! I don't have my debit card." The cashier said, "Oh, that's quite alright." There wasn't a lot of talk exchanged. We all knew that something was afoot. No one was surprised that this guy didn't have any money. The cashier finished ringing up the last twenty or so items. He took his backpack and left. I would expect some words like, "I'll be right back, my wallet's in my car." There was nothing like this. Just a strange resignation that something very odd was going on.I asked what it was about. They had no idea. I asked if it happened often. The cashier said it did, about once a month (though not with this guys specifically). Then she announced that the receipt totaled more than $1200. The security officer came over and mentioned that the guy had been in the store for about five hours.Does anyone know what was going on? Was he using the huge grocery order as cover some stolen items in the backpack? Was he behaving suspiciously as cover for other homeless people who were coming in to shoplift? Was he delusional? Was he an eccentric millionaire? Has anyone who has worked in a grocery store ever seen such behavior?
1n4x0e	-13328	1380148326	AskReddit	Are you making plans for being homeless?	I've spent my entire life on or near the margins of homelessness without ever losing a place to sleep. But I worry that I could be homeless on a moment's notice. Everything about my life is marginal. So, I ask, do you spend time planning your life as a future homeless person?For instance, do you think about places you'd try to sleep, ways you'd try to get food or ways you might make a shelter and camouflage it? Where you'd hide your stuff? How you'd try to beg for money, and so on?
1n8v1e	-13328	1380287936	self	Coffee Makers and DIY Meth Home Labs	I like to follow a lot of photographers on flickr who post scans of old advertisements. Past dreams of the future are good landmarks for where we are as a society, and where we are as individuals. I feel I can evoke the past by sort of reliving what I was hoping for. And as an adult, looking back on the past, I can sort of feel like an adult in my memories of the past. I can get a sense of what it likely felt like to be an adult in the past.I was looking at scans of old ads for coffee makers and beer. As a society, we've really put massive effort into turning these drugs into cheap, readily available fixes for life's problems. There's an ideal person we are supposed to be, and we all fall short. We can't get to sleep when we should, and can't wake up when we should. We can't forget our problems when we're supposed to be jovial. We can't be serious at the right time. We're all failures, really. But these drugs can help us to muddle along and at least pass.I got to thinking what would the machines look like if they were meant for drugs that don't have the societal stamp of approval? What would a DIY home meth lab look like? What kind of machinery would arise to help heroin addicts if it were legal? What kind of ads would Bayer run for cocaine? What would our society look like if we put the might of industry and science behind currently illegal drugs?I am always amused by weed smokers and dealers who think that if marijuana were legalized that they would suddenly become captains of industry. If marijuana were legalized Dow Chemical and ADM would partner up and put you chumps out of business in a week! And by the same logic, if other illegal drugs were legal, users wouldn't be cooking them in filthy spoons and smoking them in glass pipes. Industry would develop safer and more effective means to get the drugs to the blood or brain. And it would all be more stylish and elegant. Just think of all the effort that goes into making stylish, elegant and efficient coffee makers. It's practically the same if you grind up some beans, throw them in a pot of water and then strain it through an old bandana. But that's not how we do it.

Time to pop on my jeans, my long sleeve grey top, a black hat and dark shoes and head out into the middle of the street to go for a jaunt.What is with the Tucson Pedestrian Death Wish?I understand that the lack of lighting and sidewalks make for problems. But I *regularly...* as in *daily* see people jogging down the white bicycle lane line in the street on streets with a perfectly smooth, flat sidewalk. And by "see" I mean, see them at the very last second. Sometimes people blend in remarkably well. Judging by the number of people I see driving over the speed limit while 100% immersed in reading texts on their cellphones, this seems like unwise behavior. I know that people do this (run or stroll in the street) because they just aren't thinking about it. But it seems sometimes that they must be thinking, "Go ahead, hit me! I'll be dead and my family will sue you and WIN! Then who's the idiot!?"

zfojm	-13332	1346907349	insanityworkout	Didn't finish fitness test last night. Should I do it again tonight?	Fairly active, played basketball in highschool and play basketball often. However, I haven't done any hard workouts in two months because of sickness and traveling Asia. I did the fitness test last night, and nearly passed out. I only could finish 5 exercises. I may have gone way too hard  during the first 3 exercises. My question is if I should do the fitness test again pacing myself so I can last throughout... or just continue on with Insanity and the next fit test remember that I could only get through 5 exercises?

After relative inactivity for about two months and ballooning from 150-180 during college, (the latter 20 pounds in the two years) I decided to do Insanity in order to lose some weight and be healthy! I'm 5'11 and currently 180. I stayed about 180 since starting Insanity, but my conditioning is much better than two weeks ago.  Here are my results! 1. Switch Kicks -50 -55  2. Power Jacks - 41- 42 3. Power Knees - 67 - 884. Power Jump - 33 - 335. Globe Jumps - 8 - 106. Suicide Jumps - 13 -177. Push up Jacks - 5 -208. Low plank oblique - 25 - 43I'm disappointed with the little improvement in the first 4 exercises, but the last 4 I had so much more energy than the first fit exercise. I'm a little disappointed on not losing weight, but I heard that's muscle filling in for the fat. Lets hope so!

Ron never responded LOL my guess is he is too busy with preseason. However, his manager did respond to me. She actually said she and ron are aware of reddit AMA after Obama did his. It's just that they never decided to do it for one reason or another. She then told me, that Ron often does a live ustream and answers questions from twitter, so technically it should be like a video AMA, except on twitter instead of Reddit. I told her that Ron was very wanted on the reddit community, she would bring it up to him again. And that's all I have folks. Now, proceed to downvote me into oblivion! OP does not deliver!! 3 years ago, he tweeted if there was anything to do in San Diego. I was attending UCSD at the time, and coincidentally UCSD was hosting an all campus dance at the time. I tweeted him to come to UCSD. I jokingly said "your not down" and gave him my number thinking he would never respond. Apparently he had direct messaged me "what time should I come" about three times on twitter, but I didnt check twitter. He then called me on the phone while I was eating at a cafeteria. Anyways, to save you guys from reading alot, he essentially came to my school and performed and let me go on stage with him. Needless to say, I became very popular. His manager thanked me through text for allowing Ron this opportunity. I kept in contact with him and his manager through text, and he has provided me with Laker tickets twice (btw I hate the Lakers, Rockets fan here). I sometimes text him and his manager and they have responded most of the time. He updates me with his new # each time (he goes through like several different numbers a year, because he is constantly doing giveaways). I just discovered reddit about 3 months ago, and barely realized this connection. I can possibly text him and his manager to do an AMA, if interest is there? I can't promise anything, as this is training camp and the start of the season, and he is VERY serious about training. But it's worth a shot if interest is there.[Proof](https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc6/8533_1261443375377_2329273_n.jpg) and [More Proof](http://i.imgur.com/4r7Wg.jpg) Edit: I sound like I'm showing off with the long story lol, I'm just wondering if anyone would even care for there to be a AMA for Metta World Peace. Edit 2: Ok guys, I just texted his manager and him so I'll let you know if they respond. To all the people bashing me for being an attention whore.... I agree, this was a very attention whoreish post and I'm sorry lol. I also did think it would be a story people would want to hear and enjoy. With that being said, I wasn't doing this for karma (self posts dont get karma) or trying to impress people I don't even know. I really did want to get a general feel for Ron's (Yes I call him Ron, and so does his manager) popularity. I wasn't sure if people absolutely hated him, thought he was a douche, wanted to cuss him out, etc.... I didn't want it to be a disaster for him and waste his and his manager's time. It seems most people love Metta. Anyways, I'll update when there are updates.

I skipped two core cardio and balance days, due to some partying lol. THEN without really thinking about it, did the fit test right before max interval circuit. I was dead tired after the fit test. I couldn't even get through the warm up on max interval circuit, so I decided to hold it off until either my max recovery day, or Sunday - my off day. Anyways, I improved very little. A little dissapointed, but that could be because I missed half of the recovery week partying lol.1. switch kicks - 50 - 55 - 60 2. power jacks - 41 - 42 - 463. power knees - 67 - 88 - 894.

Basically, I'm asking is the  80 dollar difference worth it? My dad is 70 and is going to use it mostly for browsing, pictures, and just random stuff. If this was mine, I would most definitely go for the Ipad 4becaue I always want the newest stuff haha. But my dad is 70. Will he notice the difference? I'll also be using the Ipad 4 from time to time, since I live with him. Thanks!

She called me on Friday, and my test is on Monday. She said it was going to be about an hour long, and it is going to be like the GMAT. This weekend though I was trying to study for the GMAT, and realized there was no way possible I can study all the topics. I'm kinda freaking out. If I try to learn every subject, I may not know enough about each one. If I focus on some subjects, I may not have studied the right subjects at all and with my luck the test will be on completely different subjects. What should I do? Has anyone had these kind of prescreen math tests before? How was it? Should I just relax and go over some practices tests to get my brain moving (It's been 8 months since I graduated). It's going to be impossible to try to master every subject on the GMAT math in two days (1 day already being gone).

I've been out of work for a year since graduating (I have a part time job totally unrelated to field just for the cash). I've had like 6 interviews but I haven't gotten any offers. Hypothetically, if I were to be offered a part time job in my field, would it be worth it to take it. As of right now, they do not have any plans to turn this part time job into a full time offer so I'm going to assume it will stay a part time job forever. Is it worth it to take an offer and give up on finding a full time job? I know the part time job will help me with experience (something that has clearly hurt me in interviews), but I really want a full time job. Money isnt a major issue. How bad would it look if in my resume, say, I work at this P/T job for 3-6 months and leave after finding a full time job. That is what concerns me the most. I don't want to be stuck in a part time job for over a year.

Been looking for around 8 months now. Nothing initially but I've had about 8 interviews in the past 3 weeks all of a sudden. I finally got a job offer, for a full time Accounts Payable clerk with benefits after 90 days.... but the pay is $11/hour. Don't get me wrong, I am grateful for this offer. But 11 an hour feels like a slap in the face which is about 22,000 a year. I currently work as a cashier/janitoral clerk for 10 dollars an hour part time to help pay the bills. However, I feel like being unemployed in terms of jobs in my career field I essentially HAVE to take this job. With no accounting experience or any experience besides part time work I would be dumb to say no. Reddit, whats your advice? She wants to know by tomorrow. Also, what's weird is she offered me the job on the spot after the interview. I had the interview today and after meeting with her and the CEO for about 2 hours, they gave me the offer. Edit: I also had a 2nd round interview at anther place, part time to full time, for $15 hour last Friday. Should I email them and let them know I got an offer? Sorry that was a long read.

2eo60d	-13332	1409092430	Accounting	Interview lasted 1 minute...	I just had an interview for a Jr. Staff Accountant position. I emailed the controller of the company my resume and cover letter. She called me 3 days later confirming my interview, with the regional director (She has nothing to do with accounting). She explained to me that the person I'm supposed to interview with is extremely busy with other stuff so I'm interviewing with her. I am currently an AP specialist working for multifamily. The company I just interviewed with also manages multifamily properties. To be honest, I thought I fit the role perfectly. I show up today to meet with the regional, and right off the bat she tells me she has to be somewhere in an hour. She then asks me about my past experience etc.. That's the only question she asks. She says, unfortunately you don't have the experience we are looking for and as some other candidates do have that experience. She says she will keep my resume in case another AP job comes up. She then states that I do not need to turn in my application forms. And then we leave. That's it. Just one question and telling me I don't have the expereince, when the job description states no experience. Here are the requirements: "Qualified candidate will have knowledge of GAAP, have problem solving and deductive reasoning skills, ability to multi-task and have a Bachelors of Science degree with emphasis in Accounting, or equivalent experience" I took a sick day off to help prepare for this interview. I think it's very unprofessional to have me interview for only one minute literally and just tell me right off the bat I'm not qualified. They should have never called me in and make me waste a day of work. They should have listed the required experience on the job posting. They should have let me know that there were others with more experience so I don't bother coming in and wasting my time to go to a one minute interview. My question is this very unprofessional, or normal? Is there anything I can do about it? Can I email the controller back who clearly saw my resume and clearly knew that I was a possible candidate? If she knew I wouldn't even get a chance to explain more than 2 minutes my qualifications why did she bother to call me in?Thanks in advance guys
2gxa5h	-13332	1411185657	Cartalk	Drove on flat tire - few miles	Hello everyone,So this morning I was driving on the freeway. I noticed a weird sound (not a pop) and my car system said to check tire pressure. I figured okay doesnt seem like it's flat so I'll just continue to drive to work. So I probably drive around 8 miles and then the tire becomes completely flat. I drive around 1 mile to a parking lot and replace the tire with a spare tire. There seems to be no puncture hole at all. My question is did my driving of 8 miles before it got completely flat - and around 1-1.5 miles of driving of completely flat destroy the tire that I must get a new one? The sidewall of the tire is a little softer in one area than others. Can I just go to a tire shop and they'll find the puncture hole and seal it up?Thanks!

2p1xqe	-13332	1418362689	Accounting	Got Promoted!!! Have some questions..	Hi Reddit,After a year of doing Accounts Payable work... I got promoted to a staff accountant position where I will be completely gone of AP work!! I got promoted from 36,000 to 43,000. I believe the 7k salary jump (20%) is a huge salary raise in terms of in-house raises, but I would still be getting paid under market rate for LA. However, my only question is if I accept this promotion, am I stuck here for a while? I have been looking for another staff accountant job for a good 4-5 months. I had a really good interview just today for a Staff Accountant job that I actually really really wanted... before I got this promotion literally 1 hour after I got back from the interview LOL. The CFO needs an answer by tomorrow or Monday at the latest. They are creating this staff accountant position entirely for me. However, I'm just a little tired of the company and real estate accounting in general. The company I interviewed at is a big entertainment company and the salary range is higher than the 43k I would be making. So let's say I accept the promotion, and 1-2 weeks later I get an offer from this entertainment company. I really can't leave without burning bridges right?Thanks in advanced.

389jtb	-13332	1433274722	jobs	New employer asking start date in two weeks - I'm asking for 3 weeks	Hello all,So I got an amazing offer from a great company. Only issue is start date. They want me to start in two weeks on the 15th. I want to start on the 22nd (they only allow start dates on Mondays). I haven't had a vacation in about 2 years and I need to tie up some loose ends in my personal life before starting new job. I also didn't put in my notice to my current employer yet because I wanted to make sure I officially signed and turned in my offer letter (which I wasn’t able to do because I was negotiating the start date). This creates another problem because I need to give two weeks notice. Since it’s already Tuesday – I already won’t be able to start until the 22nd if I do give a full two weeks’ notice. The reason they want me to start on the 15th is because they have two new employees in same department also starting on the 15th and they will start training them then. I emailed them saying I won’t be able to start on the 15th due to not informing my current employer of my 2 weeks’ notice. I now have a bad feeling this will reflect negatively on me at my new job. Am I making a big deal out of nothing? Or can this really start me off on a bad foot with the new job. I don’t want to lose the offer. But I just feel it’s necessary for me to have a few days off before starting.Thanks,

2amvop	-13344	1405307078	vancouver	Some guy hit my car... Need advice	http://imgur.com/3iA8kyBI was driving downtown during the traffic jam on Friday, I stopped at the stop line and was planning to make a right turn.  BOTH the traffic light and crossing lights were red at the time; with a crowd of pedestrians waiting on the sidewalk. I checked my surroundings and made sure there was no cars and pedestrians and pulled over the line a little. Out of the crowd a Caucasian male with tattoos wearing a jacket walked out onto the street and ran into the side of my car! He had an white iPhone and I believe he had a hidden metal object under his jacket because the sound of the impact was like 2 metal objects clashing together. The side of my car is steel and usually a person does not have force to make a dent in the steel with his body. He proceeded to hit my windshield with his iPhone to pretend to absorb the impact. After damaging my car he kept walking across the street and hit the back of another car that was on the crosswalk due to the traffic jam. Do you guys have any advice on what to do from here? Should I report this to the police? Thanks guys!

I will say the few I bave tried this year they feel a bit different but not really 'better' per se ..I guess I'm asking guys who've tried players with huge upgrades over their bases (Benn +7) you'd have to think he plays different/better but how much?I do play the occasional guy online whos players just have unreal puck control, but do these super stacked teams really make a difference over the just 'stacked base card' teams?Thoughts?

347rrd	-13345	1430264888	dogs	Dog diagnosed with diabetes.	My families dog(dachshund) has been diagnosed with diabetes, and my parents have decided on euthenasia.. I've offered to pay the vet bills(very expensive) and the insulin etc. However their not willing to give the needles twice a day. To be fair my father works out of town as well so its my mother. My younger sister who still lives at home said she would do the needles whenever she can(most days). However they won't budge, and have basically shown resentment towards me for trying to help.I love the dog very much, and I do not know what to do.. My hands are tied, and I'm trying everything I can.I hope they change their mind, the dog is only 8.5 and otherwise very healthy..It just seems ludicrous in my mind to put down a dog simply because it has diabetes.. Ultimately there's only so much I can do, but I'm conflicted and heartbroken.. So I needed to vent.Tl;dr my 8.5 yo dachshund has diabetes, and my parents plan on putting her down, because they feel the needles are too expensive, and too much of a hassle.

35zzfv	-13345	1431644063	Advice	Got a ticket for failure to stop, can I fight it?	Last night on a pitch black side street there's a stop sign at a set of railroad tracks. I STOPPED (obviously its a railroad, and its pitch black) the cop was a good distance behind me just turning onto the road. Anyways by the time he caught up to me I was already on another street. He pulls me over and gives me my first ticket ever, and tried to be a 'nice guy' about it.I feel with some pictures of the street showing how dark it is, and showing the sign which has both the railroad and stop sign touching (one right on top of the other) and showing how far down the road he finally pulled me over (showing he wasn't close enough to make fair judgment on whether or not I made a complete stop) I could perhaps fight this in court.My question is, is this a lost cause? It seems like a he said she said battle. My younger (19yo) sister was in the car and swears up and down I stopped. Or do I have a sound case here? Also the ticket says nothing about demerit points does that mean this doesn't carry any with it? I'm worried about insurance. This is in Alberta, Canada.Tl;dr I got a ticket for failing to stop, on pitch black street, where the cop wasn't in a good position to make the judgment call. I have a witness, and I DID stop.Thanks

Hey Bros, first time starting my own post, and pretty new to the whole reddit thing.About 6 months ago I finally came to terms with being gay.  I have always known but I was never ready to accept it.  So in January I started having fun with guys and all that jazz.2 months ago I started to have bad anxiety with the stress of school, multiple jobs, and having to sneak around and lie all the time about who I was with.  So, I finally came out to my parents, sister, and my core group of friends.  Everyone was more than accepting, not that I was expecting anything else.So this brings my to telling my room mates...  I am currently out of town for the summer and will be going back in september for another year of school and have a lease signed already with them.  Also, they are coming to visit me while I'm out of town for a long weekend.  I'm not really sure how they are going to take it.  ALSO, the second part of this, one of my really good friends is coming to visit me this week.  We used to hook up all throughout high school and were an "unofficial couple".  We are really close, and have always been.  I'm not worried she isn't going to be excepting, I'm just not sure when to tell her.So My Question to you Bros is, when do I tell them?  Do I tell them before they come to visit? Or when they get here? Or, for the roommates, do I wait until I move back in with them for the school year?Update: ex hook up just got to town, and told her as soon as she got in the car.  She started crying saying she was so happy for me... Now for the room mates!
1jph7k	-13347	1375659601	gaybros	Update for Telling my roomates	Finally decided to rip off the band aid and text my room mates (who are back in Philly, and I'm currently in LA for the summer).  They were MORE than accepting and asked to go to a gay bar when they come to visit! I cannot explain how happy I am.  Now I've told everyone that I needed and wanted to tell.  Such a relief.  So Thank You all for your support and your posts.  It really helped me reading from your experiences.Thanks bros! 
1lduax	-13347	1377841274	gaybros	Cross Country Road Trip!	Hey Bros, In a few weeks I'll be taking a road trip with my 3 best friends (since kindergarten) from LA - Philly.  I've been in LA for the summer for an internship, and now sadly I must return to the east coast for my last year of school.So, I was wondering if anyone has done this before, and if so what fun things did you do?  We are taking the north route (since I took the South route on the way here.)Any weird/fun ideas are much appreciated.  We are looking for like outdoorsy adventurous things.  And of course weird shit like the worlds largest bottle of ketchup.

So I havent really been around so we could "talk".I have just recently started seeing someone, and want to bring it up.  My parents always talk about my sisters boyfriend, who they have never actually met in person (my sister is in Germany for a year for work).  When I came out, my parents were accepting and fine with it.  But if I bring anything "Gay" up, my dad just shuts down and stops talking.  My mom just gets awkward and I change the subject.The most recent incident was my 11 year old cousin, who knows I'm gay, said that I am not a noticable Gay.  My aunt was laughing, my dad sat there looking at his phone, my mom was like "oh well then."   Its things like this that make me not want to go home, because its just gets awkward with them.  So, Mmy question is when did your parents come around and start talking about stuff with you without it being awkward?
1wxck0	-13347	1391462783	askgaybros	Help for Parents	Hey guys, Was wondering if you had any suggestions for websites or books for parents to help with the news. Also, any information/articles on how parents can deal with telling their friends?My parents are accepting, they just need time to become used to it.  I have a boyfriend, who they have met, and who is most likely reading this post... [Hi Joe!](http://static2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131007214133/disney/images/thumb/9/9a/Frozen-olaf-600x388.jpg/258px-Frozen-olaf-600x388.jpg)... I told them that I know its going to take time for them to be comfortable with this.  So I said I would look for some websites/articles/books that can answer some of their questions.  Thanks dudes!

lq38n	-13356	1319659866	Edmonton	The current downtown arena deal according to my councillor, Kerry Diotte	I hear you loud and clear.Although I like the vision of a new downtown arena, Edmontonians are telling me they want a much better deal to build it and operate it -- and I will continue to push for that.    It's still lacking a $100 million contribution from the province and the City's been told that money is not forthcoming.    **Many people point out that the original Katz Group contribution was to be $100 million, but now that money will come in at just $5.5 million a year.**    What's more, **the Katz Group wants the City to give it $2 million each year for 10 years to pay to advertise Edmonton and the Oilers.**    Many taxpayers are upset that the Katz Group will get all revenue from all sports and events at the new arena even though the City will own the rink.    Besides all that we still don't know the total amount of dollars the City will contribute to the entire project including the interest on a loan of at least $350 million the city will take out to kickstart the arena.    Nor do we know what the arena will look like. Key elements in the original sketches produced by the Katz Group have changed dramatically. **For instance, the impressive Winter Garden that was to have spanned 104 Avenue, is now not part of the arena project. It's slated instead to be a pedway.**  We need to get back to the table and renegotiate this deal so it's a win-win for taxpayers, the City and the Katz Group.    A new downtown arena is a great idea, but it must be done right and the majority of Edmontonians must support the key aspects of the deal.    Thanks again for taking the time to express your views.    Do you receive my monthly e-newsletter?  If not, I'd be pleased to send it to you. -KerryKerry Diotte,Ward 11 City Councillor,#1 Sir Winston Churchill Square,Edmonton, AB T5J 2R7780-496-8142

After two attempts it dawns on me, that I no longer have a support droid with me.  I check the quest text in the tracker and there's not a button to summon like there was in previous quests.  Anyone else run into this?EDIT: Gonna reset the instance and try again this evening.  Hopefully without dinging mid fight!  Thanks, folks!

I love the gritty, barbaric feel of the buildings, lands and heroes of the Horde and always found the Alliance experience to feel too clean and sterile.  I've played Horde since launch.  Aside from the occasional curious dalliance with throwaway lowbies that I then delete (all pre-Cata), I've never experienced any Alliance content.I was about to cancel my subscription as I'm just horribly bored with endgame and I've done most, if not all, of the Horde 1-60 leveling content, when it occurred to me that there's a whole other faction to experience.  So, I throw it out there to you who've played both sides, is it worth sticking around for?

So, we know at this point that WoW has lost around five million subscribers since the launch of WoD back in November.  That's a huge number, obviously, and I'm just baffled about where those people went.  Obviously, some of them must have ended up proverbially turning off their machines and going outside, but you'd think that with a drop off that large we'd be hearing about huge (relatively) subscription/registration spikes in other MMOs.  Personally, being one of the five million myself, I've been doing more SW:TOR (I'm a subscriber) and am considering getting back into Wildstar.

The calculator I've been using has been giving me, this entire time, about 144/145 pounds of lean body mass, so, I don't have that much muscle for my height.My shoulders are about 17-18 inches, and I'm not looking to get 24 inch shoulers or anything, I'd just like to hit 20, become a little less stick like, have more of a V shape. I plan on working out my back and shoulders twice a week. At the moment I dont' believe I have much muscle mass in either area, and I know both areas are believe to help the person appear wider. So...anyone have any ideas, anecdotes? 
12sx2d	-13400	1352305648	AskReddit	Has a pill/drug turned your life around?	
1cz83k	-13400	1366766144	NFL_Draft	My first (and probably only) mock draft. One round plus a little. Yes, I did mock the guards late.	1. KC - Luke Joeckel: This pick is already locked in. 2. Jac - Dion Jordan: Pass rushers are the most important players after QBs as far as drafting is concerend, and he's the consensus best. The Jags could take Fisher, but I don't see it. Britton is decent and you don't draft RT at 2nd overall. The Jags will pretend they can count on Gabbert for one more year, so I don't see QB either since no one is surefire. Besides, Geno Smith is an awfully similar prospect to Gabbert.3. TRADE Arizona moves up to ensure they get Eric Fisher. Oakland has a weak roster and needs all the picks it can get. I would assume this years second and a mid rounder this or next year would do it. Arizona is a team that is pretty strong on defense, and has to tie their offense together. 4. Eagles - Geno Smith. I don't like him but when teams don't have a QB, they get them, even if they're not a sure thing. This has been proven over and over again. Miami last year, us the year before and the Titans, and the Jags taking players with question marks or limited ability.5. Lions - Eziekel Ansah DE: Fits here awfully well. They only have two DEs on their roster right now and "neither should be starting". They can worry about their offensive line and secondary in rounds 2 and 3. 6. Browns - Dee Millner CB: Consensus top CB that might be a bit overdrafted here, but Cleveland would probably be happy to pair with Haden for the next 10 years, ideally. Cleveland has a stronger roster than you might expect. For now they don't really need those top priority guys, the 3-4 OLB, the QB, The #1 WR, the LT. The only other player I could see them taking here is Star.7. Oakland- Sharif Floyd: They go ahead and grab the player most people are mocking to them at 3. 8. Bills - Matt Barkley QB: According to walterfootball the Bills have given just about every QB in the top 10 a private workout. None of the guys are worth taking here, so they go with the winner, and the guy that will probably impress them most in interviews. They are looking to take a QB, there is no doubt, and they'll convince themselves that someone is worth it. If not in the first, the second, but I think they go early. If it's not Barkley it'll be Nassib. 9. Jets - Ryan Nassib QB: Speaking of Nassib, here's a guy that will also interview well going to another team looking for the answer at QB. Again, when a team doesn't have an answer at QB, it seems that in this day and age they'll do anything to get one. They also get to drop the guilt of "wasting" a pick now that they have two first rounders. I think they may even trade up to get him. It'd be awfully hard to go from USC QB to USC QB if he Bills take Nassib. 10. TRADE Carolina - Star Lotulelei: He falls no further in my prediction. The Titans could use him, but they could also use a lot of other players, and at least have something at the position. The Panthers cupboard is bare, and they won't want to risk missing out on a top talent. 11. Chargers - Lane Johnson OT: This pick is easy. They need a LT, and here's a potential franchise player. No team will take a guard over a LT prospect, so if Johnson is here, Warmack and Cooper will continue to fall.12. Miami - DJ Fluker OT: They let Jake Long go, and Johnathan Martin was a disaster last year. They need insurance for Martin and someone else to start at tackle. They need to protect their young QB more than they need to get a CB early in a pretty good draft for them. I want to put Watson here, but Fluker seems like a sure thing at RT, and Watson has high bust potential even if he has a better shot at being a LT. I don't think Miami can afford high pick son Martin and Watson an have them both bust. 13. Jets - Mingo OLB: It would appear they are weak at this important position. I thought WR first, but they're actually set there believe it or not. Hill, Kerley who had a good year and is young, and Holmes. Barnes isn't a long term solution, and they have no one else so that means Mingo to me. 14. Titans - Sheldon Richardson DT: Probably the best non-guard left, and I think we saw last year that guards don't go early. 15. Saints - Manelik Watson OT: He's probably the last shot in this draft at starting LT, and they'll have to take that shot.16. Rams - Tavon Austin WR: They get the guy everyone else has mocked to them, and why not? Bradford did so well with Amendola, why not upgrade that connection with Austin. This gives them insurance at WR if Quick doesn't work out. Austin is a playmaker.17. Steelers - Jarvis Jones OLB: I like this pick more than Patterson because it keeps with the Steelers identity. They've made due with mid round receivers for...well, a long time. I think they're locked into a WR pick in the 2nd, but they should still be able to grab someone decent there. 18. Dallas - Chance Warmack OG: They'll probably be plenty happy to take this immovable object here. They need an upgrade at 4 out of 5 positions, but luckily those 4 are not LT. They'll have a lot easier time putting together a passable line with Warmack on it.19. Giants - Alec Ogletree OLB/ILB: It'll be hard to pass on a three down linebacker when they need two. They're a pretty solid, if unspectacular team across the board, but one place they do have a gaping hole is linebacker. 20. Bears - Manti Teo MLB: They need a linebacker more than any other position. He will probably never be the star that he was in college, but he knows how to play the position, and it seems the Bears need that desperately.21. Bengals - Arthur Brown OLB: Seems like the best fit for the team. Safety goes here in a lot of drafts, but Reggie Nelson will start, and Mays/Illoka/Sands are all young players drafted in the last 3 years that can duke it out for the other starting position. 22. Rams - Kenny Vaccaro S: Tends to go higher than this. I'm not a big fan. The guy is beautifully fluid, but is extremely easily blocked, and takes himself out of plays all the time. Fills a big need for the Rams though. 23. Vikings - Justin Hunter WR: Everyone says Hunter didn't look as explosive last year, but he sure must have improved in some way since all his numbers did. I didn't take Paterson because I think Patterson is a complimentary player, someone that's great to have when you already have two solid WRs that will run routes, and be where they're supposed to be, that need to be covered, and then you can sneak an underneath pass to him in space. Hopkins spreads poo on walls and has less upside than Hunter. I think Woods gives us what Jennings does. Allen...I like him, he'd be my second option here, but 4.71 speed...there just aren't many guys that make it with that, that aren't special cases like Boldin, or from 25 years ago. I take him here because I wouldn't be surprised if a team traded into Indy's spot if we don't (aka the Texans).24. TRADE San Franciso 49ers - Jonathan Cyprien: They have the ammo, and will likely use it to ensure they get the player they want. Harbaugh took Aldon Smith, Colin Kaepernick, and AJ Jenkins. To me this means that Harbaugh is enticed by athleticism and upside. He loves guys that run, and run well. Of their positions of need, that would mean Safety, and Cyprien fits the bill. 25. TRADE: Atlanta Falcons Tank Carradine DE: I have CBs and DEs falling, and the Falcons need both, but they're more likely to get a contributing CB in the 2nd than a starting DE. They have Osi, but he's a stop gap that has a decent chance of offering nothing for them. Their other stater, Biermann is nothing special. Carradine has the most upside of the remaining DEs including offering the most as a pass rusher. The Falcons have had a subpar pass rush for a very long time, and were 28th in the league in sacks last year. They should want to jump NE and Denver and anyone else that may trade up to get their guy. 26. TRADE Jacksonville - Desmond Trufant CB: He fell all the way here. I feel like the corners are a little overrated in this draft. There are a lot of 2nd/3rd round guys, but not really any great 1st rounders. Trufant doesn't have great size or run support, for instance. He still should be able to stick to anyone, and that's probably the rarest trait to find in corners. You can always find guys that can contribute. Pairing Trufant with someone from later in the draft is a pretty good strategy. 27. Houston Texans - DeAndre Hopkins: Finally, they get someone to play across from Andre Johnson. 28. Denver - Bjoern Werner DE: Falls down here due to being viewed as a bit limited in upside, but I think Denver will love the value at the position of need. I also think a strong guy like Werner will optimize Von Miller's productivity. 29. NE Patriots - Cordarelle Patterson WR: Bill Belicheck getting his hands on this guy is scary, and I suspect he knows that. Patterson has Hall of Fame potential, and is every bit as good with the ball in his hands as Percy Harvin. It's rare to find someone who runs so naturally around a football field. It's a really good fit, and gives the Patriots offense some more explosion.30. Minnesota Vikings - D.J. Hayden CB: I thought he was overhyped because of the story behind him, but he's a really good player. I'd give him 8/10 speed, 9/10 quickness, 9/10 awareness, 8/10 run support (for a corner anyway). 31. Colts - Datone Jones DE: A position of need and one of the best players available. 32. TRADE Lions - Jonathan Cooper OG: The Ravens need help, but not as much as the Lions need a corner or Guard, and if Cooper falls this far, I expect a team will look to trade up for him, and the Lions may be in the best position to do this. I would have loved to have the Cardinals make this move, but I sacrificed their second to ensure they got Fisher. 33. Packers - Matt Elam Safety - I don't think Eifert because they seem to like Finley who is pretty productive even with the drops. WR seems like a no to me too. Drafting in the second round just seems to work for them, and plus they have Jones, Nelson, and Cobb. They could use depth, but a first rounder? No.34. 49ers - Tyler Eifert TE: He can't go much later than this and I'm sure a Delanie Walker replacement (and upgrade) would be a positive. A player that can be special at his position. 35. Eagles - Xavier Rhodes CB: They'll sprint to the podium to call his name36. Ravens - Kevin Minter LB: There is no good OT option here, so that leaves MLB, WR, or safety. I think they'll be able to go WR and safety later, and while Minter isn't great, neither is the rest of this, in my opinion, completely horrendous linebacker class. Minter is the last decent option to have as a starter. And he's not bad, he just has his limitations. He'd probably be best paired off with a really athletic guy next to him, but they may have to wait until next year if McClain doesn't work out. I'm of the minority that he will, even with the most recent arrest, but we'll see.

1kduq4	-13400	1376523959	nfl	Question for Jets fans: Why did Jeremy Kerley have so many fair catches last year?	He led the league. I was checking out stats, and this was very odd because of his low number of returns. 36 fair catches, and only 19 returns. The second highest number of fair catches was Marcus Sherels for the Vikings with 27, but he had 32 returns. The only other player with this sort of imbalance of FCs to RETs was Davone Bess with 4 returns and 18 fair catches. So I'd be interested in hearing from Miami fans as well. Overall, I'd say it's average for a returner to have about 60% returns, and 40% fair catches. As a secondary question, since I'm on the subject of Kerley, do you guys think he's legit? He had a respectable year last year, somewhat quietly outside of Fantasy Football fans. Or was it more of a situation where there really was no one else?

Sony released consoles in 2006, 2000, and 1994/1995 (Japan/US for PS1). Sony's stock took off mid-1999, and peaked at 150 the day before the Playstation 2 came out. All that lead up, I would assume, can be attributable to ps2 and probably DVD player sales, maybe? The stock had an increase again in 2006 at the end of the year when PS3 came out. There was a similar jump in 2005. The stock price fell when the market fell in 2007/8, and has never really recovered. The stock is lower right now than it has been since 1993 (with one 2:1 split, if that matters). With historic jumps over the Christmas season, and the stock as low as it is, isn't now the time to buy on it? I see no reason to not expect PS4 to sell. It has had no bad press that I've heard about is really the only main console to be challenging Xbox, and Xbox 360 and PS3 sold essentially the same amount, only now XboxOne is priced HIGHER than PS4, and has had bad press. Anyone? I should also mention that I don't know the difference between SNE and the other stocks that seem attributable to sony, one of which is trading at 2k a share.I mean, if I am right about all of this, none of it is a stretch, or anything an average person wouldn't figure out, so why hasn't there already been a rise in SNE price similar to what was seen in mid-1999.

1qqgl5	-13400	1384567381	ender	No, there is nothing we can do to 'fix' the movie, and no, the casting was not atrocious.	We got the about the best two hour movie of Ender's Game that there could be. Looking back over what was included, what exactly are you looking to cut? Would it really save that much time? Is it a clear scene that needs to be trimmed? Can you really not play devils advocate enough with any included material you may not fine optimal, to understand why it was included?Most of us realize that it needed to be longer. The payoffs were there, but the build up WS minimal. The studios, the budget, the need to get H.Ford on screen a disproportionate amount of time were all working against the peak the movie may achieve. For a movie, 7/10, for being biased and loving book, 8/10, and for a 2 hour adaptation that it had to be to be made, 9.5/10As for the castingAsa: To me it was Oscar worthy. He had to show huge range and hit every time. Getting his character right, the actor right, was half the battle, and only if everyone else stood out as bad could it be called atrocious. But they weren't.Harrison Ford: Most certainly did not phone it inYou may call it a little cliche, but he still gave a good performance. He was a gruffer Graff in my opinion, hotter, but I don't feel as though any of the character motivations or inner thoughts were compromised.Viola Davis: Did a great job as well. Anderson, and I'd have to go back and read the shadow series, always seemed there to be a foil for Graff's thoughts. They took that, and turned it up about 10 notches. This was probably my least favorite part of the movie, at least where missteps are concerned. See, it's pandering and leading to the audience to have a character say, oh, they're children, you don't see them as children. Hey audience, FEEL THIS!!!!! Nevertheless, Viola Davis did well. Besides, to me Anderson could have been a cardboard cutout, or Ford talking to his hand and it would not have besmudged my memory of the character.The kid playing Peter really stood out to me as a hit.Valentine was a hit as well.The parents were more fully fleshed out in other books. In Ender's Game, they're rather non-distinct. I suspect that is a writing choice having them as how a five year old would see them. Just mom and dad. In the movie I think they had their back stories more intact, but you see this more with the father than the mother. But, how many are saying they're miscast. They both did well.Any issues with Petra are likely more due to writing than acting. Miscast? To womanly? Hello, they all got aged up.The other battle school kids hardly got enough screen time to warrant criticism. That's more relevant for one of the next two.Many did not like then guy playing Bean, his delivery more than anything I suspect, but, he was asked to do so little, and show so little range, That I don't think anyone should pass judgment, at least wait till the kid gets to deliver more than two lines of dialogue at a time.So now to the real focal piece, the guy playing Bonzo. Yes. He should have been taller. Yes, it really hurt the feel of the fight.In other words, I'd rather see a support for a movie that deserves it, then the butchers getting a platform to bitch.

However, the last scene made it pretty clear that the inevitable conflict with Hank is partially, if not nearly entirely why we find Walter White celebrating his 52nd birthday alone, with a new identity, and a need for high caliber weapons.  It kinda shines a new light on the questions we all already had about the scene.  I'd like to hear some of you guys'/gals' thoughts on this.  I apologize if this seems dumb or too obvious, but unfortunately, none of my friends watch Breaking Bad, so I never get to nerd out about it.

Long story short my mom took my cat to the vet last night and he was diagnosed as being FiV positive.  Because it was a last minute appointment she didn't get in to see our regular vet and had to see a vet we've never dealt with before.  Basically the vet told her to have him put to sleep then and there and then to have our other cats checked to see if they also tested positive (cue me thinking she wants me to euthanize all my cats O_O).  My mom asked her how it was transmitted and what she should do to disinfect the areas he had been in and the vet really wasn't able to tell her anything.I've got a call in to my regular vet and we are waiting back for blood test results, but does anyone have any experience with this?  He's lost a little weight and has been acting 'sick' but we never expected anything like this!  I've had him for 12 years and I just can't imagine putting him to sleep when it doesn't seem like he's dying ;_;  I've looked at some things online and it seems like people do keep cats that are FiV+ but I would love to hear from someone who has!

If it makes it more exciting for you it could be an in case of zombie emergency car kit.

The item was purchased last night and I received this message today:&gt;I purchased this item from you yesterday 5/1013 and it says it may take until 5/22/13 to arrive! 12 days? You are in Ohio, I am in FL, unless you are sending this by boat, it cannot take that long.Please be sure to send the item so that it arrives here in a much more reasonable amount of time.The shipping was free but I always ship first class with tracking. Unfortunately I won't be able to ship it till tue morning, though I believe it will still get there by Friday.  I'm not really sure the best way to tell the customer this and sound professional and I have a feeling they'll still be unhappy:( Any advice?

What do I do???? I made a temporary home for it in a tiny tank using water from one of my betta tanks and some of the plants it came with but is that the best thing to do?

2ky5fq	-13442	1414811168	tifu	TIFU by trying to keep my puppy from eating a leaf.	Just took my 8 week old malamute puppy for a quick walk outside trying to burn off some energy so that we can all get some rest tonight. You'd think she'd be tired after destroying my living room but after spending twenty minutes cleaning up toys, the stuffing that used to be toys, my ripped up carpet, and mopping up where she had knocked over the water bowl (twice), so far I'm the only tired one.  Of course it's raining and generally gross so she didn't even want to leave the porch but finally I convinced her to venture forward.  After a couple of minutes I'm cold and wet but hopeful that she'll exhaust herself with her frolicking through the yard. As we walk back onto the porch I see her stop and stare at the leaves and then leap and grab one and carry it with her. At this moment holding her leaf she looks like the most adorable puppy ever but of course I can't let her eat it. Knowing my luck she'll be barfing leaf for the rest of the night while I try to desperately get a tiny bit of sleep before work. I reach down and do the patented mom scoop and remove the leaf. Wow I think that's a pretty big chunk of leaf, oh no! Maybe she grabbed an acorn?! So I keep scooping and the whole thing comes out in a big clump. One maple leaf and one dead mouse.  A SOGGY DECEASED RODENT THAT I TOUCHED WITH MY FINGERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I can't think about it without almost horking up my dinner, pretty sure I got mouse bits under my nails.  It was so slimy and limp and ughhhhhh i'll never forget the way it felt. The worst part is that now it's out laying on my porch and the chances of me forgetting it's there and having this happen all over again are considerable.

hcmo2	-13443	1305562984	woodworking	Question about use of paste wax	Hello woodworking!  I'm about as far from an woodworking expert as you can get; in spite of this, I decided I was smart/capable enough to try and fix a nice scratch in the table caused by my cat's claws.Per the advice of the manufacturer, I lightly buffed the scratch with a 0000 steel wool and applied a layer of paste wax to the table top to attempt to hide the damage.  At first I applied the paste wax in a circular pattern before buffing, however upon buffing I found that doing so left an obvious circular pattern on the table top.  I decided that if I tried to re-apply wax, with the grain, it would look better.  Let it dry, and buffed again.I found that second application worked fairly well, however there is still an unreasonably high amount of gloss on the table.  Additionally, the area where I tried to smooth out the scratch seems to have lost the texture that the rest of the table has.I expect that scratched area which I used the steel wool on is a lost cause in terms of texture; however, is there a good low-impact abrasive I would use on the rest of the table to minimize the glossy appearance to some degree??  The cloth I was using didn't really do the trick - maybe the rough side of one of the green scrubby sponges used in a kitchen?Thanks!

However what I am hoping to do moreso, though, is create a new project with in which I can create a new web service provider which conforms to the WSDL, rather than have a reference through which I can consume a web service.

md7su	-13443	1321375419	Health	Frequent burping, abdominal pain?	Hi Reddit Health - My wife has had problems recently where she has had problems with frequent burping (like every few seconds) and abdominal pain.  This typically happens closer to the end of the day, and is typically worse when she exercises.She's gone to the doctor a few times, and been treated for heartburn (Omeprazole and Prevacid), neither of which helped.  She had an endoscopy which found no signs of any heartburn induced trauma.Then she went to have a ultrasound of her gall bladder - she has a family history of gall bladder issues - but that showed no problems.  A second doctor (family friend) indicated it's possible that there could still be a gall bladder issue that's not detectable via ultrasound. She has a appointment with a GI doctor coming up in a few weeks, but was wondering if anyone else has experienced something like this?  I am not looking for a true diagnosis given the limited info, just if anyone has endured a similar scenario and found an unusual cause.  Note: She is not pregnant.Thanks!

What about this deal merits AOL jumping 43% today?  Does the deal signal that AOL will have the means to reinvest in the business (or acquire) to achieve better business moving forward?I would have figured a one-time influx of cash, even of this magnitude, wouldn't trigger a move this big.

135jk5	-13443	1352854053	conservatives	Thoughts from a "thoughtful 10%" independent	I wanted to say thanks for being one of the more persuasive and informative conservative writers out there.A few pieces of food for thought.  I consider myself an independent, and consider the idea that the broader conservative media has failed the GOP and conservatives to be a persuasive one - but in a bit of a different way than most suggest.While I think Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter do add to the amount of vitriol and anger in the country, I assess they are generally preaching to the conservative choir (ie. the conservatives who obviously aren't part of Romney's 47% "takers", or thoughtful 10%).  Their actions didn't really have a substantial consequence to the election the way that some may suggest.Where I think the conservative media failed, was in giving the Republican message some intellectual depth.  The platitudes and ideological cries echoed by a lot of leading conservative writers I read, are doing a disservice to their readers.  David Brooks is a leading example of this - though I don't see any better from other more conservative publications (Weekly Standard?)For example: take one of the more prominent GOP talking points on why they should be elected: the debt.  While most would not realize the futility in campaigning directly against a completely lagging indicator in itself such as the debt, the GOP peddled policies to fight the debt such as "cut taxes and regulations". While you can't blame the TV spots for not conveying this message, you can blame the conservative media for not legitimizing it.  As a person who votes non-ideologically, and practically instead, I am strongly sold on the evidence based writings of people like conservatively-derided-as-repugnant Paul Krugman. I suspect the problem is that there is no intellectual legitimacy to these arguments.  Until I see otherwise, I will continue to vote Democrat; the Republicans will continue to deserve to lose, and I will continue to believe that in spite of my personal desire to vote in favor of "keeping what you earn" as an American ideal, that supporting this platform may be ideologically and personally convenient, but intellectually lazy and most likely detrimental to the success of the country.  Failure to mitigate this feeling is the failing of the conservative media.So tell me: how can 30% tax cuts provide substantial growth?  Where are taxes killing jobs?  Which regulations will be removed in a way that doesn't disproportionally impact American citizens' health or the environment, to improve the economy?  Most notably: which loopholes and "base broadening" measures can be pursued to support this?  The combination of these issues makes for a pitifully executed campaign, and a conservative media that has let them down.
136m54	-13443	1352906294	investing	Debt reductions mechanisms and responsible governance	So I was considering what the various debt reduction opportunities available to Congress should be.  Wanted to see r/investing stance on these opinions. I see four (and a half) options which are reasonably available for the government to pursue, and why I think they should or shouldn't be pursued. I know my biases will slant my comments in a liberal direction, which I can't dispute.  The most prominent qualifier I use in assessing each of these, is, "what is the impact on demand"?  If I am wrong, educate me why.  If not, maybe you'll be a more informed person as a result.- RAISE TAXES.  This will increase revenue, thus diminishing the deficit.  Applied to only high earners, who may feel a bit of pain (obviously this is the heavily emphasized point by the right as being an ideologically immoral  and unAmerican option, which should be opposed), will likely only receive a nominal disincentive to invest; the extent of this disincentive likely won't have a disproportionate impact to said investment.  An investment is either good or bad; a smart investor knows this, and the tax consequences are only so consequential to their decision making process.  Main policy advocated by Democrats.- ENCOURAGE ECONOMIC GROWTH.  Primarily done by cutting taxes and regulations; the Republicans and Democrats both advocate cutting the corporate tax rate (by different degrees), while only the Republicans advocate cutting income, estate, and capital gains taxes.  Certainly elimination of the estate tax will have little effect other than a reduction in revenues, thus exacerbating our deficit problems.  Income and capital gains cuts, in certain conditions, absolutely would encourage growth.  However, I don't believe this is plausible in today's conditions; this is because it suggests that there is a large,  latent amount of economic growth that can be achieved through an additional, nominal incentive such as a tax break.  Again, similar to my first point, tax implications are only a portion of what constitutes a good or bad investment.  I'd argue that in light of the high un- and under-employment rates in the country, the lack of investment is a consequence of insufficient demand to service with said investment; tax-rate oriented disincentives are borderline unrelated to our absence of investment which we are plagued with.- CUT SPENDING.  Conservatives indicate this is only way to cut the debt.  Liberals concede this has to be a part of the solution.  Liberals deride this similar to the way in which Conservatives deride tax hikes.  While PBS, Planned Parenthood and R&amp;D certainly should be evaluated, they really only constitute a couple thimbles of water relative to our rapidly-filling rowboat (and whose merits *could* be hugely beneficial to the national best interest).  So, Social Security, Medicare, and Defense are only reasonable targets remaining.      Conservatives will reject any attempt to cut defense as limiting our capabilities to protect the nation. Are there no types of spending that match the following criteria? 1. Does it protect our troops? 2. Does is provide a defense against a credible threat?  3. Does it put the nation's interests in jeopardy?  I'd contend that there is a massive amount of defense spending which doesn't answer these questions.  However, cutting that spending is likely to hurt quality American jobs and consequently reduce demand, so it shouldn't be disproportionately pursued.      That leaves Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid.  Certainly out-of-control growth in health care has left these programs in a bad spot.  Responsible identification of costs which don't improve patients' health should overwhelmingly be pursued as a cost reduction mechanism.  Outside of these largely undebatable prerogatives, you will end up substantially impacting seniors and children whom the programs service.  Demand-creating entitlements which seniors worked for decades to fund will be diverted from them to service the debt, or perhaps fund tax cuts which are discussed in the second bullet.- OBAMACARE.  I consider this a "half" of an opportunity, because it's implications relate to both my previous points of cutting spending and encouraging growth.  Certainly this has a morally compelling component in that it insures tens of millions of people who basically are deemed only good enough to receive emergency room care.  This is a more dubious area to defend economically - you could state that increased health care across that population will spur growth and jobs in the health care industry.  However this comes at the cost of jobs potentially lost, and growth killed.  Likely the weakest point in the liberal's offering.- The last one that no one talks about: INCREASED INFLATION.  I'd argue this should be the most aggressively pursued option.  Here is why.  In devaluing the dollar, you spur multiple positives: One, you encourage growth of manufacturing and other areas which currently are more effective to outsource overseas, making the US more competitive.  Two - you discourage capital to sit stagnant, simply collecting nominal interest as a better alternative to investing in non optimal investments.  This will encourage spending and growth.  Three -  you inherently devalue the debt itself.      Now, you may argue that you will hurt the spending power of individuals, including low wage earners and particularly seniors.  However, in the context of these options, hurting seniors in growth-encouraging way is much better than one where you're going take away their medicare and social security, which certainly also substantially hurts them at least as much as moderately higher inflation rate (if not more).      This point underscores why Rick Perry and his threats against the Fed indicate he is a stupid man.  So gold goes up: who cares?  Gold is a non-value-creating asset, which is simply a hedge against inflation.  Any investor will tell you that.  As a result, you have people now investing in goods and services, which actually promote growth, at which point you do risk rising interest rates and spiking inflation which could become an actual threat: if this is case, the Fed has the tools to suppress these risks; making this a very good problem to potentially have.  (Note: while you may illustrate the risk in it, we are the reserve currency of the world, and there is no legitimate threat currently to supplant us, so there's that.)Discuss.(EDIT: formatting)

If so how do you control what's played?- Do receivers have visual interfaces with which you can control streaming content?I believe my question really centers around whether a receiver can act as a client itself for wireless consuming streaming media, or whether this is not a cost effective or achievable option without a simple alternative device which can be inputted into the receiver.

My wife and I really don't feed them that much - &lt; 2 cups of the Iams ProHealth (orange bag) per day, which they need to share.  I have sporadically (every week or two) found vomit (some undigested kibble, some more liquid-y) in the basement where they sleep - though the past couple days they both have been vomiting more frequently.  I did take one of them in for an exam a month or two ago, and they ultimately took an XRay and saw he was constipated and gave him an enema (yikes!).  This same cat was the one I actually saw throwing up the other day, so I brought him in for a blood test.  However, last night I noticed that the other cat actually threw up while the first one was sequestered in the basement.Does anyone have any experience dealing with this type of issue?

33ljbe	-13443	1429799656	HVAC	Air Handler Oversized?	Hey all,I just got my old Trane heat pump/air handler/backup heat unit replaced, with a new Daikin system.As I've heard, the equipment is fairly comparable brand to brand, and installation specs are the most important part of the job.  The vendor that did the work, recommended that I move from a 3 ton system to 3.5 ton system with a variable speed air handler; since they did the work, the unit has been effective at heating (and presumably cooling, though it hasn't been warm enough yet to need AC).However the sound from the unit is pretty overwhelming, particularly when the backup heat is running.  A technician came out and reduced the CFM, and then they even installed a new supply (saying that it was moving too much air).  Even now, it still sounds like I have an industrial exhaust fan running with backup heat, even in the further rooms in the house.  When the variable speed hits the highest speed also, it is then also quite noticeably noisy.Is my option to try and get them to downsize back to a 3 ton?  If so, is this just an air handler changeout, or does the condensor/rest of the system need to be swapped out also?This is annoying...  any advice?  Thanks!

The technician indicated that while each supply had a healthy airflow, it wasn't &lt;blasting&gt;, so cfm isn't really the problem, rather the mechanics of the unit itself (heat pump/variable speed daikin air handler). What their suggestion is, is that they will install noise reduction liners in the supply lines.My gut feeling is that my duct sizing is too small, and the jump to the 3.5 ton system causes a systemic problem with sound, and that the acoustic liner is just a cop out by the vendor - any thoughts?

3gh2i3	-13443	1439220282	HomeImprovement	Built-in Cabinetry and Flooring Question	Hello,I'm looking to do a bit of remodeling in my family room and was looking for some advice regarding how to proceed with installation of new flooring and cabinetry.Currently, I have a carpet desperately in need of replacement (we're probably going to replace with Pergo laminate and an area rug), as well as some shoddy old built-in cabinets on both sides of my fireplace.  I intend to replace both; the question I wasn't sure of, was whether the floor should go under the new built-in cabinets I am getting built, or have the cabinets sit right on the (concrete slab) floor (with any moisture barrier or anything needed in that capacity provided as well).On one hand, I am hoping these cabinets are a long term solution, and that it makes more sense to put the cabinets on the concrete and build the floors up to the front of the cabinet, rather than under them.  Conversely, I could place the cabinets on top of the flooring, and if additional flooring work/replacement was needed in the future, I could remove any screws or whatever is attaching the cabinet to the studs behind it.Any insight regarding whether one method is better than another?

2magot	-13449	1415978768	leagueoflegends	To Fix my Lord and Savior	My lord, Teemo has sent me an idea one night. An idea of which might make him relevant in the 'scene' again. I'd love to see him actually something viable to be chosen. Not because he's broken, but because he has something to be put on the table.What I'd like to see is that his E is moved to a passive with his Q (Toxic shot on Poison Dart), give him a new E on top of that. His passive is irrelevant (Only used very briefly for very small situations), so why not give him something similar to Kha'zix's ? In his lore, he was always by himself, so him having a bonus for 'isolating' his opponent would make sense. "But what about his stealth?" I'unno, leave it in? It doesn't do much for him. But last but not least, his shrooms. Give him 7 like Corki's, cooldown is fine. 3 isn't enough.Now, with all these OP buffs, we gotta nerf him down a bit. His Q's an instant-hit, which I've noticed riot is trying to get rid of. So turn it into a skill shot that still blinds. Done, pow. Nerf down his AP ratios on it as well (including toxic shot). Other than these things, I find that he'd be very useful again :D But downvote this if you wish (because you know, satan and all). I just really love Teemo and hope to see him relevant again.

You have to full screen, then hope for a higher resolution to show you (if they're hovering a champion.) So instead of that, can we have some sort of talley mark underneath the team name/how many kills they have? Or, make a graphic for it. But... I'm okay with tally marks (I'm not picky ^^;)Thanks for reading,A fan of watching Pro League

So I watch the Korean and Chinese circuit. It's not the same though, they have no face cams ;-;)Anyways, back on track, why not have a light, lime green-like color on the mini-map, to show the vision of wards? It's so when someone places one down and they're next to it, you can see that overlay, and the clear color can still be for the champs/players and stuff.I'unno if I worded my idea out properly, but I hope you guys understand it. I'm not well at photoshop or anything, so I can't just loledit and picture and let perceive what I do. If you make it this far, thanks for reading and I'd appreciate a positive response.

This season, I go 8 - 2, and get placed in Silver 1. Cool, that's great! I'm happy with that. But then the next... several games... don't go-- As of current I am now 12 - 13. TWELVE WINS. THIRTEEN LOSSES. WHAT DO I DO? This is literally how every game of ranked I play go:* My lane either goes even, or I win (I always play fill because I am comfortable with each position. I want everyone to play their best position possible.)* Jungler doesn't make too big of an impact, being a jungler* other two lanes either go even or lose, doesn't matter.* Mid game we catch them out and begin to set up plays, good calls everyo-- WAIT WHAT'S THAT? FILE ONE BY ONE AND GO IN AND DIE TO THEIR CARRY?    I'm just so frustrated in this game style. I literally do not know what to do in order to carry myself out of this position. Duo queueing does not help me. There's still 3 morons on my team just waiting to throw themselves at the enemy's carry and feed them. Reddit, please help me :(

365g0a	-13449	1431766953	leagueoflegends	Doron's Shield	In the current state of the shield, it has very little use. Top laners will start ring and blade over shield mainly because it offers nothing. Blade gives life steal, attack damage, and only 10 less health than shield. Ring has 20 less health, but 3 mana regen per second, and restores 4 mana upon last hit. So to go along with the era of tanks, why not add resistances such as like... I'unno, 10 armor and 10 magic resist on Doran's Shield? It was made for sustain, as it's unique passive lets you take 8 less damage.Tl;dr: Doran's Shield offers very little to Doran's Blade and Ring. Give it 10 MR + Armor with it to make it another item people can start with. EDIT: Put an 'o' instead of an 'a'. Rip me.

So if you play 2 games (if ARAM/Dominion, that's roughly 40 - 1 hour together), that'll total up to 100 points! 1 hour, 100 points from just 100 people alone? We're 1/350,000!So, we know that as a player base, there's more than 100 people in our region, (Idk how many are specifically in EU/NA, idk how to check either.) So, let's assume there's roughly 10 million people (Yay our 100 people had 100k babies!), that's now 1 million pre-made 5 v 5 games, making 5 million points in roughly 30 - 40 minutes!

1i3icq	-13452	1373567326	audioengineering	Need help with a DIY project to deal with ambient white noise	I have just moved houses, and am now producing out of my new basement. **However** there is a large fan which is quite close that is making a substantial amount of noise (at approx. speaking volume) that's saturating quite a range of frequencies... **I'm looking for some opinions on a method to deal with this, that has to be relatively cost effective and collapsable with minimal disposable componants.** Any input would be greatly appreciated.I have a few ideas: the first of which would be to enclose the fan, although it is connected to ductwork, which may cause an issue with full air-tight enclosure; I'm also concerned about restricting airflow, and turning the fan off is not an option. If it is not an issue, the fan is close to a wall, and could be conveniently enclosed.My second method takes two forms: either I enclose my entire working environment, or enclose a small booth to record vocals free of ambient noise. The solution has to be relatively cheap, and I am willing to improvise, or otherwise fabricate the necessary materials in order to make this happen.**Any functional knowledge of material dissipation of sound frequencies would be greatly appreciated here**. I'm thinking the cheapest solution would be to enclose a small amount of space (5'x5' or 6'x6') in some form of vapour barrier, mounted on a frame (material unspecified), with some form of flange at the base and ceiling with additional caulking to ensure it's air-tight. I gave some consideration for dissipation, and thought that a 2-ply solution, with two sheets mounted a few inches apart might further remove ambient noise. So does reddit  have any thoughts or ideas?

I thought it was just a simple toggle, but no... This shit just *had* to fuck things up for me.Getting out of high contrast mode is usually not very hard - You simply choose a theme with the basic Aero settings, like "Windows 7". My problem is that I've been using a theme called [Clearscreen Sharp ](http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs37/i/2009/305/0/6/Clearscreen_Sharp_for_Windows7_by_K_Johnson.png) (which is SO much nicer than the basic themes), and the recently activated high contrast mode just won't leave that theme alone. I've tried switching from it to Windows 7 and back to Clearscreen Sharp again, but the high contrast is still there and I can't find a way of getting rid of it. Please help me get my style back! :(**EDIT:**Also. the "Fönsterfärg"-link in the first image doesn't seem to be helpful at all. I can only customize certain colors, font sizes and such settings.

If I drop an image in the Uploads folder it will automatically be pushed into the My Photo Stream folder and therefore it will be available on my iPhone and iPad as well.The content of the Uploads folder seem to be useless after it's been synched to the My Photo Stream folder, so I just emptied it after it was done doing so. But how do I remove photos from the stream? Deleting them from My Photo Stream takes it away from my PC, of course, but they are still available on my iPhone and iPad. As far as I see there's also no way to remove them from those units.

What it's made me realize though is that I'm usually not even present!This morning just before I woke up I dreamed of a few kids from high school playing in a band. Then one of them left in a car with her mother and it all turned into a cartoon. Her mother even looked like Anastasia in the animated movie with the same name. I saw it happening from camera angles, as if I was no-clipping through the sky. So how am I supposed to realize I'm in a dream if I feel as if I don't even have a body?
1j1r54	-13453	1374781552	wiiu	My first impressions of Pikmin 3	Mild gameplay spoilers. Nothing too bad, I promise!I got mine in the mail a day early! Last night I recieved a text message saying a package from Hemmakväll AB has been delivered... And what do you know, it arrived this morning. Finally something to play on the Wii U! I've been waiting to pick something up (Pikmins?) since I finished Assassin's Creed 3 back in January. I didn't know a whole lot about Pikmin 3 (other than the  new types of Pikmin), so I was very excited to finally have it. Here are a few of my thoughts so far.First of all, it looks gorgeous in motion. I've seen screenshots where a few textures looked plain and boring, but there are so many details around that I forgot about small things like that. It was only a matter of time until I was swept into the gameplay and enjoyed myself. I really like the blur in the distance that makes you want to explore a bit further. Speaking of exploring - The map on the gamepad is fantastic. Sometimes I feel like I can walk around the level and completely rely on it alone. You can scroll around the map by touch and set a point to "Go to!" without having to navigate there yourself.Having several playable characters is fun and opens up many new strategies and puzzles. The different voices of the characters are neat too, very Animal Crossing like, and some words such as Captain and Pikmin pass through the gibberish.The one thing I don't like at all so far is how hypersensetive the reticle is. It's been ages since I played Pikmin but I can't remember it being this hard to control in any of the two predecessors. I don't feel like I've needed great precision so far but something tells me I will. On the other hand I might have gotten used to it at that point.Very satisfied with my first 8 days and still feel like I haven't done a thing. I can't wait to explore the shit out of this game.

23kbh0	-13466	1398051743	atheism	Help me put the logical smackdown on a minister from my mother's church	So I had just assumed that it would never come to this, but my mother now knows that I doubt Christianity. She doesn't know I'm an atheist and that I have already questioned and researched and had epiphanies. I was planning to just keep my head down until after I got out of college because my family is so religious. They wouldn't cut me off, but the fear of them doing something to control me is still there. Going to church on holidays and not talking about it seemed pretty easy in theory, but this Easter Sunday I just couldn't help myself. I asked the minister how eternal punishment was fair for anyone. Long story short, I'll be corresponding with him through email, asking questions until I get satisfactory answers (or not.)Surprisingly, my mother is all for it. I told her that if I was going to believe in something, it had to be the truth, and stand up to scrutiny. She got a bit arrogant about it in front of the minister and other congregation members, basically saying that there's no way I don't come out of this a "stronger christian". When we got home though, she got upset told my grandmother she was worried that I would "turn away from god".The wisest man I know (my papaw, my mother's father) an the only truly good christian I've ever met, told me that I should be honest about my beliefs no matter which way they go. Even if it hurts my family, that they love me no matter what, but if I'm an atheist to not bring it up around mom. He said she can live with knowing it if she doesn't have to think about it, so I should just be as diplomatic as possible.I still have to put on a good show, because the minister will probably tell my mom about most of it. I need the best arguments, questions, contradictions, moral dilemmas, etc. tho throw at him. Preferably based on the bible itself (not very hard I know). TL;DRI need the best things you've got to stump a christian apologist. I have a crap ton of science stuff already, give me biblically based arguments against Yahweh and Zombie Jeebus. Pretty please with BBQ'd babies on top?

25lfng	-13466	1400122260	atheism	Another bad coming-out story, I should have read the FAQ.	I just got back from my first year at college, and I somehow knew this would happen. I couldn't keep my big mouth shut, now I might have caused irreparable damage to my familial relationships. I won't be homeless though, my parents are divorced and my father accepts me for who I am. In fact, he's likeminded. Currently though, I live with my mother (2 states away, close to Cinci.) I go to school in about 3 hours away (close to Toledo), so I lived in a dorm and got spoiled by the freedom and autonomy. The only thing she has any real control over is my car, she doesn't pay for anything else. My Papaw (her father) pays for my tuition though. Since her first reaction is to blame anyone but me (her favorite demon is the "liberal college conspiracy") I'm worried that she'll try to convince him to divert that funding towards only christian college or some shit. Honestly I have no idea if he would cave or ignore her drama, because he's truly the only good christian I know. I love him and look up to him because he isn't a hypocrite, and he told me that being honest but diplomatic is the best course of action. I had all these grand plans of re-enacting the gradual process I went through so they could see it, then telling them when I'm completely independent. I fucked that plan up royally when I ran my big fat ass mouth during a heated argument about gay rights (which my mother doesn't believe exist.) My dad is more than willing to support me, but it would be a financial burden that he shouldn't have to undertake. He already pays for most of my shit, and my job is minimum wage which doesn't help much at all. Also, a large portion of my life is here. My SO of 5 years, many of my friends, I don't want to uproot and move 2 states away because my mom is throwing the biggest sulking-pity party-depressed-angry-emotionally blackmailing-hissyfit-tantrum that the world has ever seen. I doubt that they will actually kick me out, something similar happened with another family member who came out as gay (years before I was born) and he cut off all contact until the day he died. They all regret what happened then, so I doubt they'll go down that road. I'm still very upset though, I don't want to lose half of my family over this. It really hurts that their love seems conditional, as I mentioned before the emotional blackmail is pervasive. My mother was so upset that she cried all day today, and I'm actually worried she might do something drastic/horrible, like suicide. I'm mostly just venting here, but any advice is welcome.TL;DR I accidentally outed myself, and I needed to vent. If you do have any advice I'm happy to read it. I won't be homeless because I have one non-judgmental parent (divorced, different states), but leaving is a shitty option. 
271it9	-13466	1401643469	childfree	Help and insight?	(TL:DR at the bottom)I've been lurking around here for a while now, and I have to say I'm conflicted. I really don't know whether I want children or not. The important thing for me is to thoroughly question everything, and to have a good set of reasons for whichever choice I make. I've got plenty of time to decide (F/20), but it's been bothering me. I'd be very grateful if you could share with me some of your reasons for being childfree, and anything else you feel might be relevant.One of the most common reasons I hear is that it will fuck up my career with maternity leave, but that won't really be an issue for me. I'm going to be a high school science teacher, and I wouldn't accept any promotions to higher paying administrative positions anyway. Plus, I could probably time pregnancies so that the births are during summer break. I love my subject to death, and I feel that I would do more good to society as a teacher than as an administrator. (especially with science!;) My loving partner of 5 years is going into the field of computers, and will likely be a house husband because most of what he does can be accomplished remotely. So we could both easily have careers without being affected negatively. Even though we are very young and certainly not planning on having children anytime soon, it's something we've talked about in great depth. We're both unsure at this point.We have probably discussed it more than we would have normally because last year I had an ovarian tumor. It was cystic and benign, but one of my ovaries had to be removed and fertility came into question. I should be able to have biological children, but I'm not sure if I want to pass on these genes (my lady parts problems are heritable). I've also heard that adopting is ridiculously expensive, which is unfortunate because I like the idea of adopting as much or more than biokids.I also like the idea of raising a couple of kids to be responsible adults that are of use to society, but I'm not sure if I would be able to. It scares me that I could fail, and I'm also worried that I only like the idea of it because I've been conditioned to. I would want the best for them, organic food, quality education, instilling a love of history, science, and art. I would think of them as their own people rather than as an extension of myself. I don't know if I could provide all of the parenting and resources necessary to form a decent human being, but I like the idea of contributing to the world positively in that way.TL:DR I'm conflicted and wondering about whether or not I should be childfree, I'd just like some insight and good questions to help me in my decision.
29c7cb	-13466	1403982140	atheism	Everyone, meet my mom.	So a little background: My parents divorced and my mom coped by becoming addicted to religion and food. She weighs about 380 pounds and of course has health problems as a result. She has been using the "power of prayer" to be healthy. Whenever I tell her that the human body is not meant to carry that much weight and to cut back on the processed foods and sheer amount of calories, she tells me "it's in god's hands and he'll keep me healthy"Today she came into the den complaining about how her favorite chair is of poor quality because it broke when she sat in it. She said it must be because "the gays" don't know how to build things because god isn't taking care of them. (She apparently bought it from a gay guy who makes beautiful furniture)-Then I'm just sitting there like. ಠ-ಠ   Tl:Dr my mom tried to pray the fat away, when it didn't work it was somehow the fault of homosexuals.BTW: This is the same woman who cried when the news announced that gay marriage was legal in another state.
2mjgbb	-13466	1416207700	bdsm	Seeking advice, new to bdsm	My lover and I have been in a wonderful, committed relationship for more than six years. We're still open to change in our relationship and sex life. (We tried anal for the first time a while back, and it went splendidly)I have had some submissive fantasies for a while, but I didn't tell him for the longest time. I was afraid he wouldn't want to do it. I also had mixed feelings about it myself which I had to come to terms with. My father came from a household of abuse and he had taught me from a young age that I should NEVER let a man hit me, and basically raised me to be a feminist. It took me a while to understand my own feelings and desires. Eventually I learned and realized the real meaning of consent, and how willingly submitting is very different from being a battered woman.Once I got the courage to tell my mate, I was very sure of what I wanted and I expressed it to him the best way I could. The problem is that he's a very sweet person (vegetarian, pacifist, etc.), and he doesn't really know how to dominate me. The prospect of kink does excite him, and he is willing to try pretty much anything. He doesn't really know where to start, and I don't know where to find resources that describe what I really want. I don't know how to teach him to do what I want.To give you some idea, what I want is pretty vanilla. Hair pulling, spanking (with hands or light, stingy implements), being tied up with soft things (silk ribbons, leather shackles), rough sex, and being called a dirty slut or similar things. I don't really like intense pain, but I love being submissive. Even with a detailed description like this, it doesn't explain the finer points of how I want to be talked to, or what a Dom really is, or the proper way to bind me. He really wants to satisfy even my darkest urges (which are not really very dark at all), but I can't adequately describe these things without some kind of reference. I would be grateful for any advice/resources you more experienced persons can provide.
2vdvyz	-13466	1423543679	fatpeoplestories	Tales of the WhaleMom: Prologue Part I, (My Fat2Fit)	Hello all! I am AKillerCuttlefish, former fatty. This is my story.I am a whopping 5 foot 1, currently oscillate around 100-110 pounds (depends on season and whatnot) and wear about a size 2 (US) Which is about 155 cm tall, and a little over 7 stone, or 45-50 kilograms. I also have a tiny bone structure.  A not so long time ago, in the very galaxy in which we reside, lived a ham. This ham at her heaviest was 170 pounds (12 stone, or 77 kilos) and wore size 14 stretch pants. She gorged herself on chocolate, chips, and whatever else she pleased. That fatass was me.  There is much background to be told before one may fully understand the origin of my adipose. This Fat2Fit takes place throughout the past 7 or so years, condensed to the good bits. It starts at my Junior high years and ends around my first year at college. I grew up in a house of ham, which brings me to the cast of my upcoming saga  Maybe be me, Killer. At the time range of this story, an ever- expanding butterball who had a huge health scare that shocked some sense into me. Also this turkey has goth flavoring for the first few years of this tale (doesn’t come into play much yet, just roll with it).  Always be my boo, whom I shall call Placid. I’m a volcano and he is my peaceful lake. Not even kidding. I’m outspoken *cough cough, obnoxious! cough*, and I wear my lady balls on the outside. He is tranquil and gentle, a pacifist, and a vegetarian. (we both are vegetarians, actually) We’ve been together for about 6 years now. How he put up with my shit for so long, I will never know.  Don’t be GramHam, my mother’s mother’s mother. She isn’t terribly hammy, but she is on the large side. She’s what I call old-fat, where a decent portion of the weight is comprised of saggy crepey skin. I say don’t be her because my great grandmother is not only a product of her time, but can be a real ass about it. She refers to African Americans as ‘Negroes’, is incredibly homophobic, and anyone who disagrees with any of her opinions is going to hell (obviously). Also, passive- aggressive as fuck. A true southern bible thumper. She lives with us. (btw my family is southern, but I am not. They all grew up in KY, and I in OH)  Don’t be MeeMawHam either, around 5’ 6” and over 280. Has already had at least one heart attack, several stents, is diabetic, has serious mental issues (like auditory hallucinations and paranoid delusions) and still won’t take her meds or put down her damned KFC. Almost as much of a narcissist as her mother (GramHam), which led to her daughter (my mother) also being fucked up.  If you value your life, probably don’t be Grandpops, the long suffering husband of MeeMawHam, my maternal grandfather. He is pretty slim, his job keeps him fit. He is an average man with the patience of a saint, perpetually fetching snacks and working himself to the bone to keep MeeMawHam well funded (she’s a big spender, you see. Not just on food, but on purses and shit like that. She’s actually very stylish.) I consider him a good man, despite the fact that we have different worldviews. He is also a product of the time and place in which he was born but he is not an ass about it. In fact, he barely talks at all, let alone about his beliefs. He has said to me before that ultimately what others do is their business. I wish there were more people like Grandpops.  Be BorgDad, if you wish. My father has steadily become a better person over the years, as have I. He is also working very hard to rid himself of his spare tire. I tend to take after him. His name originates in the fact that if he could be a cyborg, he would absolutely go for it. He’s a blind, badass, computer nerd, who loves technology. He and my mother divorced when I was in junior high school, you’ll soon understand why in the chronicles to come.  And for the love of all that is holy and made of swiss, do not be my mother. DO NOT be WhaleMom. 5’8” and almost 400 pounds of fatlogic and religious fundamentalism. There is such a thing as big boned, there is also just being really fat, my mother is both. She is also the only ham in the family with poor hygiene. I can’t even live with her anymore because her house is so filthy. (Our house is actually two houses on the same property. An apartment above a garage where my mother resides, and a larger house Where GramHam and I live. This is also where MeeMawHam and Grandpops stay when they visit, which is most every weekend)  &gt;I’m starting with how I escaped the realm of Whalemom’s fatlogic and became the shitlord I am today, then I will transition into specific tales of her landwhalery. Now, on to our buttery tale;  Up until puberty I was a skinny kid. I got a lot of exercise and didn’t have the attention span to sit down and eat for hours on end. Then when I got to middle school everything changed. I started to get bullied by other girls because of my new budded bosoms, by 5th grade I was a 32C and there was some serious jealousy from the A cup crowd.Ever the helpful person, my dear mother introduced me to the practice of eating your feelings. And I did. By the pound. I would mostly eat while watching TV. My particular favorite things were chips ‘n’ dip. Thin, crispy, ruffled slices of deep fried potato smothered in fatty, french onion flavored sour cream, and all the sci- fi I could watch. What could be better? This would have been less of a problem if recess hadn’t been taken away from me, but alas, I had no easy way to burn away the extra calories.In addition to my waistline, my brain also became fattified. WhaleMom is a big HAES supporter, and a self proclaimed fat activist. I parroted her beliefs for a very long time because I trusted her and thought she was smart. Here’s the hard part, WhaleMom is actually very booksmart. Her knowledge of history and culture is extensive, and I admire her for that. Unfortunately, up until my late teens I never bothered to fact-check her ON ANYTHING. This included a lot of her political and religious views as well.This was all fine for my history papers and school projects, not so much for my social skills. I alienated a lot of people with my obnoxiousness and fat logic. I of course believed it was muh genetics because hey, my mom is fat, and GramHam… and MeeMawHam… and the ladies on my father’s side of the family weren’t exactly slim either. I even considered myself somewhat attractive (I was a butterbody in every sense of the term), I had a loving boyfriend and I carried my weight pretty well (for a cow). I maintain a belief to this day that, if I had not become ill, I would still be that disgusting person.	In my senior year of high school I began expanding at a prodigious rate, but only in my abdomen. At first I thought pregnancy may be the cause, but I was still being visited by Aunt Flow on the regular and every test said NOT PREGNANT. Nevermind the fact that Placid and I were careful to the point of paranoia. The expansion was really concerning because I had leveled out to a size 14 and didn’t understand why I kept getting bigger. I wasn’t eating more or exercising less, in fact I was legitimately eating far less. I hardly ever had breakfast, picked at my lunch, and ate maybe half of my dinner. I was also becoming incredibly fatigued. From the second I got home from school until I had to go to school the next day, I would sleep. I also strained a muscle in my back, and had a hard time carrying my books. My Placid, bless him, took that burden for a while and carried them for me. He also put up with my nearly constant tears, need for reassurance/validation, and mood swings.	I didn’t want to think I was sick, despite all that. I refused to go to the doctor because we had no health insurance, and finances were tight. Another reason I didn’t want to go is because of WhaleMom. See, she has a severe anxiety disorder which she refuses to treat. Her constant fear is that everyone is sick, that I have cancer, or the dog has cancer. That is one of her constant and unreasonable fears. I am ridiculously accommodating and tread on eggshells around her when it comes to illness because if I say I need to go to the doctor, she has a breakdown. Her problems in that arena would be easily fixed with therapy and medication, but she refuses to even try. Despite her many flaws, she does love me dearly and would be devastated if I was sick. So I operated on the principle that if no doctor actually said it out loud, it wasn’t real and WhaleMom wouldn’t have to cry over me.Eventually I got to the breaking point, after the frequent vomiting started. I wasn’t able to eat or drink more than maybe a handful or two at a time without throwing it all up. Long story short, we found out that my right ovary had grown a fluid-filled tumor, roughly the size of a basketball.To Be Continued...TL;DR, I have a WhaleMom who taught me to be a fatty. Then I got a tumor.(edited for formatting and butter-bodies)

Former goth-fatty, now more extraverted than obnoxious. Currently a size 2, very petite at 5’1” and about 100 pounds or so.Always be Placid. I’m a volcano and he is my peaceful lake. A gentle and strong person I’ve loved for 6 years now. How he put up with my shit for so long, I will never know.Don’t be GramHam, my mother’s mother’s mother. 92 years old and on the larger side.

She is both.Also introducing two new characters, my aunts (BorgDad’s sisters)Maybe be Fruitcake, who is one year older than BorgDad. So named because this side of the family has more flakes, fruits, and nuts than breakfast cereal. She has led an interesting life to say the least, but has matured a lot over the years and has settled down considerably since her wild youth.Probably don’t be BadLifeDecisions or BDL for short. The baby of the family who never really grew up. Most of her youthful indiscretions were permanent, namely the smoking like a freight train and having more children than she can afford.  Also don’t be BDL’s husband MethMouth. That name should be more than self-explanatory.&gt;So the story left off with the diagnoses of a tumor growing from my treacherous lady testicle...I had gone to the doctor with Grandpops, because the pain from the vomiting and strained back left me unable to drive. (WhaleMom was at work, MeemawHam rarely drives, and GramHam has glaucoma so thank christ she doesn’t drive). My surgeon would later remark that it was incredible I had managed to get as far as I did, given how heavy and draining the tumor was. Most people would have caved long before, but I am too stubborn for my own good. Literally.I was absolutely terrified to tell everybody else. Grandpops is the strongest of all of us and he was visibly shaken. Not really surprising when one finds out that their beloved only granddaughter has a tumor. Not only that, but we had no way of knowing for sure if it was cancerous until they did a biopsy during my surgery. I was in shock for a good 15 minutes, but when that passed I could not stop crying. I was so scared that the news would make WhaleMom go as batshit crazy as MeemawHam, and it would give MeemawHam another heart attack, and GramHam would just keel over right there on the spot.They took it surprisingly well, for once they were the picture of calm-during-a-crisis. This is *incredible* to me even today. Normally the three of them consider the smallest things to be cataclysmic, and their only volume settings are loud and **louder**. GramHam called her church’s phone tree and got connected with the minister. They really wanted to have him pray over me. As an atheist it did nothing for me, but I knew it would make the rest of the family feel a lot better so I let it happen.At some point during the aftermath of the diagnosis I went upstairs and called BorgDad, still crying of course. He enlisted BLD and Fruitcake to drive up from Kentucky shortly before my surgery. We were all cramped in the one house together and I was not only bound to the first floor, but also partially bedridden. It was really nice to be surrounded by people who love me enough to not fight with each other no matter how much they want to. The divorce was very bad to say the least. WhaleMom pretty much thinks of BorgDad as the devil incarnate because he left her instead of putting up with all her bullshit. Naturally GramHam and MeemawHam took her side and hate him with a passion. Fruitcake and BLD were also the subject of their bad-mouthing. BorgDad’s side of the family was not fond of the Hamily’s hypocritical waxings at all, either. But in the weeks surrounding my surgery and recovery, they never fought in front of me. There were some tense moments, but they successfully put aside their feud for me. That probably helped me the most.BorgDad and I watched TV together, Fruitcake and BDL hugged me and offered supportive words, GramHam did her church thing, MeemawHam bought me clothes that I would be more comfortable in, MomWhale made my meals, Grandpops was a rock for us all, Placid stood by me and held me when I blubbered about the possibility of losing my hair to chemo, even MethMouth did his best to cheer me up with jokes. I got cards and flowers from classmates and family, Placid’s family sent me things too. Even my assistant principal pitched in well wishes and made sure the teachers excused me from any work for the whole time I was recovering.During my recovery the report on the biopsy came back and relief washed over us all. It wasn’t cancer. Never a fairy tale ending for me though, there was a pretty big caveat. The cells were benign, but not “normal” either. There’s a chance of recurrence, so every six months I have to get checked for it. If it does come back I’ll be screwed out of ever getting pregnant to have kids because there is only one ovary left for the tumors to grow on.That doesn’t really bother me though, because without the tumor I would still be a mini moon. The worst thing for me was feeling like I had no control. I had to trust the outcome to strangers. Highly trained and competent strangers, but strangers nonetheless. I wasn’t going to stand for any more of that than I had to, so I asked my doctors what I could do to reduce my risk. The first thing was treating the PCOS that caused the damned thing in the first place. That was taken care of with medication. Easy. The only other thing they recommended to me was to lose my excess weight, eat healthy, and get in shape.Before the surgery I was 170 pounds. The 4 liters of cystic fluid they drained off accounted for about 30 pounds. So after my incision closed up and I was deemed fit to begin my exercise, I was around 140. That was in spring of 2012. Through hard work I pushed through and dropped 40 pounds by the following spring. This was made harder by the fact that WhaleMom resented the crap out of this weight loss and was thoroughly convinced I had an eating disorder. (I didn’t and still don’t).So here I stand before you, a fully formed shitlord ready to feed you the beetus-y tales of my childhood, assisted by BorgDad in the areas I was not privy to at the time. Let me know if you want MOAR.TL;DR Getting a tumor scared the fat out of me. I am now fit and healthy, all thanks to a despicable mass of indiscriminately over-replicating cells.

Former goth-fatty, current shitlord  Always be Placid, my beleaguered better half  Don’t be GramHam, my racist, homophobic, passive- aggressive great grandma.  Don’t be MeeMawHam either. Has heart problems, the beetus, is batshit crazy, narcissistic, and frequently refuses her meds.   If you value your life, don’t be Grandpops, long suffering husband of MeeMawHam  Be BorgDad, if you wish. Wannabe cyborg and my father. He spent 16 years putting up with the Hamily before he cracked.  And whatever you do, DO NOT be WhaleMom. 400 pounds of fatlogic, religious fundamentalism, and poor hygiene.  &gt;MOAR BEETUS AHOY! Adipose on the starboard bow! Wait, that’s not an aquatic mammal, it’s my mother!   So I called up BorgDad the other day to talk and the subject of WhaleMom waddled its way into the conversation. I needed to vent about one of our latest fights and while I did, a thought occurred. See, I was venting about how she broke my favorite chair. Then BorgDad mentioned the custom welded, reinforced steel bedframe he had commissioned before the divorce. I started thinking about all the money our family has spent on repairs, replacements and super-heavy-duty everything.  BorgDad and I decided to compile a complete list of all the things WhaleMom has ever broken with her tremendous self. Needless to say, It was long. Here is just a sample:  4 couches  2 beds  Every tile on the bathroom floor  The laundry room floor  Innumerable chairs  10+ toilet seats  2 toilets (cracked the porcelain)  A whole shower (she slipped and the wall was the one who got injured)  3 expensive recliners  13 solid oak stair treads (they cracked/split longways in the center)  At least one table  One of the cats she sat on (didn’t really break her, but she was pissed for months and I have the scratch scars to prove)  &gt;I could continue but it would need its own post, you get the idea I have the opinion that being willfully, morbidly obese and making no effort to change is selfish. You are slowly killing yourself and making your loved ones watch your agonizing, disgusting, slow-motion death. The other day I realized that it is also fiscally irresponsible.   We all have stories of Hams sticking other people with the bill, spending rent money on McBeetus, and other similar things, but the cost of bulk food is nothing compared to the immense amount of money wasted on the repairs needed after the tidal wave of fat destroys your house!  I had one of my friends who majors in actuarial sciences (accounting type stuff) help me do the math based on a sample yearly budget. I was astounded. We figured out that the amount of money wasted on obesity in this case would have been enough to pay off **all** of my student loan debt. ALL OF IT! I go to a moderately priced, public, 4-year type of institution and I have worked my arse off to be here.   I am still pretty pissed about this. I’m doing (minimum) 18 credits a semester, working as an RA, applying for all the grants/scholarships, signing away my soul (TEACH grant, see footnote), and doing distance summer courses to finish college as quickly and cheaply as possible. It’s hell, but I do it because we’re poor (so I thought) and my single mother can’t spare the extra money to put me through higher education.  I was wrong. If I keep doing the RA thing and gettin’ mad stacks for my academic prowess, the remaining bill would be paid for with about three years worth of Ham-wasted money. Also, our calculations (incredible as they may be) *still* don’t account for all the Beetus-bucks. Even more Fat- cash is being pissed away because of clothing.   The ~~circus tents~~ clothes my mom wears cost a lot more than regular clothing. She isn’t one of the super trashy hamplanets who squeezes into clothing that is too small, she knows better than that. WhaleMom has an office job that requires business casual dress so she gets a lot of her clothes from a place that caters to nicer coverings for her gravitational pull- inducing mass. MeemawHam usually picks out Whalemom’s clothing because she has a good sense of style, very classic in its aesthetic. Oh and when I say “she gets” what I mean is, “Grandpops pays for”.   I love Grandpops dearly, but he is an enabler. He also paid most of my medical bills and buys my books for college. He pays for things, does repairs and cleans the house, cooks, waits on MeemawHam hand and foot, and basically never stops working. This is because his main method of demonstrating love is by doing for others. WhaleMom takes advantage of that. Not with malice, mind you. She often laments not being able to pay for her own clothing and feels guilty about how much it costs. However, MeemawHam and Grandpops insist (mainly MeemawHam)  Let’s talk about MeemawHam for just a second, because it will provide context. She is simultaneously one of the most selfish and most generous people I know. Money is literally no object to her, whether she’s buying for herself or others. She will insist upon buying high quality ~~tents~~ clothes for WhaleMom because she wants her to have nice things, and loves shopping. Going shopping is MeemawHam’s favorite activity, and she just loves being wheeled around. Oh, did I mention the *wheelchair*? Yeah, she doesn’t need it at all. She is perfectly capable of walking, but forces my 69 year old Grandpops to push her fat ass around the mall. The chair goes with them everywhere, it has a happy home in the trunk of their car. When I’m not around to help, Grandpops has to haul that chair in and out of the trunk (it weighs about 40 pounds but feels like more because of the bulk).   &gt;At least it’s better than a scooter, right? /sOn that note, she is incredibly self-centered, and lazy. She has convinced herself that her doctor advised against her exercising (actually the exact opposite) and don’t even bother trying to correct her because it won’t change a thing. She basically sits in a recliner all day and makes Grandpops fetch her food and drinks. She doesn’t even say please or thank you most of the time. She justifies this with what she legitimately believes was her doctor’s advice. What I’m describing here is what we would call a good day. She’s pretty much herself and is in a good mood. This is where her mental illness rears its ugly head in the form of delusions and bi-polar mood swings (toss in a dash of schizophrenic paranoia, too).  On a bad day she screams at people who aren’t there (voices in her head) and accuses us of trying to poison/murder her. Sometimes a bad day can be induced by saying the wrong thing. This is why she gets away with all her shit. If you argue with her and put her in a bad mood, she’ll start hallucinating and be a giant pain in the ass for the following week. Besides being major inconvenience, it brings a lot of emotional pain as well. That is what the face of this particular psychosis is, it looks like Meemaw, sounds like her, walks like her, but isn’t her. She screams and curses and says terrible/hurtful things, sometimes she just sits there with her fingers in her ears talking to herself.   Sometimes we can get a laugh at her delusions, particularly the one where she is sure that Grandpops has a bunch of secret other families with other women. Our response is usually, “When would he have the time? He never stops dealing with you!” This is small consolation though, most of the time it’s just disturbing and emotionally painful. My usual coping method is to run away to Placid’s place until her crazy episode is over.  It’s almost like she dies and comes back on a frequent basis (Maybe she’s secretly a Winchester?). We lose her, but she comes back and is herself again. There is always the fear that this time is for good and we won’t ever get her back. I think that is why we enable her so much. It’s infuriating and sad to watch her slow motion fat-death, but it’s worse to see the death of her mind in a body that still walks and talks.  TL;DR Obesity is very expensive, and having a family member with mental illness is painful  *footnote*; the TEACH grant is a program that forgives the loans of education majors if they agree to serve 4 years in an area of need.

2xra4y	-13466	1425360125	fatpeoplestories	Tales of the WhaleMom II: WhaleMom eats a Restaurant	Hello All! So I’m going to tell you about the time WhaleMom almost ate the Chinese buffet restaurant out of business.&gt;You have achieved Faithful Reader Badge! New Character Unlocked!be my unfortunate friend TorturedWaitress, or just Tortured for short. Pretty blonde girl who happens to speak Japanese because her of mom (We’ll call her TigerMama because of her full back tattoo. She plays a minor part in this story). TigerMama married Tortured’s dad when she was a baby and adopted her, raised her up right in a bilingual home. Some of my insider details came from Tortured when she worked at the restaurant in question, which my mom consumed with the energy of a dying star.WhaleMom and I come from a tiny town adjacent to the suburbs of a major metropolitan area. This means that within a 15 minute drive we have all the stores we could wish for. There are box stores, department stores, one mall, and several grocery-type institutions including my beloved organic granola and tofu dispensary (rhymes with Mole Moods, and WhaleMom avoids it like the plague.) There are also a large number of restaurants, some of which are ~~Ham feeding troughs~~ all-you-can-eat buffets.One in particular is the kind of place where they take 10 different kinds of Asian, blend it all together and barf it back out into a feeding establishment for culturally oblivious Americans. To give you some idea, one of the buffet aisles had sushi, pho, kimchi, lo mein, and curry all right next to the green tea ice cream machine. Which is all fine and well and good, until people mix all that tasty stuff together into ridiculous plate slop. I once saw a random ham at this place who was dunking ghee soaked naan into his egg drop soup, and mixing fried pork and a cut-up azuki filled bun into some kind of tikka. *shudder and cringe*The place called itself The {removed for privacy} Chinese Buffet  (despite most of the staff being Japanese), but Tortured and I called it the FatDragon Buffet because of all the landwhales. Tortured worked as a hostess/waitress there, TigerMama’s cousin ran it and helped her get the job. She was basically a shoe-in though, because the owner wanted a white girl at the front so entitled/racist AmeriHams would have less to complain/harass the staff about (Sad truth, it worked. There were fewer incidents and complaints after Tortured got hired). The fact that she fluently spoke the first language of the majority of the staff was just a perk.The summer after my first year at college, I decided to frequent FatDragon Buffet and bring WhaleMom with me. She’s a bit of a weeaboo, but she’s also very aware of the history, customs, and differences between various Asian cultures. As I’ve said before, she is very book smart and therefore more culturally aware than most of the hams who go to FatDragon. I knew she wouldn’t stick her chopsticks upright in her rice bowl or mix kimchi into her miso. Being culturally unaware is just one way to be rude though. There are other ways to embarrass your family and bring shame to your daughter.As WhaleMom and I prepared to leave, the ominous clouds began to gather. Thunder groaned in the distance, the wail of the brass section swelled, and somewhere in the distance my 9th grade english teacher fell to his knees and cried “FORESHADOWING!!!”&gt;Killer, I can’t fit in your car, let’s take the truck.&gt;I think Grandpops needs it to take GramHam to the eye doctor today.&gt;Just trade keys and let him use yours.My car is a compact sedan, and the seats are lower to the ground, getting into which is harder on GramHam’s arthritis. So not the best thing.&gt;You fit the last time, remember? When we went shopping for my dorm stuff.&gt;That was last year, I gained some weight after you *left us* WhaleMom used GuiltTrip! It was not very effective!&gt;Mom, I didn’t really leave. I still live here in the summer and Killer’sTopChoice University is only a few hours away.&gt;You gave me empty nest syndrome! You hardly ever called- (I called every week) &gt;-and I needed some more comfort food. I got really depressed and gained about 40 pounds because you refused to go to CrappyCommunityCollege and give me more time to adjust!*holyshit. How much comfort food results in 40 pounds of pure fat?*&gt;Let’s not talk about this, let’s just have a nice day out. Maybe we can go to SomeStore after lunch. I’ll ask Grandpops to trade keys.Killer used Dodge! It was super effective!We arrived at FatDragon, and I was warmly greeted by Tortured, who led us to the platformed tables which required an extra step. These are the best tables, right in view of the lovely and elaborate koi pond in the atrium, and close to the staff station (where you can easily flag down a waitress if your drink is empty). I was just about to thank Tortured, when my mother begins her plaintive whalesong.&gt; I have knee problems, I can’t have that extra step. Especially if I have to get up and down to fill my plate. Can you move us to a different table please? It has to be a table though, I can’t do booths.My heart sank a little. I love watching the koi, they all have names and I have grown fond of them. Tortured has sent me snapchats of them during feeding time when they do the derpy-fish-mouth thing, it’s adorable. Oh, well at least WhaleMom wasn’t too rude. At least she said ‘please’.We ended up at a table much further away, the fishies blocked from my view by a decorative divider. It wasn’t too bad though. WhaleMom and I went to fill our plates and ended up both choosing sushi (made fresh). They had a lot of vegetarian options and I was feeling it that day, so I got some sweet tofu hoso maki, some vegetable and kanpyo rolls, and a rice ball with umeboshi. I also grabbed a steamed bun for desert. It was a good bit of food (6 pieces of sushi, a rice ball bigger than my hand, and a steamed bun made to look like a peach), but it was nothing in comparison to what WhaleMom grabbed. She had about a party boat’s worth of sushi on one plate (the kind meant for a whole table, 15+pieces), several desert type things (buns, sugared donuts, etc.) on another, a bowl of noodles, and a plate of various sides. She had commandeered a waitress to help her carry it back to the table.I was shocked, because I had forgotten just how much ~~krill~~ food my mom could consume in a sitting. She usually spreads out her beetus through the course of the day. I must have been repressing a lot of meal-time memories though, because I was thoroughly flabbergasted. We ate in relative silence, until I had finished my plate and started in on my steamed bun…&gt;We should learn how to make these steamed buns mom, they’re a really good dessert. They’re not too sweet and they look really nice too.&gt;You should save your dessert for last, Killer.&gt;I did….&gt;That CAN’T be all you’re having! You’ll starve! You have to nourish your body, Killer! I’m starting to worry that you’re anorexic, you lost all that weight and now you aren’t eating like you used to.*You mean like a cow? Horking down food into my gaping maw constantly? GRAZING LIKE AN OBESE HEIFER?*&gt;Mom, I am not anorexic. Anorexics limit themselves to very few calories a day, less than 1200. I just ate at least 300, in a whole day I usually have 2000 or more. &gt;But you’re so skinny now, you can’t be eating right. You used to be curvy like me, that’s natural for you. You’re not making yourself throw up are you?&gt;You know I’m not! After I ate breakfast I spaced out on the couch for four hours watching tv and didn’t move, when would I have had the time?! And you know we don’t have the same body type! I have tiny bones, I take after dad. If anything I’m naturally smaller, when I exercise and don’t overeat. At the mention of BorgDad, Whalemom’s eyes narrowed and you could hear the locks clicking on the door of her closed mind. Whalemom refused to discuss the subject further and went back for even more food, washing it down with diet beetusjuice; which was constantly being replenished by unfortunate waitresses.With the feast finished and the buffet partially destroyed by the great adipose tsunami, we took our leave. On the way home, Whalemom informed me that FatDragon’s reasonable prices and authentic cuisine enticed her to return. She decided to make it her special place. This means she went every week. Saturday is FatDragon day! So proclaimeth the Whale!Tortured later told me of WhaleMom’s antics during FatDragon Saturday. She would come in with a book, and start reading and eating, sometimes until the book was finished. Whalemom is a fast reader, but the average text will take her at least a few hours. During these hours, she would systematically eat her way through every item available.This was a problem.FatDragon was hemorrhaging money because of Whalemom and the others of her species. So they imposed a plate limit for their regular price, and created a new price bracket (not too much higher) for unlimited plates. Tortured warned me about it on a Tuesday, so on Saturday evening I was fully prepared for the earthquake. As soon as her poor, overloaded car pulled in the drive I noped the hell out of there and went to Placid’s house. Then, because Placid’s mom is having her midlife crisis and emerging from her cocoon as a full fledged bitch, we noped out of there and went to our friend’s place. It ended up being a group of us hipster 20 somethings, hanging out being ourselves. After lots of video games and MTG set to the tune of vintage vinyl, we got hungry. What do hungry-hungry hipsters crave? Asian food. Cheap asian food. Ergo- FatDragon time. Big Mistake. As we arrived and made our way through the double doors, in the distance was an awful noise. I would recognize it anywhere. Whalesong, but not just any whalesong- oh no. It was MomWhalesong. See, WhaleMom had migrated back to FatDragon in order to whinge about the price change. And who ended up being the interpreter of the garbled bellows? None other than our dear TourturedWaitress. WhaleMom was being rude, demanding, and Tortured was on the verge of tears. A flaming dragon of righteous anger thirsting for justice reared its menacing head, roaring in both embarrassment and rage. The wrathful beast took over and I did something I had not done since 10th grade when I got my extra ear piercings.Killer used Rebellion! It was Super Effective!I called out my own dear mother in front of all my friends, the manager, the assistant manager, Tortured, an assortment of other employees, and some other customers who just happened to be within earshot.&gt;MOTHER! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?WhaleMom is too shocked to respond-&gt;How could you treat Tortured that way!? She’s my friend, and even if she wasn’t she’s still a human being. She deserves respect, and you are being exceedingly rude. You should know better than that, YOU taught ME manners, remember?!&gt;They changed the price for all you can eat! It’s blatantly discriminatory towards larger people, and-&gt;That is total crap and you know it. More volume means a greater price, and they have to make a living somehow. It’s not your restaurant, so you don’t get to decide what the prices are. If you don’t like it, LEAVE. At this point, half of the restaurant was now on the edge of their seats watching all of this unfold (probably because I was being a little louder than was absolutely necessary).WhaleMom did leave, bellowing more whalesong the whole way out, mostly things along the lines of, “won’t come back”, “bad review”, “you lost a customer”. The things directed at me were “ungrateful child”, “inconsiderate”, “where did I fail as a parent” etc.The good thing about WhaleMom is that she forgets this kind of shit the very next day, it’s like fights we had never even happened. So that was the end of it. I personally apologized to Tortured and the rest of the staff, and we enjoyed the spoils of battle. In this case the spoils of battle happened to be delicious spicy noodles.TL;DR Mom eats a restaurant, calls me anorexic for not doing the same, and I become a champion of the food service people when I call her out on her rudeness. Then we all gallop into the sunset on our ferocious battle-unicorns, slaying our enemies as we ride.edited for format/spelling
34bjl1	-13466	1430341138	fatpeoplestories	A quick tale of Blubba	I'm not sure why, but something prompted a memory to come to the surface that I had long repressed. It is a tale of beetus and sadness.My friends and I were all around 14 at the time, and super nerdy. It was Halloween and this was to be our last year trick-or-treating, so we went all out. I'll admit we were probably too old, but we weren't little assholes. If anyone turned us away, we didn't bitch. Most didn't because we had the onerous duty of escorting Placid's little sis and her friends, the ObnoxiousGlitterMonsters. They felt sorry for us, and rightly so.So we stayed out really late (for us) and when we finally started walking home it was very dark. We were surrounded by fake cobwebs and cheesy animatronic decorations with motion sensors. Every time we passed a giant spider or a phantom in a tree, there was a chance it would wiggle around and scream or sing the "Monster Mash". Keep this in mind when I tell you that we, at first, dismissed the cries of "Halp! Halp! HHHAAAALLP!"Eventually we realized it wasn't someone filled with the Halloween spirit and followed the sound to attempt to help. We traced it to the house of Blubba. Blubba is a morbidly obese redneck man who was in his early fifties at the time, and still living with his mother. As far as I know he's still alive. Everyone in the neighborhood knew about Blubba, because he had a habit of driving his mom's van to fetch his mail. He drove a van a few hundred feet and back to perform a simple, because he was too fat to walk. Apparently this is what he had been trying to do on that fateful Halloween night. We carefully approached the open garage from whence the bellowing whalesong came. We were greeted with a horrendous sight.Blubba was in the usual stained sleeveless undershirt he donned when scooting to his mail in the creepervan. We saw that he only wore skid marked tighty whiteys in his van. He could go straight from house, to garage, to van and back without pants. And he did. On this day though, he got stuck.The van had been parked close to a workbench in the garage and he had become wedged while attempting to get in the van. When he saw us, the blubbering cries only got louder-&gt;"AYHM STUCK! HAALP! GIT MAH MAWM!"In a dazed state of shock, we rang the doorbell of the house repeatedly. His poor, tiny, ancient mother came out and saw the greasy mess that was her son.She ended up calling the fire department to get him out, and apologizing to us. To this day I feel so much pity for her. She was so embarrassed.TL;DR Blubba is so fat, he gets stuck trying to get in his van and traumatizes a group of kids with his grimy skivvies.
34h2h5	-13466	1430446719	vegan	Tips for Making the Switch?	I've been vegetarian for probably a decade. Beginning in my teeny-bopper years, I put my foot down with my southern lard-loving family and started making decisions for myself. The choice was ethically based, as I've always been an animal lover. (My best friends have always been dogs!) The family has never been terribly supportive of my choice to forego meat, so I made an uneasy pact with them to stay ovo-lacto.As I got into my late teens I developed PCOS, and sometimes a wonderful side effect is lactose intolerance; which resulted in lots of pain until I figured out what the problem was. Given that lactose intolerance isn't a choice, it was easier for my family to accept (one step closer!). I'm living on my own now, so I'm using this opportunity to go vegan without the constant battle. It seems more feasible now that I'm only a step away from vegan and 200 miles away from my mother.Basically all I have left to get rid of is egg and egg products. Having PCOS means I can't rely too heavily on soy products, or starchy vegetables for protein. (Another lovely effect is insulin resistance, and messed up hormones. I have to be careful if I want to avoid diabetes and reproductive cancer). I've tried to reduce harm by only getting eggs from chickens I know. One of my professors keeps some in her large backyard. When they stop laying they become just pets, and they seem pretty happy. They'll chill on your lap if you sit down near them, which is pretty cute. It's not ideal though. When you think about it, eating a chicken's period is pretty nasty. Unfortunately most of my cooking knowledge is dependent on eggs for solo use, binders, stabilizers, emulsifiers, etc. I would love tips for the transition and healthy recipes. I really want your opinions on, and experience with vegan recipes/cooking methods. I can google recipes all day long, but nothing is better than first hand knowledge from real people.
34z7v3	-13466	1430855897	atheism	Non-white ethnicities and Christianity?	When I was younger, my mother dragged me to a predominantly black, revivalist, hallelujah chorus kind of church somewhere in the muggy armpit of the south. I was 10 and still identified as christian at the time, but all I could think was "Why?, why are these people christian?"I still wonder this. These were all people who were educated in history and quite a few were activists in the black community. Some of them talked about specific family members from a few generations back who were slaves, and a few had managed to trace their family back to the parts of Africa they were forcibly taken from. So knowing this, knowing that their ancestors were forced into this religion, and many people used this doctrine to justify enslavement, how in the hell can they be christian? Or at least how can they be content with it?True, abolitionists also used the bible to support their cause and eventually won, but both sides had specific verses on their team. I hate to agree with anti abolitionists on literally ANYTHING, but having read the bible thoroughly I gotta admit that the bible sets a huge precedence for slavery. In particular the old testament where it sets out rules for pricing and such. Awful. Horrific. I have no words to describe my abhorrence. This is part of why I'm an atheist.Maybe I'm missing something here, but if I was black (or Hispanic, for that matter) I'd harbor a good bit of resentment towards the concept of following a religion forced upon my ancestors who were enslaved, or massacred, or both. So why? Even if I was theist, I'd at least try to maybe go back to an ancestral or tribal religion just on principle.Again, I'm not really qualified to answer this or understand how any of it feels. My ancestors weren't slaves, they were a bunch of obnoxious dicks that got kicked out of every country in Europe. I want to understand this. So, POCs of r/atheism, care to weigh in?
355hjw	-13466	1430983411	TinyHouses	Advice on where to (legally) put a tiny home?	I'm looking into building a tiny home during the few summers before I graduate from college. It will be a great option for me because my future career could take me across the country. I could potentially work in Cincinnati, or D.C., or Portland, or New Jersey, or California, or a multitude of other places. The location could change with every promotion or new project. So I could potentially be moving every year or every few years.I have the means, expertise, and help to build it no problem. I love the green aspect of tiny homes, but I don't think I can feasibly go 100% off-grid. I need the internet for work, and I also need to be within commuting distance of the city where I end up working. (Also, I'm kind of afraid of composting toilets. They are pretty scary to me, but I might have to suck it up.) It will be on wheels, mostly salvaged materials, and will likely have at least some solar power. So my question is where can I put it? Not every city has an ecovillage, and RV parks can be expensive. Aside from that, how do I even register my tiny home? As an RV? I've heard doing that can severely limit where and how long you can park it. I really don't want to do things illegally unless I absolutely must (regardless of how stupid minimum sq.ft. laws are). Any advice or resources? All help is appreciated.

393rkl	-13466	1433813150	bdsm	Best dildo you've found?	Time for embarrassing stuff, guys. One of my favorite things is double penetration, and my partner has just been using a banana with a condom over it for the second dick. We really want to buy a dildo so we don't have to traumatize any more produce.I've never bought one before and I'm concerned about safety. I don't want to end up with one of those toxic toys I keep hearing about. I'm willing to pay a little more for pure silicone or custom toys, I just don't know which places are reputable.I'd love to find one that is the approximate size of a banana, and about the same softness. (That's roughly the size my partner is, and it's pretty hot to think about two of him fucking me.)What are some toys or companies you'd recommend?
3fw8os	-13466	1438793909	relationships	My 7 year relationship is over, and I don't know what to do.	I [F22] and my partner [M21] have ended a 7 year relationship. We had been together since high school. We were each other's first everything.We went to different colleges and have been doing the long distance thing for a few years, I think this was the main problem.He was the one who wanted to break up, because he was tired of our lack of problem resolution. We have issues like every other couple, but we didn't spend enough time together to fully work through the problem and find a solution. The result was that the same issues would come up again and again.On the night we broke up, we talked and resolved more issues than we had in years. That just gave me more hope that we could work things out, but of course it didn't.He didn't want to dedicate more time or stick around when it might not work, and cause more pain by delaying the end. This is probably right, and for the best. If we reconciled but only for a week, a month, a year, it would hurt even more. This way the band-aid comes off fast.It hurts so much, because I don't have anyone to be mad at. Neither of us did anything wrong. He was my best friend, we were perfect together in bed, and we'd come so far. We made each other better people over the years. We grew up together, and shared so much.I feel like I've lost part of my identity. We were so involved in each other's lives. There is nothing in my life that has no connection to him, everything I look at reminds me of something we did together.I've had to deal with a lot of adversity, even facing down my own mortality, but I've never had pain quite like this.What do I do? How do I heal?Tl;Dr : End of my first relationship, which also happens to have been long term. I feel lost.

In order to fulfill her quest you need to summon here (and keep her alive) for 3 out of 4 boss fights. I still have two boss fights left with her, but I need to re-do one of the other two.I'm going to use a Bonfire Ascetic in either No-Man's Warf or Sinner's Rise in order to summon her.

I have probably asked over two hundred people so far, and not one voted for him (BC).How did this guy win an election if not 1 in 200 random people voted for him?This guy does not represent anything of the Canada I know and love (progressive, reasonable and respectable).
sbjc4	-13482	1334535040	entertainment	So I was watching the Canada's Got Talent...	And after skipping more than 3/4's of every episode to avoid the pre-embarassment fluff (they always build up the biggest humiliations), or pseudo drama following as the 'judges' hum and haw before passing or skidding some poor shmuck I got to thinking.This would be an absolutely AWESOME show, if the show was ONLY the acts without all the rest of the bullshit. I remember when I subjected myself to britain's got talent (I love watching people do amazing things, it makes me proud to be human) and during the semi-finals they showed half clips of various acts that made it through but not onto TV, and being enraged because there were some promising ones that I would have liked to see, and even the terrible acts I would rather watch than the fluff and drama they padded the show with. Oh, and shots of the judges reactions are NOT what I want to see while trying to watch an act. I damn near broke my monitor for all the times they wanted to show buddy's face (simon?) rather than the act he was emoting in response to, numerous times the best part of the act was not shown in favor of a face making faces.So, anyone else want to see a show like this, only without all the stupidity they attach outside of the actual acts?

I was gonna go to the store awhile ago but when I looked out the window I saw a cruiser outside and, thanks to prior experiences, decided to wait two hours until he left.This got me thinking, how many other people are so afraid of police that they stay home when they would otherwise go outside just to avoid, even the chance, of having to deal with them?I feel a coward myself, but I'm not sure it qualifies since, as has been made very clear time and again, the general public has little to no means to defend themselves from police regardless of what they do and that police have just as much (little to none) accountability after the fact.So... any others around here?

sgobk	-13482	1334783897	Bad_Cop_No_Donut	I think I have found the solution to most bad cops	Mandatory digital recording of all police conduct and require that police never shoot first. If recordings are tampered with then the citizen's testimony should be considered more credible than police, and if the cop shoots first it should be treated as murder.The recording is pretty self evident, but I expect the don't shoot first policy would be controversial, but here is my reasoning. Despite what we see in the movies gunshot wounds are rarely fatal (if you make it to the hospital while still breathing your survivability is about 95%), police wear protective body armor, are in constant contact with dispatchers that could provide EMS, and rarely operate alone. So if a cop were shot he would have a much, much higher chance of surviving thanks to those facts than a citizen shot by police (who are often denied medical attention while the police discuss how to proceed with each other, do not have armor, and are often shot by multiple cops simultaneously), and even if someone managed to land a lucky shot killing a cop they would have backup to relay the information and, providing they can shoot worth squat, take out the perp. One armed guy against two with training and armor is not going to have a significant advantage just because he gets the first shot.Cops are often described as brave, but I don't consider the person who attacks first brave, in any circumstances. Having this policy on the books would weed out the cowards that seek badges (you know, the guys who shoot dogs as soon as they seem 'em), and would actually make the profession worthy of respect. I would respect a man (or woman, of course) that tried to resolve things peacefully until the very instant they are directly and personally attacked. But it has been my experience that police are the first to use violence in very near all encounters with the public, and this needs to be changed.

Release all your POW's and we will do the same. Stop killing us and we will do the same. Stop treating us like criminals and we will stop treating you like idiots. In lieu of reparations I ask only that resources be available to help those whose skills have withered in inactivity, those whose education languished in stasis, those who may not even be able to work after having been institutionalized for significant portions of their life.Expecting the justice system, and its investors (including the public), to make amends in the form of a payout is completely unrealistic; there are simply too many people whose freedoms were impinged. Sadly, expecting those who supported the war for all these years in the face of strong evidence it was unjustified would admit their errors and resign is also unrealistic.Many of us are bitter, many have had their lives turned upside down, many have even had their lives taken from them, but let us move forward. Ending a war is not about looking backwards, it is about looking forward, to the future. Let us learn from our mistakes this time, and ensure that prohibition does not take hold again. Let us never again put law ahead of human rights, let us never again take away freedoms that threaten no rights, let us recognize that outlawing things don't solve underlying issues, let us admit that we must first understand a problem before we could ever hope to solve it.Let us admit things we dislike are not a problem simply because we dislike them.I do not ask that you surrender anything (no one will advocate you toke or go to jail), but for a truce. While I cannot speak for all those on the 'wrong side' of the drug war, I would be very confident in stating that there will not be an insurgency. That is, I am very certain that a truce would be honored by those who partake.Just think, no more pot heads kicking down the doors of innocents as they were peacefully enjoying not being intoxicated and using gas mask bongs to deprive them of their nonintoxicatededness. No more people smoking up whole train stations with marijuana vests. No more deals with shifty three letter organizations to transport goods. We will even halt research into weapons of mass intoxication.Here is the olive branch; stop warring at us and we will stop... well, whatever it is we are doing that is as evil as war.Peace.

svv4n	-13482	1335560305	atheism	Organized Religion vs Organized Government	As disorganized atheism becomes more mainstream (and we start losing hipsters) I wonder if we will turn our skeptical scrutiny to organized government.What I see, all around the world, is governments fucking up enormously, and moreso when discussing morality. And the more I think about it the more I realize it is very much the same thing as religion. Authority based on the principle that authority exists, should exist, that some should have it, and others should not. Government does things not because they are a good idea, but because 'it is written'. The topic isn't god it's freedom, the inquisitors use water in lieu of fire, financial security instead of spiritual, precedent not scripture, but both have the exact same disregard for science. The parallels between the concepts is very strong, right up to the same pattern of demonizing things for profit, and elevating hypocrisy to artistic levels. An 'economy' built on the idea that people need to be controlled because they will do bad things if not kept in line.The more I think of it, I see disorganized Humanists standing across from organized government the same way I see disorganized atheists standing across from organized religion. Humanism and atheism are both far stronger ideas, have withstood much critical scrutiny, but organization is a very, very powerful idea in and of itself. What might happen if reasonable people, IE - secular Humanists, organized? In mass?I don't believe in government for the same reason I don't believe in god. I have seen no reason to, and lots of reason to discard the idea. The advancement of our species has pretty much been characterized by us discarding ideas after we establish they are flawed, and I think we are coming close to the point we will have to admit government is a bad idea.

Referencing other data the article estimates it could be as high as 1'200'000. Five years ago.Considering the implications of that study, the likelihood that even the higher estimates are most likely very conservative, and that these numbers are from only one of the countries this 'war on terror' encompasses, it seems very probable that the US's war on a word has killed more than 1'200'000 civilians in the past decade. And if we compare american and non-american civilian fatalities; for every single american civilian killed by 'terrorism' on and since 9/11 in this war between 40 to 400 non-american civilians lay dead. The US total losses in the 'war on terror' is ~9'000 (military and civilian). If the war on terror has caused an even million deaths, including americans, then US fatalities are 0.9% of that total. Even if this 'war' has only killed half of that then american fatalities are still less than 2%.Which makes it the second most one sided 'war' in history, right behind the drug 'war', as far as I know.

Even if this 'war' has only killed half of that then american fatalities are still less than 2%.If we look at historical american civilian casualties as a basis for comparison an even more damning picture emerges.[Almost 800 american civilians died in WWI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_casualties#Casualties_by_1914_borders), [some 1'700 in WWII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties#Total_deaths), 0 in the vietnam war (aside from protesters shot by american police), 0 in the panama war, 0 in the gulf war, and ~3'000 in the terror war, to list a few wars where *some* data is available.The civil war might add up to 800'000, but it seems disingenuous to include self inflicted numbers in this discussion, as they are not only american civilians killed, but they are also civilians killed by americans. Which was kinda the whole point of this post.Sadly, there is little data on american civilian deaths in most wars. The numbers likely are not too high, not a single major war has been fought on american soil, except americans vs americans. Kinda like american civilian casualties in WWII the numbers are simply so low, comparatively, they weren't even worth recording.So if we exclude the civil war then the war on terror has easily killed more non-american civilians than american has lost civilians in over 200 years of warfare. Probably by an order of magnitude, but more specific data is not available to demonstrate this. At the risk of invoking argumentum ad ignorantiam, there is no information to indicate otherwise, and much that implies it is so.Hell, even the civilian deaths in the war on drugs is unavailable, as the US has never released any data regarding how many people have been killed by police.

ugjwc	-13482	1338600694	skyrim	Thoughts on Skyrim, and the Elder Scroll series in general	The graphics in Skyrim are amazing, and the story is pretty good, but this is not what I would have ever guessed would be the fifth generation of the series that gave us Daggerfall.Daggerfall... that game was special. And I don't just mean that it malfunctioned a lot, it was a truly unique, engaging, engrossing experience. It had the best 'paper doll' and list of equipabble items I have seen in a game. Still. (I, personally, miss the pixel based graphics, and would love to see a true 3D game done with them)Morrowind was a graphical and story-telling leap forward, but there were sacrifices made in gameplay; less factions, less skills, less stuff... it was just less game, but it looked a whole lot better. It was, in truth, a worthwhile tradeoff in that rendition. Morrowind was epic. I remember discussing this with a few friends and we had speculated the next game would maintain the level of graphics, that is by improving the quality without increasing resolution with superior techniques (Mario and 3), and bring the content back up, giving us another generated free world in which to play, and some new story telling techniques for quests. Oblivion, however, did the same thing as Morrowind, only far moreso. The graphics made a big jump, and the content suffered even more. And the added dysfunction of trying to make the game 'appealing' with their stupid, and I do mean stupid, leveling system and 'leveled lists'... then I found the extensive modding community. After using wyrebash to make a playable combination of some 450 mods I had a pretty amazing game to play, right before my computer crapped out (I still don't having a gaming computer, sigh). Anyway, the oblivion gates were more a chore than fun, the story played more like a rail shooter, never mind the voice acting (if I wanted to watch screenplays I would watch movies), and the gameplay itself was significantly dumbed down, while the menus were as cumbersome as ever.And then Skyrim. It does the same thing; less skills, less factions (you don't get a menu for tracking ranks, or even ranks), less gear, less options, and everything is as simple as can be. Bethesda should have called the mount &amp; blade guys to design their combat system instead of going the attack till it's dead route. It is really cool being able to forge your own gear, but since you can forge better stuff than you can find it takes away most of the fun of spelunking for rare treasures. Most of the improvements in Skyrim over Oblivion were ones I was enjoying in Oblivion thanks to mods. Like area specific crime, signs that you didn't have to cursor over to read, harvested ingredients that looked harvested, wildlife and weather, etc..Skyrim is completely unrecognizable as the descendant of Daggerfall, or even Morrowind. The game is simpler, appealing to the lowest common denominator, and while entertaining it its own right, it is NOT the Elder Scrolls V I would have imagined, or wanted. This is more like Elder Scrolls: Mystic Quest. Okay, that's harsh, but seriously, where are my journal entries? Where is a map I can use to, oh I don't know, find a ROAD!? Why do my arrows always hit where the crosshair is aimed regardless of distance... or the knee high rock in front of me? Where is a cohesive character overview? Why don't jumping and attacking take effort (stamina)? Why doesn't it matter where you hit something? Why is the sequel less game?But I do have to say this; dragons look, and fight, amazing. This is the first game I think that ever truly captured the essence of winged death that dragons represent so well. They look beautiful, are terrifyingly fast, and usually present a challenge. The problem I see is that because they opted to have them pop up around the world they could not make them as tough as dragons should be. But they are, easily, the most awesome dragons in any game that I know of.You know what I want? Daggerfall on a new, stable, engine that looks good enough to play without bogging down systems (remember when video game graphics *represented* things instead of realistically resembling them?) with some of the new things from later games, like repairing/recharging magical equipment, oblivion gates and dragons. I want a game where I am not some foreordained hero on a quest of prophecy, but where I am whomever I want to be. With reasonable responses to my choices, like being kicked out of a paladin guild for joining an assassin guild for example.I guess the main point of my rant is that as graphics increase the game itself seems to suffer, and that for all the fancy graphics in today's games, perhaps even partially because of them, they are moving closer towards interactive plays than interactive worlds. I don't want to play a role, or choose a role, in someone else's story, I want to make my own as I carve it into the face of whichever magical world I find myself in.

I was here when Skald the Elder was Skald the Younger. [...] The people here look to Brina Merilis when they need things settled. Real firebrand going up. Wasn't surprised when she joined the legion." And Brina herself will occasionally say, "I wasn't born in Skyrim, but when I served in the legion this became my home." And, "Horik and I have lived here ever since I retired."Is the alchemist lady batty, did the gods make a mistake [bethesda], or is there an interpretation that allows these statements to all be true?
ui4lr	-13482	1338694712	gaming	After having played Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim	I would trade both Elder Scrolls IV and V for a Daggerfall II.Hell, forget a Daggerfall II even, just redo Daggerfall, with all the content, new simple but quality graphics (perhaps even sprite based), no bugs, and a couple, but only a couple, modern enhancements (like recharging and repairing magical items).That wasn't a game that was trying to fit you into its story, it's one that let you make your own. I'm tired of these shallow, shiny, simple games being paraded about. I want a something more like Dark Souls, a huge step in the right direction, with the scale of Daggerfall, a user interface that is actually friendly (call me Bethesda, I can design you one. I can't program it, but I can do a complete design that will be intuitive, functional, consistant and friendly), and no story detracting away from the world. I mean, have stories, but have them be a part of the world, don't have the world be part of a story. I want there to be all sorts of neat stuff scattered around to be found. Including dangers far beyond my capabilities, which I would have start small, grow slowly, and are nigh unlimited in potential. Oh, and character level is a stat that should, pay attention here, affect ONLY the CHARACTER. If you're worried about people becoming frustrated by dungeons and quests killing them everywhere a suggested level notation on the [two dimensional, functional, and informative] map, or the journal [which keeps track of what you have done, where, how and with whom as well as any notes your character, or you yourself, may keep], with the added option of disabling such for immersion.Skyrim is not really recognizable as the descendent of Daggerfall, because even though it is three generations later, and it looks a thousand times better, it is not one thousandth the GAME. There are a dozen games in the current generation comparable to Skyrim in terms of character potential and freedom, but none that compare with Daggerfall, or have in more than a decade.Actually... what am I wasting time with this for? Excuse me. I am gonna scour the net and see about finding a fanpatch or mod project that fixes the bugs in Daggerfall to make it playable and find out if the game really is as epic as I recall, or if nostalgia is playing tricks on me. As for Skyrim, I think it's probably like hiring your high school crush off a street corner ten years later; you think it's what you want, and it might even be fun for the interval, but aside from the dragons [that thing with the finger], it is mere shell of the hope the initial attraction represented, and after awhile all that will remain is quiet resentment for the loss of all that could have been.TLDR: Boogers are better roasted.

umve8	-13482	1338936199	gaming	Does anyone else miss sprites?	No matter how carefully planned, or beautifully detailed, no game with polygons has ever had the 'polish' of some older sprite based games. Like Chrono Trigger; sure the graphics in that game were simple compared to today's, but they were crisp, clean, and had character. And modern games, the very few of them there are, that utilize sprite graphics show they can be beautiful (like guilty gear).Pretty near every game released today is riddled with bugs, and while some are gameplay related most are graphical. With these same graphics leading to a demand for increasingly powerful, and expensive, systems. And no matter how powerful a system you have, there will ALWAYS be things screwing up with the graphics and breaking immersion. It's easier to immerse oneself in something with lousy graphics, as long as they are consistent (see books).And for all the impressive 'advancements' made, I have yet to find any technological breakthrough that makes these games more fun. Super Mario Brothers was *fun*, and still is. Mario 3 moreso. Fancy graphics do not make a game more fun, they only make certain fewer people can play them. Being a 'gamer' is becoming an increasingly exclusive club, and the necessity of targeting people who might be able to afford the new hardware is probably a serious factor in why E3 this year is so full of fail. (Although I admit Watchdog looks like a coded wet dream)Frankly, I think the limitations of the older systems ensured better quality games. Developers had to more mindful of what they stuck into the game, and could not hide a lack of quality under mountains of content.So am I alone in this, or is there actually a subset of gamers that pine for a return to the days of 2d and/or sprite based graphics, with a greater focus on gameplay and quality than aesthetics and quantity?

But in all forms, in all ways, it is fundamentally 'authority' that is causing the problems we have in our society, and is also what is preventing us from actually solving them.Authority is not a strong enough idea to build civilization on. It is a fundamentally flawed one. If humans are to be held to the same standards, given the same rights, we *must* discard any, and all, systems that are fundamentally dependent on disparity between us.
w7diq	-13482	1341713833	worldpolitics	The evidence our social structure is fundamentally flawed is piling up.	Every cultural advance has seen people be treated more equally, being given the same liberties and rights as another 'control' group, yet the very concepts upon which modern society are built, economics and authority, are dependent on disparities between people's means and rights.And slowly this system is inching its way towards collapse. While before this same system failed locally, and fairly quickly, we have connected every economy together, and done everything we can to prop it up, thereby putting off the collapse, and expanding the scope of damage when it occurs.I have faith that after our current systems finally fail we will be able to build something better, but humans cling to their ideas until denying they are flawed is impossible. Often beyond even that.While we *could* sit by, and simply wait for this to occur (my predictions from awhile back see us coming to a head in about three years, but much is escalating faster than I expected), I think we would do better to usher this 'failure' in as quickly as we can. The sooner it happens the sooner we can set about fixing it, and the less the cost in human life will be.Thing is, I don't have the first clue how we could do that. All those with the means to damage this system are already doing so (bankers and politicians), and probably more effectively than anyone could have managed intentionally. And those without the means are too busy just trying to stay alive. The latter group being too busy to educate themselves on the nature of the beast is a liability, as is the former's seemingly intentional ignorance of what they are doing.At this juncture, I'm not sure what the best thing for humanity is. Any action taken to further undermine this failing system would victimize people, inaction would victimize more, and any action taken against those causing it through cannibalistic self-interest would prolong it, again causing more victims in the long run.Ideally, we could discard capitalism and democracy and institute a new system before this one goes critical, but not even my idealistic view of our species sees us willing to admit we were wrong to put so much faith in these ideas.We should put our faith in ourselves, and minds, not the products of the same.So... what is the best action, for the future of humanity?

Only those with nothing are truly free, because if you fear losing what you have you are limited.But our society seems designed to do the opposite, as people are only as free as they can afford to be. You can drive anything, anyway, or even fly, if you can pay the fees. You can partake of any drug if you're rich enough the penalties can't hurt you. One can eat or sex any time. The list of things people can do with money that those without can't is endless.But on the flip side, people without are not constrained by it. They have no one depending on them, no obligations, nothing holding them back... all the things those on the other end of the spectrum dream of.So we end up with two extremes, those free of obligations, and those free of limitations, as well as a fair amount of resentment between the two, with most people scattered about somewhere between. The more freedom one has to do different things the less they have to actually do them.And in the end, no one is ever more than half free.Freedom at the expense of freedom... it's circular. It's flawed.We have all become enslaved by a bad idea run amok.

[The wiki on Proof by Intimidation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_verbosity). I have never found a study that shows police activity decrease crime, and when the country of [Georgia fired their entire police force](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4849472) (temporarily) they actually enjoyed a decrease in crime rates across the board.Articles like [this](http://reason.com/archives/2011/04/26/the-war-on-cops-that-isnt) demonstrate that police do not hesitate to use hyperbole to attempt to shape public opinion, whereas articles like [this](http://whentennesseepigsfly.wordpress.com/2012/06/12/the-war-on-the-public/) make it seem likely that police are a greater threat to the general public than the criminal element among the general population. For instance, in LA country 1 in 10 death shooting deaths was at the hands of police, and considering that police make up nowhere near 10% of the population that demonstrates a huge disparity in relative levels of violence between the demographics. In half of american cities it is actually more dangerous to NOT be a cop than to be one, for all their talk of having a dangerous job.In fact, every time I find a side by side comparison between the general public and police it is the police that come off as the criminals. A [2010 comparison](http://www.policemisconduct.net/statistics/2010-annual-report/) between the two populations showed that police have been convicted of violent crime at a rate of 3-5 times the general public (Fig 10 demonstrates this. If one considers 'excessive force resulting in death' to be murder police commit murder at nearly 5 times the rate of the public). Keep in mind those numbers are from convictions, all the charges the police union had stayed or waived, as well as those people were too scared to pursue, are not tallied. It would be naive to think those numbers are not a gross understatement of the actual numbers.I began questioning this myself when I spent a long miserable night in a urine soaked drunk tank while sober, because the cop was of the 'opinion' I was intoxicated and refused me any means to demonstrate he was in err. Having a long time to think of it, I realized the closest thing to a 'good' encounter I have ever had with them was one time a cop opted to not charge me for a minor traffic violation, which endangered no one. The closest thing to a good encounter was not being penalized for something that infringed upon no ones safety or rights... which isn't good, it is merely 'not bad'. Aside from him taking twenty minutes of my life to be so *kind* as to not screw with me further. I had had other, far worse experiences with them as well. To be clear, I have no criminal record, and have never victimized anyone. The one time I called them for help after four drunken loons came to my home and attacked me they were more interested in gaining access to search my home than investigating the assault, and in the end threatened to charge *me* for having defended myself and fighting them off (long before police arrived).I am a pretty unlucky guy (which is funny since I don't believe in luck), so I realize my encounters with police may be a little more unpleasant than some, but, being mindful of confirmation bias, when trying to figure out if the problem was the men I met or the uniforms they were wearing I could find nothing, anywhere, to show police have a positive effect on society. And I have looked.So... is there any *reason* to think we should have police? Or is every argument in favor of the existence of a police force a defined logical fallacy that stands only because we have not critically analyzed the question?

Sorry, context: It was over a game of chess in a public park, and I was commenting how I had no respect for law (I respect humans instead). I think he saw that as an opening to share that he had been convicted of rape.

wt94l	-13482	1342696909	AskReddit	What was your proudest unplanned moment?	I'll start. I was employed as a cook at a sports bar, and was just heading into work via the back door when a loud drunk on the patio hollered something unflattering to a woman walking down the alley. I spoke up on my way by with a flippant 'Come now, that's no way to speak to lady' (I was in a great mood at the time, and tried to convey cheerfulness with my tone, but I suspect I failed), which enraged the guy beyond all reason. He hopped over the railing, ran up to me and, without a word, took a swing, which I ducked. So he swung again, and I avoided that one too. And again, and again, and for what must have been near a minute he was swinging at me with all he had, and caught nothing but air. A couple things were going through my head, like whether or not smacking a customer around would get me fired, and just how much damage it would take to nullify the man (who was a veritable beefcake). Just as I was getting ready to admit I would need violence to end this encounter his buddy, still holding a beer bottle, came running up and grabbed him away, saying something to the effect of 'yer gonna get yer ass kicked.' Which I admit kinda made me smile. Satisfied the situation had been resolved I, very foolishly, turned my back and continued walking to go in to work. Hearing a rustling behind me I ducked, purely on instinct, and felt the breeze from the bottle as it flew through the exact spot my head had been a tenth of a second earlier. Had I not ducked it may well have been fatal. Realizing this buffoon had just rewarded my restraint by trying to kill me I decided it was time to deal with him. I turned around and before I had even taken one step both of them bolted. Heh, if he had been able to punch with half of the speed with which he ran he certainly coulda hit me. I was almost angry enough to chase them down at this point... but my shift started in about five minutes. I had not spoken another word since the ones that started this during the entire event, and there was exactly zero actual contact between us. While I regret not knocking some sense into the guy (especially after he almost killed me), I was pretty satisfied with both my performance, and the fact that I was able to send them both packing without any violence at all.How about you reddit? What moment in your life fills you with pride whenever you think about it, that you hadn't planned for?

And so far I'm liking it, but I am confused as hell as to where I am.I grabbed a torrent off piratebay that listed 'my mother the car' as ep 8, whereas the wiki lists it as ep 7. The comments from said torrent mentioned they were out of order so I was going by the wiki, but episode 8 'in god we trust' showed the scene where the one brother walked in on lucille playing poker, and the narrator explains that's when they started dating, but that scene wasn't in the episodes listed prior to that episode on the wiki, and it seems like I missed quite a bit  (I had thought they glossed over when they started dating, but I now have the impression I am an episode off).Is [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Arrested_Development_episodes) list accurate, and if so why didn't I see that scene? I'm liking the show, but I am pretty lost right now.

But if all people are to be treated equal, then granting special considerations to married couples is contrary to this.Strike marriage from law, redress tax, inheritance, and custody to reflect this, while still ensuring that children (the *only* plausible justification for such considerations) receive the benefits that used to be granted them third hand by such laws. This should have been done when interracial marriages got a bunch of panties in a knot, and another opportunity presented itself when polygamy caused an uproar. Marriage is one of those bad ideas we have to admit it's time to let go of.Society exists for the sole, SOLE, purpose of educating, protecting, and preparing our young. If we could get our heads out of our asses and discuss how to accomplish that perhaps we will have a chance at solving a few real problems, instead of making new ones up.

There simply is no other explanation for his campaign, his statements, or anything else about what he is doing.Sure he's stupid, and sure he's out of touch with real people, but if publicists can convince the mass that jobs was an innovative creator then they can pass romney off as human.It's not like he can't afford the best publicists money can buy.Which implies, strongly, that this clusterfuck of a campaign is intentional. Assuming it is, why could be the motive?The best I can come up with is leaving obama holding the bag when the economy tanks, and hoping for a 2016 win, but the flaw I see with that is the possibility there won't be a US government by then (let's face it, people are warming up to the idea of hanging congress), at least not one that is the same as we have today.Is there a better explanation?

xpklj	-13482	1344160609	AskReddit	I've noticed homeless people are often more moral than our social 'elites', why is this?	I've heard all sorts of stories of homeless people going out of their way for others with zero expectation of reward, risking themselves for those that would not do the same for them, even a few 'bums' who robbed something small just to try and survive only to return it later or turn themselves in out of guilt.And yet I have heard very, very few stories of homeless people causing trouble (aside from existing), and even less violence. I have spoken to a fair number, and most seem more aware of the problems we face as a species, and more burdened by them. Most of those I have spoken to were unmistakably intelligent, polite and caring individuals. If oderiffic.Whereas on the opposite end of the spectrum, we have the romneys, the beibers, the hiltons, the GOP... people so disconnected from humanity they scarcely seem aware anyone else is even alive, except for how they can be of use.For every story of a homeless guy committing a crime there are dozens of stories of crimes against them.It seems very much like our social structure is systematically rewarding amoral, even sociopathic, behavior, while punishing moral, even compassionate, behavior. Are my observations backed up by the data? If so, did we make a fundamental mistake in how our society is built? Is there some other reason good people are ostracized and vilified, while the amoral are empowered and idolized?

xtjn0	-13482	1344343267	AskReddit	What decision has haunted you for years that you're not entirely certain was the wrong one?	About twenty years ago, when I was around 10, I was walking along with my grandma in some woods. For some reason, probably just being a kid, I ran off the path and up a little up a hill. When I stopped I was no more than thirty yards from the path, with my granny hollering at me to come back, and I noticed a small pinkish purple flower that I recognized instantly; it was a [Cypripedium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypripedium), a variety of lady's slipper. I recognized it because I read the 1989 guinness book of world records nearly cover to cover, and I remember the picture of that kind of lady's slipper as being identified as the rarest plant (flower?) in the world. There were few pics in that printing of guinness so they kinda stood out, and even though the image lacked color there was no mistaking it.I had thought if I scooped the soil up around the flower I could take it to my granny without killing it, and since she has one heck of a green thumb I figured she could keep it alive, and maybe even grow more from it.But instead I left it. I didn't want to take the risk of killing something so rare, and, since I had thought it might actually be the last one, the thought of causing extinction myself terrified me (I was big into dinosaurs and science, so was familiar with such concepts).It has haunted me ever since since I know that such a trophy would have been the prize of my granny's garden, and because, as I realized years later, the chances of it being pollinated were quite slim. I remain uncertain whether or not I made the right decision. In all likelihood my choice had no bearing in the larger scheme of things, but it did deny my grandmama the chance to grow a flower I am sure she would have been proud of above all else. And that has always bothered me.How about you reddit? Have you made decisions that might have been the right ones, but nag you years later anyway?

y1hpb	-13482	1344672114	Bad_Cop_No_Donut	Equal Rights	There is no denying the fact that police receive preferential treatment under the law. When driving marked cars they do not even pretend to follow the rules of the road, for which they are never penalized, And even if they are pulled over for violations out of uniform they nearly invariably receive 'professional courtesy'.Never mind the frequency with which they not only get away with murder, assault, kidnapping (false arrest), death threats, and the like, but also keep their jobs as empowered and 'trusted' members of law enforcement.When people are relegated to second class citizens, be they blacks, women, lefties, or homosexuals, there is almost always public outcry, there were been pushes for equality... but not with police. There have been pushes for reform, calls for officers to, at least, be fired, for some of the more severe transgressions, but I have heard no universal call for equality. And there is now a large demographic of people receiving preferential treatment, and this should be untenable to the rest of us.The letter about the cop who was afraid when he had to speak to people in calgary without having a gun emphasized this. When police lack a distinct advantage, when they don't have complete control, they react with fear and aggression. Probably a part of why dogs have such bad luck around them, they are difficult to intimidate. And, of course, being equal means one does not have control over other people. When people can use authority and force to exert their will, there is no incentive to be reasonable, and so they won't be.I think we need to draw greater attention to this disparity of rights, and demand that police be held to the same legal standards as the rest of us. Without exception. And that includes increasing penalties for crimes done from positions of authority.Police fear equality, and anyone threatened by equality is a threat to the same.

y2mhf	-13482	1344733260	nanaimo	Am I a fool?	Walking home from a meeting with someone that will (hopefully) be renting a room to me, I was stopped by a couple that said they were stranded in town, with no way to return to victoria. I am not exactly clear on the details for how they managed to get stuck here with a truck and no way to get money. The women was very pregnant, if that matters. They told me they needed $35 to make the trip home, and would give me their contact information and pay me double, or packs of cigarettes if I preferred, in exchange for the funds. Well, I'm poor, have to move at the end of the month, and have no idea if I can find somewhere that is even in my price range, never mind the damage deposit. So I told them I could give them $20 without hurting myself (I'm poor, but not quite destitute), but they seemed almost fixated on getting the full $35. I explained that $20 is all I could do without putting my own future in jeopardy, and that $15 would be a much easier 'sell' to the next person they spoke to. They were disappointed, to be sure, but they did seem grateful. I went to the ATM across the street, pulled a $20 out, gave it to them and wished them the best.It seemed to me to be a reasonable compromise, because I really did want to help them if they were stranded and I have little to help with, but it occurred to me that if I had taken their contact info so they could repay (I would not ask for double), and maybe some form of ID as collateral or something, I could have helped them without hurting myself if they did repay me. But I gave them the twenty and didn't accept anything as payment or take their contact information.And it has been kinda nagging me, because if it was a scam then I should have given them nothing, whereas if they were genuine and would have repaid me I could have helped them all the way without costing myself, so it almost seems like I actually made the only possible decision that would have ensured I 'lost' whether they were sincere or not. Am I fool, and if so, what do you think I should have done?

147xc1	-13482	1354568268	canada	How can an ex-tenent fight to get their damage deposit back when the resedential/tenancy act does not apply?	I was renting a room off a pair of... people, and they claimed, falsely, that I left a huge mess when I left and used it as a pretext to keep my damage deposit. I have pictures of the room, and it was thouroughly cleaned. I have copies of my rental agreement, which includes a reciept for the damage deposit, and a 'reciept' listing some very... creative 'items' they saw fit to charge me for (like a fee for cleaning up after me every day, despite me never leaving a mess anywhere, or even being there every day). But since I shared bathroom and kitchen facilities the resedential and tenency act (or whatever it's called) does not apply as far as I know, so I am kinda at a loss.In summation, I have proof I gave them damage deposit, and proof that I caused no damage nor left a mess, yet sharing accomodations makes it seem as though I have no immidiate means to contest them for their, frankly, insane claims.So, what is my best next move?
150t04	-13482	1355788868	techsupport	PC won't detect MP3 player. Halp!	The model is Innovatek IN-100. Simple, no screen, 2 gb storage, and while it seems to be getting power through the USB, windows (7) seems oblivious it is plugged in most of the time, except the occasions it says there is a problem. The error is intermittent, and not very helpful, and prompted a re install of the USB drivers once (which had no effect).The USB port is fine, I have 2 MP3 players of the same make, both brand new, that exhibit the same behavior. I did not find the device in the device manager, and exhaustive searching online yielded no answers.Most generic solutions to the same (or comparable) problem for other MP3 players I have tried, but I could find no reference to solutions for this specific one.Thanks for any feedback
159ab6	-13482	1356138017	canada	Is stupidity the policy of 7-11?	I've had a few gripes with 7-11 in the past, such as their preference to throw unsold hot food in the dumpster rather than letting anyone eat it, be it an employee or starving bum. Or apparant inability to heat a sandwhich that doesn't have its own button (apparently giving staff an 'on' button leaves too much room for error).But today was the final straw for me. I ordered two hot dogs for 3, as was their advertized special, but after having paid, via debit because I never use cash, I was told the hot dogs were't hot enough. How long until they were ready was a vague 'awhile'. She offered to refund me so I could put it towards something else (something not on special, or what I wanted), so I suggested tossing the two I bought in the oven for a minute, but I was told that was a violation of their 'safety policy'. Safety policy? It is dangerous to heat hot dogs, that were already sold, in an oven? What kind of dimwits do they employ there? Then I suggested she give me the two bigger ones that were sitting there, and clearly had been for awhile, since it was her screwup to sell something that was, seemingly, unsellable. Nope. Just a refund... which she did with cash. Note this does not refund debit fees. So now I have coins, which I never carry, no hotdogs, and wasted five minutes of my life arguing with someone whose job seems to be to find new and interesting ways to not sswerve people.Why do we put up with this? When did customer service become customer obstruction?Myself: never again will I darken the doorway to 7-11. Whenever policy trumps reason I find myself beyond disgusted.

15zfls	-13482	1357349824	PS3	PS3 stuttering and skipping	My PS3 has recently begun to act up. I first noticed it when I upgraded to the arcade edition of SSFIV, which ran off the HDD instead of a disc. Specifically, the version running off the HDD, which I had expcted to be as good or better than the disc, actually hangs for several seconds before every fight. I didn't think too much of it at the time. But when I installed little big planet 2 to the HDD I found that the music that would repeat half seconds of the track often enough that it was too annoying to even play. And when I installed MTG 2013 I found that the game itself would frequently hang for a moment even when I was just selecting a deck (never mind the 4 minute load screens).The system has been warm, but I wouldn't describe it as hot. I just cleaned out all the dust anyway, and after turning the system off for a while to cool I find the same behavior.I think disc based games act the same way, but I am not certain, and after posting this I am going to try FFXIII to see how it behaves, I ran both utilities for taking care of the HDD that don't require formatting, and it seems to have found/fixed no problems. Is there any way to isolate the drive as the problem, short of testing another one, or figuring out if it is the system itself that is dieing? Or could it be something else entirely, perhaps something that could easily be fixed (fingers crossed).The system has been well cared for, is the 160gB model, and while it has been used a lot it has never been on for 20+ hours on a stretch. The drive is about 2/3rds full, if that helps.Thanks for any wisdom.Edit - FFXIII runs perfectly. I am starting to strongly suspect it is the HDD. Now, if I could just figure out how to verify this before I buy a replacement...

161f3t	-13482	1357438946	magicTCG	Just dealt 20'444 damage in one turn in MTG 2013	I played magic back when boosters of the Dark could be found in the few shops that carried cards, and gave it up shortly after tempest (when the rules were changed so that destroying or tapping the source of an effect no longer prevented it I felt too much strategy was killed). Having gotten the itch to play magic awhile back, a 10$ PS3 game seemed a reasonable way to scratch that, without starting a habit that costs more than crack.It's been kinda neat, seeing all the new cards. Though I think creatures have gotten too powerful (1 mana 5/5 flyers, even if conditional, or a 3 mana 4/5 with no drawback if in a mono color deck), I mean juzam djinn used to be awesome, now he is a chump outdone by commons. And who would ever bother using classics like the lord of the pit with the bigger baddies for less that can't really even be killed. But a monster that DOUBLES in size every turn, for 2 mana plus however big you want it to start? Insane. Pure insanity. And also the source of 19'998 of the 20k that inspired me to make this post (I locked down an opponent, not an encounter, and let them grow to max size... I was curious if there was one)I think magic would have been a better game if it was designed to maintain the original scale, rather than making the new stuff so much better that only cards that used to be considered over powered (and were usually extremely rare) are even worth using. Though I am pleased to see the return of the moxes, the rich have enough advantages in society, they don't need them in games that are supposed to be won by strategy.But on the original point... I don't think it POSSIBLE to deal even a quarter of the damage I did in one round in any deck consisting of cards from before, say, weatherlight. I think WotC has gotten so caught up in making the new cards worth buying that the old cards are not even worth using.Sorry... I just get nostalgic when I think of how magic was, and how silly it seems to me now. To me, it seems very much the same as what happened to dragonball Z; where an interesting and promising foundation was built into such a clusterfuck as to be unrecognizable.I just hope they someday make a video game that includes all the cards, has an adventure mode where you can explore ruins, caverns, etc., to collect cards, perhaps one done where cards from new expansions are available only as you progress, kinda like the one they made for the PC back in the 90's, only much, much better designed. Anyway.. yeah. 20k, one turn. Just wanted to share. Cheers.

16sako	-13482	1358469020	Ni_no_Kuni	This really interests me, but I have a couple concerns...	I love RPG's, the collecting, stat maxing, etc, but I hate, absolutely HATE, real time rpg's. I understand that much of battle is real time, but there are different degrees of reali-time, some of which I don't mind at all. Grandia, for instance, I really like because it is only real time when you are not trying to decide what to do, and FFIV-VI were good because you could have the game wait while selecting spells, and there were some other games that you could at least pause the fight and decide what to do... but in, say, FFXIII when you paused the game it blurred the screen so you could no assimilate any available information or form strategy. This actually turned me off from the game so much that it is the first FF game I didn't finish (not counting 11).So, are there options or means to take my time (and have a toke) while playing this game, or is it one that demands constant attention that one could not play and relax at the same time?

16siwf	-13482	1358475860	AskReddit	What was the ad that ran during the view in regards to obama's action/stance on gun control?	My friend who was watching the view (I know, I have no excuse), said that there was an ad that came on during it which was 'official from the government' wherein obama said that armed guards were necessary to keep his children safe, but he would keep everyone else's safe by banning all guns.I don't believe it. For one, why would a second term president run any ads? Secondly, it is contrary to his stance. Third, such an ad would portray him as an hypocrite, and while he certainly is, he is saavy enough to avoid being blatent about it.Anyway, until I can find out the specific clip, watch/show it, and explain to my friend that it was not what she thought it was I will not be able to resolve an argument that has already escalated beyond all sanity. I suspect she saw the NRA ad I saw alluded to a few times around the net, most notably in a huffington post article, but I ma brosing the internet on a ps3since my comp melted, and can't watch the clip attached to that one. If any of you happen to know the clip I am looking for, and a youtube link so I can watch it, and find out the truth behind it, I can end an argument (even better if I am wrong, as I have an easier time changing my mind than my friend).Thanks.

172ojf	-13482	1358885451	Ni_no_Kuni	Performance issues...	Just got the game, am currently at the first possible chance to save, and have noticed a few things that may spoil the experience this game has to offer... things that I kinda suspect are unique to myself, or my system.The audio was skipping a little during some of the cutscenes, which caused it to go out of synch, which made the exchange between the boy and his mom over breakfastg kinda... odd. I noticed too that sometimes the video would also hang, for no more than half a second, causing the audio too as well. I have only seen a few of these 'stutters', but I am only ten minutes into the game dammit.I find such things to be very immersion breaking at worst, highly distracting at best. Anyone else encountered this, or is it just me?Edit - I tirned off the system for awhile, which I hadn't done sinc I installed it, and it now runs beautifully (I have the disk version, but it still installs 4 gB). Problem solved... or at least gone.

If the install data contains the audio then I can take that as confirmation replacing the HD will resolve my problems, if not then I am back to square one for fixing this damned 'stationThanks.
17serb	-13482	1359861884	Ni_no_Kuni	Does anyone else think that... (spoilers)	The entire 'game' may be naught but the delusions of a 13 year old boys mind that was shattered in the overwhelming grief that stemmed from killing his own mother?He is called the 'pure hearted one' by everyone in the magical world, yet we see indications early in the game that Oliver tends to get himself into trouble in the real world. HIs mother is alert both to the possibility of his duplicity, and sneaking out, and a few other people around town make comments that indicate he is often up to mischief. The 'magic' starts while you can see Oliver's mind cracking, his own magical powers are always just what he needs, and he suddenly beomes the 'pure hearted hero' he wishes he could be. The 'prophesized one'... though no one ever says who told the prophecy.One thing that particularily stands out was that olliver's mom, when she gave him the doll she said she knitted, knew how faeries talked. Afterward there were events that explained how she *chould* have known how faeries spoke (overlooking the comment about making drippy, the years she must have kept drippy stored to give to oliver that particular day, and how new the doll looked at the time), but it seems more like a 'cutesy' voice a parent might use than a form of dialect that would emerge from cultural evolution. And there is also the part of how drippy isn't there during Alicia's confrontation with Shadar, and all the holes that creates as to where he was, and how he came to be given to oliver, or *why* she would entrust a cursed and transformed friend into the ignorant care of a young child.And there is also the theme of the white witch, and her imagination running wild.Basically, "Oliver created a fictional world to hide from his grief and guilt in" is a far simpler explanation "Oliver's mother and stuffed doll are refugees from a magical world that can only be saved by Oliver". If one applies Occum's Razor...

1ckppp	-13482	1366247514	atheism	So what the hell is with the 'euphoric' nonsense, and constant hate /atheism gets?	I'm seriously starting to think there are a bunch of theist fuckwits parading around and either badmouthing atheists because 'god hates them', or masquerading as atheists to help create the fiction that atheists are ass holes.I suspect so because for all the 'neckbeard' and 'so euphoric' mockery, whenever someone posts a link to an atheist being a shit head it was doctored (like that recent 'why don't you go pray about it' in response to someone laid up in the hospital dying). There are many examples of atheists being dismissive, and frustrated in the face of irrational arguments, but very few of them being intentionally dickish, or ruder than the other party (the worst things said to me, ever, have been by theists that had no arguments left).Yet, it seems /atheism is the single most hated sub reddit, and as far as I can tell for *exactly* as much reason as atheists have ever received hate. We are being cast as, and sold as, villains to the larger reddit community, with posts about unsubscribing making up a large part of this reddit, and a couple others as well. It's almost like unsubscribing from /atheism has become a subscription in and of itself.Point is, this is the medium in which we can attack belief using evidence and reason (violence doesn't work to stifle expression here), and we have enjoyed great success in loosening the grip religion has on human society (and psyche), but I wonder if we have not become complacent when it comes to our own defense. We are being slandered, presented as things we are not, and every time some knucklehead makes a 'euphoric fedora-wearing neckbeard' comment it serves as an affirmation of that perspective even, or especially, when it's not true.I very much suspect that a lot of the most 'cringe-worthy', or overly ignorant, posts here are actually the work of theists trying to undermine our credibility, and we need to be alert to this. Remember, these people have made a living for thousands of years by manipulating human perception and thought, while we have only recently become more than the unwanted fringe elements of society. There are a lot more people interested in controlling thought than freeing it, and it would be naive to think they were not still trying to do so here.

Seems to me that if you encountered someone raping his daughters, and murdering his sons, you would be kinda morally obligated to kill him. And if you are frozen and starving, then the larder and shelter would be icing on the cake.And on a related note... why did that guy help buddy to escape, killed his pursuers, only to bring him back?

These groups would certainly hate to be classified alike... but perhaps it would help them put into perspective just how little difference there is between their god, and the false god their enemies worship.These people are our brethren, we don't want to divide and conquer them; we would serve ourselves, and them, far better by uniting and educating them. To this end, I propose 'theist' should become the preferred manner of addressing these people.

I told this joke to no less than 2 dozen people, and no one got it (thanks to knowing nothing about blacksmithing or shoeing horses), and stopped telling it. Eventually I forgot it, and am left now with only a memory of a memory of a joke whose loss saddens me terribly.All I can recall is that it was not a one-liner, but I don't think it was very long. Appreciating the joke was only possible if you actually knew a little about how farriers and smiths actually did their job in a pre industrial era, and the only other thing is that horseshoes were, I *think*, integral.

1h0io1	-13482	1372129683	gaming	Are turn based space empire games a thing of the past?	I know there have been a couple made in the last few years, but they were weak examples of the genre. Nothing since MOO2 has even approached that level of popularity (that I know of), and the few attempts at 4x space games that are actually of quality, such as distant worlds, are real time. Well, to an extent, being able to pause the game and do things goes a long way towards mitigating my personal dislike 'real' time strategy games.But, even the few contributions to space 4x games that have come around in the last decade are *all* for the PC. Which is fine, I suppose, for most people who play them, but I would really like to see one for a console. But I never hear of anyone clamoring for such.Is the genre dead, relegated to a small niche of the PC market, or is the a chance they will find their way onto the consoles of the next generation?

1jbohk	-13482	1375153857	cats	My cat has suffered an eye injury... I can't afford a vet.	I can't tell if she still has her eye, I think so because I am nearly sure I saw it before it swelled last night. Right now, it looks like her second eyelids have swelled shut... except they close vertically. So... if a sliced eyeball turns white and swells, that is another explanation. One I would rather not consider, but clearly can't ignore. She is in pain... but in control. She sat quietly and let me look pretty closely at it, but I could only pull her eye open a little before it hurt too much. There is fluid coming out; tears, pus, and a little blood. Just took a couple pics but the quality is shit, and it will take me a few to transfer them over.Kitty is eating, drinking, mostly herself, and seems to be fairly ok considering. So what is my next step? Should I risk being a little rough to make certain there is nothing embedded in her eye? Or just watch and see for now? It happened last night I think, but have zero clue as to what it may have been.Damned cat has the worst luck... and I can tell she is expecting me to do something again.Edit - Definately still has the eye, just a lot of swelling around it. Edit 2 - I'm not taking her to a fucking vet. I love my cat, but she is a cat. One apocalypse away from going into the pot. If she croaks I will get another... but I will do what I, myself, can. I've pulled a tooth that went bad, I cleaned out large bites on her rump that got infected and almost killed her... and now she is looking to me to do something again (well, squinting at me anyway).Edit 3 - Pine needles, I think. Three of them were embedded in her. Not entirely certain if it was the eyelid, or eye itself, but it hurt her quite a bit when I yanked them out (all that was visible looked hair that wan't quite her color, but they were attached to what looks like inch long pine needles), but after the first one was out she was purring, and patiently waiting me to get the others. She can open her eye a little now, and is clearly in much less distress. The swelling has come down a lot too, though there is still some puss seeping out.I'm pretty sure at this point that she will be fine.

Except that after installing it it has no plugins, the homepage has no separate downlaods, and all instructions and advice I can find online presumes you have KOTOR in the sidebar after installation. So, what do I do now, or alternatively; does anyone have the KOTOR plugin, can provide a link, and instructions on how to get it into flawless widescreen?By the by, I did a fair amount of research before posting this, and would be grateful for any help.

I have played since crystal, myself, and rather feel I outgrew pokemon games because they didn't grow with me. And I don't think I am alone in this. The plots, the dialogue, the characters, everything in the game is designed to be appealing to 12 year olds, except for IV's and such. Which is fine, as long as you don't want to sell those twelve year olds sequels when they are 14, or 16... or 31.Nintendo makes two versions to maximize sales, but it seems selling both to the same demographic rather limits this strategy.

I am doing some volunteer work with children, and had to get a criminal record check for obvious reasons.Awhile back I was arrested when a cop saw me walking to the corner store at 2am. He declared me drunk (I wasn't), and threw me in the tank. My requests for a breathalyzer or sobriety test were ignored, and it was explained to me that the cops are under no obligation to grant either and, yes, they can toss anyone in the tank if they are of the 'opinion' the person was drunk. Anyway, they charged me with obstruction and possession of marijuana. The crown dropped both charges when I made it clear I would not plead, and would fight both tooth and nail.Fast forward two years to me volunteering. Turns out that being *charged*, even when those charges are withdrawn, still shows up your criminal record. What the fuck? Now I am uncertain I will be able to volunteer because of this bullshit, regardless of the fact that I have never been convicted of anything in my life. Cops... even when they can't fuck you they still fuck you.I'm pretty pissed off about this. I was told that this would show up on any record check for five fucking years. Five years I am going to haunted by charges that were dropped. FUCK!

Street fighter used to be one of my favorite gaming franchises, but with the 5000$ worth of costumes, icons, and other nonsense, all I see is an attempt to exploit me.

Back when B/W first came out I made a list of well over a hundred things that were either done better in prior versions, or could have been improved very easily. Largely UI complaints, but I recall there were things from most aspects of play that rather bothered me. I had posted the list of gamefaqs... but it is long gone now, unfortunately.I understand that pokemon is a tried and true formula, but it seems like improvements to the game itself come in tiny baby steps, with the occasional stumble backwards. B/W was quite underwhelming. It turned me off enough I never even looked at B/W2.Kinda leery about X/Y, largely because I would need a 3ds to get into it, and noticing they are using the same damned fire/water/grass starter lineup does not bode well for for my hope of a new take on the old game.So... is X/Y truly a generation ahead, or just a polished rehash?Edit - And I freaking hate dreamworld.

Thank you to everyone that read this, and this entire community.I have been wrestling with depression for five years. Recently my Grandmama decided to give me a hand up, and loaned me enough money to get my license straightened out (had a fine for driving without insrance) and buy a used jimmy... whose transmission blew a week after I got it and after I had sunk ALL the cash I had into it (replacing fluids, engine/tranny flush,etc..).Managed to trade it for a running ford taurus, but now I need to do some repairs on this before I can depend on it, or even operate it safely. The front rotors are warped badly, the alternator is nearly dead, the engine coolant is acidic, and the tires are very worn and leaking. There are several other issues that I don't consider critical (mold in trunk, oil, fuel filter, AC fluid, etc) as well, but will be working on them after I have paychecks coming in.This car is to help me find and commute to work. I cannot (and would not) ask my Granny for another cent, and I am already going to have to take out a payday loan (I get a small penion because of the depression) just to cover half of this months rent I still owe.Any help I get will be paid back (or forward if preferred). As to what would help me; cash (obviously), rotors, tires, or an alternator for a 2001 for taurus if someone has 'em lying around. I am no mechanic, but I intend to learn how to do as much of this myself as possible.I am *this* close to getting my head above water, and wouldn't need much help to be set. Thanks for reading.In nanaimo, BC, by the by.

I have found that I usually remain partially erect after an orgasm, enough to continue having sex until I harden again. Sometimes though, I don't regain my erection. Which can be embarassing, especially since the only way I have found to do this is to try to hold back, lessening the intensity of my first orgasm so much my partner may not even realize I had one (which is fine, when this works the second one is always stellar and my partner enjoys the longer duration).There are numerous tricks and sources of information for postponing orgasms, and I intend to start trying the various excercises to learn that as well, but mantaining an erection after an orgasm is a topic that I think is less discussed.Thanks for any advice.

22647u	-13482	1396589233	Bad_Cop_No_Donut	On april 18 2019 I apperently 'failed to produce proof of insurance' when I informed a cop at a checkstop the registration for the vehicle I was driving was in the vehicle I was following.	I had proof of insrance in my car, had just sold it and the buyer tore off the registration part of the inurance paperwork (is how it's done in BC). I was following the buyer to thier destination and when the cop asked if I had registration I informed him it was in the vehicle before me (who was stopped waiting for me). His failure to ask for proof of insuance, which I had, somehow became my failure to provide it.And the confused mother fucker wrote that it happened five years from now. Pretty sure I'm gonna be able to beat it easy enough, but what a waste of time dealing with this shit. Greedy bastards, out to bleed the public any way they can far as I can tell.Edit- Oh, and when I informed him I had proof of insurance after he handed me the ticket he called me a liar and refused to even look at it, claiming the ticket was written and there was nothing he could do about it any way.

25uv9j	-13482	1400414185	Cartalk	Any way replacing a transmission could cause a vehicle to shake at high speeds?	Drove my 97 jimmy less than a week before the tranny blew, and it sat for a couple months so I may misremember, but Iam near certain the wobble I get after 90kph wasn't there before. After 120 the whole truck shakes bad. I kinda have the impression it is in the rear end, so balanced the rear tires (too poor for all 4)and that had no effect. I had canadian tire do a courtesy drive/inspection and they could find nothing obviously wrong. Mechanics I have been talking to speculate u-joints, axle, drivetrain, rotors or brakedrums (and a few others besides), but I can't even afford one repair bill, never mind several.But... if the tranny job did it maybe I can get the guy who insalled it to fix it, and if not then what might it be?

2c8au7	-13482	1406805829	relationships	I (32m) scared my (21f) girlfriend without realizing it. Now she is almost certainly moving home (100s of Km away)... and there is nothing I want more than to undo the damage and keep her	She was kinda seeing someone when I swept her off her feet (a month ago), a long distnce relationship that was not satisfying her needs. She broke up with him the day after she moved into my apartment. Or, rather, let him know. Immidiately after he started messaging her a lot more, and a couple days after, while we were on a river 'beach' I figured out she didn't tell him she was with someone else.The ex is a pilot, who was coming to town to take her on a trip in a couple wees. I wasn't threatened by this, but when I learned she hadn't told him there was another man I realized that she was likely either using the ex, or keeping him on the back burner as a spare, I confronted her about it. It seemed... kinda immoral to me.Problem is, I did that while driving back from the river. In my truck, in the woods, I parked and talked with her about it. She wanted to go home, but I hadn't appreciated that she meant right now... and when she got upset I thought it was because of what I was saying. And didn't clue in that she was afraid and felt helpless. So I kept trying to explain myself, to make her feel better. I was bothered by her apparent willingness to dangle/exploit her ex, I didnt think he would come and fly her around for a week if he knew, but that would have been sorted if I gave it time. I think.But I scared her.She moved out within two days. I am a kind man, and naive... not ony would I never harm anyone, it doesn't even occur to me that someone may feel threatened. She wans to be friends, she says she will be coming back in a few months... but I don't know if I could do that. I care too much to be able to handle the emotions when sheis with someone else (something that WILL hapen if we are separated and in different provinces).What do I do? There is a chance, I think, of her staying around and coming back to me, and there is a chance if I could deal with it that sh would com back to me someday, but I don't think I could survive the latter, and don't think I have the time to win her back before she goes.I am attracted to this girl more than I ever have anyone. While she is beautiful, my attraction trancends that; she is independant, smart, determined, skilled, has a strong character, is fun to be around... and is a great compliment to me, opposite when not similar. I would do anything to keep her... anything moral, anyway.TLDR Met perfect girl, scared her in a moment of obliviousness, would love to save it and have no idea what to do.Update - thanks for the advice, and kind words. She is going in two weeks, and I doubt I will get to even see her again. I don't think she will ever wan me back, and I won't attempt to contact her... but could never say no to her if she did.

2gyu1t	-13482	1411235971	tifu	TIFU by trying to get laid.	Happened last night. This girl I hung around with a couple times, even went skinny dipping with her once, calls me upand says she and her friend want to come have a few drinks and joints at my place. Two girls? One of which I knew was attractive, and not too shy? Damn rights they can come over.So I go and pick them up. And the new girl is actually pretty good looking. Older than I like, but looked great for her age, with a nice body, long healthy hair, and a few other things going for her. Why, when she told me she had four kids I was blown away, would never have guessed it. No stretch marks, no visible sag... just a healthy and fairly hot cougar. The other girl is much younger, but after having skinny dipped with her, and not done anything else, I kinda figured she wasn't too interested in me that way. And me and this cougar were hitting it off.So after the first six pack was done, and tenative plans for a swim were discarded, the younger girl decided she was going home, and the older one accepted my invite to grab some more beer and hang. So we did. Two more six packs, strong beer, and proceeded to get a bit blitzed.And one thing starts leading to another, got a hand on one of her firm tits, sucking her face, and my other hand starts working its way into her panties to stimulate her... penis!? Wait, what? Full stop. Penis? This is where I always thought I would jump out a window or something... but she is still ready to go, looked pretty good, I was hammered, and she didn't want me to do anything to do with that... so, alright, fine, let's see what this anal hype is all about.Lights are out, I'm in, and slip out, and notice a dark shadow on the sheets. By this point I was already largely turned off, turns out I don't like anal nearly so much as actual sex, so I stop, get up, flip the lights on, and yup. Shit all over. Amazingly, there was no odor, but I was still disgusted, and at this point I was done. Hopped in the shower, threw out my sheets, napped on the mattress, and drove the 'girl' home.Next time, I think I'll stick with my original plan of jumping out the window.TLDR- friend calls me to hang a brings a girl, girl and I hit it off, girl's not a girl, near enough to one that I try... and got shit all over my only sheets, that are now in the dumpster.

Tired of seeing people getting preferential treatment just because they have the right system or are in the right area.Personally, and this may just be ignorance, I don't see why it should be any trouble to update all versions equally.Anyway... is the console version going to get any love, or will the console version get the same red headed stepchild treatment as the vita itself?

What do I do?(bastard really screwed me, I borrowed for fuel and money to keep working, now have overdue bills as well. This is, literally, ruining my life)
2l0zz2	-13482	1414891293	Assistance	After borrowing what I could for fuel and food so I could keep working, and putting off my bills for as long as I could... my employer has refused to pay me. Now I'm boned.	I was just labor, and a bloody hard worker. Something happened with the job, and my boss got skidded (suspect he was more hack than carpenter, but I don't know enough to be sure), and he wasn't paid. So he's not paying me. Far as I'm concerned, that isn't my problem. My 'boss' owes me, not his boss. And I doubt I am gonna see a nickel at this point.But I'm in the red, and possibly really screwed. I took out a payday loan because I had been expecting to get paid and needed to stay mobile for work, and put off my insurance payment until about when that payday loan is due, which is when my next payment and rent is coming out of my account. And payday loans come directly out if not paid earlier too.Icing on the cake? My bank is actually located several hundred km's from me, and atm deposits take a week to clear. So, to keep my head above water I need to deposit at least 300 more into that account before the end of this next week. I have some money coming in that will cover the bulk of my expenses, but I'm at least that far behind now.I have found another job, and will be starting next week... but if things keep going the way they're going I'm gonna have so many fees and fines I'll be out another grand. Well, couple hundred anyway.So, this post. I'm able enough I'll get through this, I think. Now... have been struggling with depression, but was making my life better so was winning that battle. But if someone here has a surplus of wealth, and a dislike for people being taken advantage of, even a fraction of what I had earned would take my life from near desparate to comfortable (had I been paid it would be enjoyable).There are certainly people here who need assistance more than I... but the sheer injustice of my situation has made me so infuriated I can't even think straight. For the first time in my life I find myself wishing actual harm on somekne, and that kinda scares me.

Now, if police weren't permitted to use pre emptive, and lethal, force at, seemingly, whim there would be some truth to it.Maybe cowards and bullies would stop being the standard if a little courage was required.And here is another thought. GSW's are over 90% survivable if your heart is beating when you get to the hospital. Who has a better chance of making that trip? A cop with a partner and in constant radio contact with thier dispatch, or a, possibly innocent, civilian bleeding in handcuffs while the police discuss thier next move?Never mind that one of these people, supposedly, knowingly accepted a dangerous job.Far as I am considered, the first shooter is the bad guy. With very, very few exceptions.Why a crazy idea? Because it's reasonable, and it seems crazy for me to keep thinking people might be.

More game modes, especially longer dungeons.More challenges, including some where the levels, not your items, are the challenge.Add an icon to the game, maybe where the hard mode one appears, depicting if you have the poloroid or negative.Disable flying characters using key blocks.Make slots/cup game more varied.Add more pill icons so you can get more types in a run.I had a few more, but slipped my mind just now.

Well, not really, bag of rice and some pasta. But that isn't food, I worked hard for that money I didn't get, need meat.Anyway, don't know anyone around. Bored, lonely, broke, and pissed off becuse I would be none of those things right now if that puke had paid me my wages. Well, maybe lonely, but at least with a few bucks in my pocket (and fuel) I could try to meet someone. As it stands, I borrowed everything I could to keep working. I can't even afford a fucking coffee from tim hortons right now.And this is fucking sucking. The ONLY entertainment I have is my vita, with no games I wanna play, and a browser that makes typing and browsing a nightmare.Sigh. Guess I can just be thankful I have a home (for now, rent may be iffy), haven't been shot by police for no reason (seems like that's all that's happening in the news), and I won't starve (yay, rice).Tired of working hard and being honest only to be taken advantage of. Tired of living in poverty while busting my ass. Tired of being victimized when I have never victimized anyone.Tired of being penniless in a society while the least deserving have everything.

Or kreiger going from a creepy silent supergenius that could build anything to a whiny pervert that is half hack and half muppet?For me, the first two were huge improvements... but krieger used to be my favorite and now I don't even like him.The other characters, to me, didn't seem to change so much as simply being fleshed out. What do you folks figure?

The only character in any FF I can think of that died in a fall was Dyne... but barret shot him to pieces first so I doubt the fall mattered (though we never do see his corpse, or death fade away).Was gonna provide an example from each game after IV, because I'm near sure there is at least one in each... but my brains not working to good right now, and it has been a long time since I plqyed most of 'em.

After looking for work for several weeks, I was desparate enough to drop off a resume at shell (saw a help wanted sign when using their bathroom). And they hired me immediately, two weeks ago. For graveyard, at minimum wage, with no perks, benefits, discounts, breaks, or even advances.After working for a week I asked for an advance, I had almost no food or fuel. Flat out nope. I was going to quit right then just because then they would have to pay me in two days and I didn't have enough gas to get back the next day. But a co worker loaned me 20 so I could drive to work (she didn't want more shifts), so I didn't. Boss told me payday was in a week.Today. But it isn't today, today is just 'cut off', and actual payday is NEXT week. I have more than 80 hours banked, and not a dime to my name. No food, no fuel, nothing. I was going to quit this morning, for the same reason (ironic, to quit a job just to get paid), but my grandmama opted to loan me 50 for fuel and food. Though she is pretty unhappy about it.Fuel and food. The company employing me is unwilling to pay me money owed  to keep me alive and get to my job outside of their schedule. A company, I might add, that sells both.Three weeks to my first payday, with one week towards the next cheque. What kind of person desparate enough to accept a minimum wage graveyard job can go another three weeks without pay? That 'help wanted' sign is surely a permanent fixture (and it looks like it has already been there awhile). Fuck you Shell. And every other company (and people) that prefer policy to reason.

Ran into her yesterday, and gave her my number after a brief exchange.Couple hours later she calls me up and says that her and a friend are looking for someone to drink with and somewhere to drink. Well, sure. I was bored and lonely, drinks with a pair of girls sounds fun (and for the first time in months I actually had about 50 bucks I could afford to have fun with), so I told her they were welcome to join me.So... things, as always, started out fairly slow; music, cards, telling of jokes, etc.. And as the liquor started to flow freely one girl passed out, and the other one and I started to hit it off. And, well, we had a blast together (best time I've had this year, she was a wildcat). And about then the first girl woke up.So we grabbed another bottle, and food came up. Pizza was the decision, and since my neighbor had just locked his internet (I've been too poor to get my own, and there has been an unlocked network here for months), phone books aren't really a thing anymore, and none of the newspapers I had listed a single pizza joint I ran across the street to the store to get a number for pizza.I came back to an empty apartment. They took the booze, the weed, my pipe, and pretty near everything of value. Kinda baffled, frankly. I thought we were having a good time, and that the one girl was into me. They didn't really even get much; a quarter ounce of pot, about twenty bucks worth of liquor, and mebbe about thirty bucks worth of misc shit. And they preferred that to my company.Oh... there was one thing left behind. The girl that passed out left behind a small plastic bag with some papers in it. Release papers. From a *youth* correction facility. So while I now know her full name and who she is, I now also know that I really shouldn't have been hanging out with them (even more than when I realized they cleaned me out). She is quite a bit younger than I had thought (obviously), and I know the other girl I had the tumble with was older, though I don't know exactly how old. I don't believe 29 any more (she seriously looks at least 25). I'm confident I didn't do anything illegal (16 is age of consent here), but I feel like a fucking creep. A real stupid one.TLDR - Partied with 2 girls, and more with one, went to arrange pizza, girls fucked off with everything, except for a document telling me I was drinking with people that should be at home on a school night.Update - Just ran into the one I that hadn't passed out back at the library. First thing she said; "what happened?". I told her. She said she blacked out about when her friend woke up. She gave me my pipe (I had JUST bought another), all the money she had on her ($25, which pays for much of it), and an apology. Still pissed.Update 2 -  She really was 29. And she knew the other one was 15. Damn... and I felt like a creep.

As I was changing lanes I did a habitual (and unneccessary in this case) shoulder check, and as I looked ahead I saw the van hadn't moved. I was on the highway, so was at speed, although a little less than the speed limit due to conditions (wet and rainy), and I braked as hard as I could. And he still didn't fucking move. Best I could do was put my vehicle halfway between his and the next one... and I grazed up about 6 feet on the side of his van. It was either that or hit the other one. Damage to me is neglible, less than my deductable (which sucks, a write off actually would have been a good thing), while his is gonna be about a thousand. Just enough I can't pay it or negotiate. And as I came to a stop and immediately jumped out of my truck I looked up and watched the light turn yellow.If he had turned, like he was signaling and the light was telling him it wouldn't have happened. If he had even STARTED his turn at ANY point he had the green light to do so it wouldn't have happened (even if he had only moved five feet by time I got there). But because my vehicle hit his they are holding me liable. It's my fault for thinking another driver would do what they were supposed to do.FUCK.

I don't like the color scheme, way too much yellow and orange, blue and gray make for more comfortable menus. And also I find the artwork for the character portraits I've seen so far to be rather lackluster.Still, pretty stoked for this. Demon gaze was meh and easy, I can't buy elminage for some reason, and this is looking like the best thing to happen to dungeon crawlers on this system yet.

35wm9c	-13482	1431572505	atheism	Tests of faith are actually tests of obediance	Thinking about that the other day. With only one exception, every test of faith in the bible wasn't a test of whether a believer would continue believing, but whether they would obey when their own reason, instincts, and well being demanded they not.And, when it comes right down to it, that is what the kings want. So how devout someone is isn't a measure of 'faith', but rather of obedience. And kind of explains why 'godliness' has been equated to good throughout our history.Just a thought I figured to share.

35zht5	-13482	1431635780	NoStupidQuestions	Why do we take bomb threats seriously?	If someone was serious about bombing somewhere, I don't see why they would sabatoge that effort by warning people. Has a bomb ever even been found after a threat made?The local highschool where I live has shut down twice in the past week due to threats. No bombs were found, or course, but now there are police all over the place (which is a terrible idea for several reasons), and the kids have learned a phone call can get them a day off from school.Besides, were someone determined to cause trouble with our current responses one man with twenty disposable phones could shut down an entire city with a few phone calls. Possibly costing the local infrastructure more money, and lost revenue, than an actual bomb would have.No one who makes threats is one, not a serious one. Genuine threats fall into two categories in my experience; those that give zero warning, and those who claim to protect you from them.

That is to say, I have mastered the art of being unattractive (despite relatively good looks). I was thinking about it, and to be entirely frank I have no idea what women find attractive. I tried this dating site awhile ago, and actually met this one girl for coffee. She liked my pic, specifically calling me hot, and was very interested in my... attributes (our messaging before we met was fairly frank), but after we chatted for about 20 minutes she had no interest in me whatsoever. My line of thinking was that perhaps if I learn what women find attractive, I'll have a better idea how to avoid being unattractive.
36lyyg	-13482	1432119201	tifu	TIFU by, once again, not taking a fight seriously.	This happened today, not even two hours ago.I'm a pretty tall guy, and pretty fit, so people rarely start trouble with me. And pretty near everytime it's happened I was stronger and faster by a significant margin (hell, I once set two guys running merely dodging everything one guy could throw at me, including a beer bottle when I turned my back thinking the other guy had his friend under control). So, basically, I really don't feel threatened by people. Unarmed people, anyway. And as a result of this I rarely take such situations seriously, which is kinda why I turned my back on someone determined to do me harm.Well, tonight was more of the same. First I nearly got into a fight with my drunken landlord, he thinks 20k is too fast for a parking lot and I'm tired of hearing about it. His wife talked him down on my way into my house, a nieghbor on my way out. I may not consider a threat of violence from a man a serious one, but it is not in my nature to back down. Anyway, he was pissed, we were both pissed off, and that was the scenario when I walked towards a nearby coffee shop to use their wi fi.Two teens came out of some woods as I was walking past, right at the edge of the parking lot, and one yelled "You the guy?" So I stopped and asked what they were talking about. Apparently one of them had been sucker punched by someone they sent running after feeding him a few shots. So I told them about my run in with my landlord... just before he comes over two either fight me or chase those two drunken (but less than him) teens off the apartment property, at this point I wasn't too sure what his plan was.Anyway, these two teens, apparently impressed by being treated with respect, offered to fight my landlord on my behalf. Welp, I declined obviously. But here I am with three intoxicated people looking to fight, I'm not sure there was anything I could do to prevent violence. I tried, I really did. Asked the teens to respect me as I had respected them, and leave in peace... which was hard to around the landlords threats and demands to leave. And they might have, had the LL been less abusive, abrasive, and, frankly, already itching for a fight. So, one of the teens asked for a smoke from the landlord, who was smoking, which escalated to a demand, which escaleted to, and I shit you not, "give me your wallet". And that point the landlord popped the one closest to him, I put myself between the active fight and the other guy, who advanced on me without hesitation so I took him down with a quick chokehold. He tapped out within seconds so I, figuring the fight was out of him, let him go and get back up. I turned around and bent over to see if I could find my glasses in the dark, and thanks to the noise from the other guys, I didn't hear the little shit approach. While bent over he kicked me full force dead center of my face. I stood up and make the observation that if someone doesn't go down after eating the best shot they could possibly give perhaps they picked a fight with the wrong people. That was when I started to get angry, and as soon as I took a step towards him he bolted. Around this time the other teen was begging for my landlord to stop pounding him (think his braces got smashed up pretty good, the LL didn't pull his punches at all), and the cops pulled up, not sure who called em. My glasses were broken because instead of tryin to hurt that guy I tried to restrain him, they fell to the ground when I opted to grapple instead of strike, and got stepped on in the aftermath.The plus of all this is that I got a skateboard one of them left behind I'm gonna sell and put towards my glasses, and I think me and the LL have taken a few steps towards resolving our own differences. I told him afterwards that I wasn't gonna let him get two manned (even if they were more boys than men), and he said the same thing. Feel pretty stupid though, had the demand for my landlords wallet registered properly at the time I doubt I would have been so... soft. I think my glasses and face would both be intact.TLDR - Almost fought with landlord, then fought with landlord against two teens. Got my glasses, and perhaps nose, broken by trying be merciful to thieves that lack the capacity to recognize or appreciate how hard I tried to avoid harming them.Update - the kid that kicked me and ran away was waiting outside my apartment this morning. He was trying to apologize for last night, but I was pretty angry. He had another skateboard with him, so I took it and told him it was to pay for my glasses. Also told him be was damned lucky I didn't pound him out or call the cops. He asked how much it would take to get his boards back, and I told him I'd accept 50$. He went and got it, paid me, and I gave his boards back. Kudos to him for manning up and facing me, that took balls, but when I suggested he take the lessons to heart and not start fights with adults, or anyone, he replied he was a fighter, and my response was 'no, you're a loser'. He walked away without another word. At least I made a couple bucks, because I'm pretty sure I can get my glasses fixed for less. Despite his words, I really hope the kid learned something.

378r1o	-13482	1432584904	Assistance	I seem to be unemployable... but I have a bit of an idea to generate my own work	I have little patience for being told what to do, less so when I know what I am doing. Recently I was working for this roofing company where I had to take orders from the bosses son... while teaching him how to do the job (I even had to teach him how to read a tape measure). And after I, literally, did 90% of the work I was paid less than 10% of the profit on the job. I'm not much a roofer, certainly not good enough to be confident in taking on jobs replacing people homes on my own, and really feel the company I was last working for *certainly* should not have taken such contracts. The company took a lot of my time, paid modestly and daily, and when I ran out of patience for them wasting 5 hours of my time they refused to pay for I didn't have enough to cover more than my rent and insurance. I actually had less money when I stopped working for these guys than when I started.Anyway... I did recently learn how to properly do moss removal from people's homes. It is pretty straightforward, and there isn't a lot I need to get started. A chemical sprayer is about the only thing I actually need. Eventually I'll want a blower to speed things up (but can use a rake and broom to get started), and a ladder to seem more professional (but I wager most homeowners will have one available until I get one). The scrub brushes I need are pretty cheap, so the only thing really holding me back is the chemical sprayer.There are certainly a lot of people in more desperate situations than I, and without any assistance I should be able to proceed with this plan within a month or so anyway (with just a little luck), but I am pretty close to self sufficiency I think. A little push to help me stand on my own... and maybe I will be in a position to offer a hand up to someone else sooner. The sprayer costs about a hundred bucks plus tax, and I'd need a little float to buy chemical and brushes for my first job. And after that first job I will have the means to stay above water... and perhaps have blundered enough in the past to do it right this time. I will be more than happy to work out a way to pay any assistance back, with interest, but I lack the credit for a business loan, and just need this to get started on my own.Thanks if anyone helps, and thanks if not.PS - Mods, I have filled out that form during a prior, unanswered, request.

So even as I learned more about her, and logically concluded she was probably bad news, I decided to trust my gut this time. She asked me out, and I said as long as she stays clean. Where she was living was a flop house, and just bad news all around. So I immediately offered to move her in (way too fast, but she needed to get out of there). While I was moving her stuff, or more accurately, during a break we took to chat, the property supervisor (fat fuck) had my truck towed.I reported it stolen, starting askng around to get a description, and found out it was towed. Asked fat fuck why, and he (presumably thinking I was one of the people that have been causing problems around there despite this being my first visit there) started screaming at me to leave and threatening me. Well, I don't back down, and when I approached him, with my arms at my side, to explain threating me will not get him anywhere his equally fat wife jumped (not literally) between us and starting bumpng me with her fat gut, distracting me so fat fuck could grab me from behind and basically fall on me. I managed to get out from under his bulk, though my face and knees both hit the pavement hard (I look like I had my ass kicked), and by then there were four more people ready to back up fat fuck, so I didn't get to pay him back for my injuries.Cops showed up, refused to press charges, though they did manage to get me my truck back without any fees. If they hadn't I would not have been able to get it back at all, am broke. About this time I found out the girl misunderstood something I said during the chat just before I noticed my truck gone, and rather than letting me clarify she said she was staying at a friends and would talk to me tomorrow. Then she went back inside while I finished with the police. And afterwards, wouldn't answer the door for me. Then I went to finalize a deal I'd been working on all week with a chap that was gonna invest in my modest business proposal (1000 bucks to start a moss removal company), and when he saw my injuries he backed out because obviously I get into trouble and would be a risky investment.TLDR - Almost lost my truck, lost some skin off my face and knees, lost my chance at my own business, and presumably lost the girl (though this one may not be a loss)... because I tried to move a meth head that wanted a fresh start into a house that is clean and safe.

3fq5ve	-13482	1438678078	FFRecordKeeper	Just found this game. Love it... just wish it would run properly	Playing on a LG G3 (android I think), and it runs like crap. Nothing scrolls, and it has to load between every action. I play deadmans cross, which I'm sure has higher requirements, and it runs flawlessly.I tried all the fixes I saw. Forcing 2d gpu. Previous version of ffrk. Un updated and rolled back that web thing. Various combinations of the three. The only way the game is even half way playable is with none of the fixes, each one seems to make it worse.Hope I can find a solution. I really like this game.As an aside... just how fortunate should I feel to pull a 5* golden shield on my first relic hunt?

Just took out rapps on the event thing. Had no problem vetting to him, taking 200-300 damage a hit, then I get to rapps and BOOM! 3000 damage a hit.

3h04kl	-13482	1439575254	FFRecordKeeper	70 stamina later, I find the boss entirely unbeatable	I have had some hilarious luck with the relic draw. Spears and axes from ffV, and some armor too. Yay. Enough to make a javelin++, and still have a couple extras. Nothing better than a giant axe though. Anyway, figured I'd try to get lenna since white mage is so frail, and I have only been able to draw ffv shit. I could one shot all the trash, figured I was a shoe in. Then buddy boy, boss guy, one shotted each of my guys. Even after power breaking I couldn't keep up with his damage, even if he didn't start with my healer, who couldn't survive a shot even power broken.I've commented before on the difficulty gap between bosses and trash, but this is ridiculous. If I'm not tough enough to even threaten the boss, why are the enemies along the way somch weaker than me? And the numbers don't seem to mean crap, I've mastered levels with difficulties over 50, this place is 41 (I think).Really wish the enemies along the way were some indication if you were in over your head...

3i158p	-13482	1440292278	FFRecordKeeper	Well, I was having fun.	In spite of my absurd luck with rare relic pulls (~200 mithril since I started, one gold shield), I have been having great fun. Until last night. Suddenly the next progress quest, cave on the veldt in ffvi is outta my league. Even with 3 characters with RS, almost entirely VI gear, and leveled gear, I'm geting one shotted by trash. I have cloud at 50, aeris, sabin, edgar, and sabin in their high 30s. The char with my gold shield takes 2 hits, usually.So then I figured I'd start shopping around for lower end elites I could handle. Oh, mt kolts. That's 30 lower than where I just got sent packing from (and I owe him for stopping my progress during the brothers event whn I started). His wind slash drops 4 chars. And even before I madeitto him those birds were one shotting anyone with their dive. So, sure, maybe with a defensive RW I may have a chance a surviving the wind slash, if it happens when I have defenses up, and I have enough charges to last the fight... but being one second and one lucky shot away from a wipe is not fun.Maybe if I had pulled better gear I could progress further, but having barely managed to clear my last couple missions, and getting stopped cold anywhere new I go, I think I'm pretty close to packing this one in. Love the nostalgia, and variety of gear and chars... but I'm not speding money to progress.I'm familiar with the strategies, I've done a fair bit of research... but there is no planning in the world that will help when your attacks are mosquito bites and the other guy's can smear you across the floor.So, yeah. Not having fun any more. Just frustrating. I probably woulda already uninstalled it if I hadn't drawn a 5* from the common draw (that's how bad my rare draws have been, I got better equipment from the common draw), and got a couplechars from prior events. But I'm not gonna fall victim to the investment fallacy.I'll walk away from this for awhile, see if I can have fun again at a later date. And if not, this games fan base will be minus 1.

d09oq	-13500	1281598667	lost	Just started Lost.. is it worth it to continue watching after Season 1?	I just finished Season 1 of Lost on Netflix - watched all 25 episodes over 5 days or so. It's a well-written show and I've enjoyed watching it.However, I've noticed that the show follows a strict formula, and over the course of 25 episodes it became a bit tiresome to watch it. For one, mystery is constantly generated but never addressed or resolved (e.g. the numbers, the hatch, the "monster", Ethan, the "others" and how they want babies, forest whispers, Rousseau and her expedition, the transmission source, the black smoke plume, polar bears, Locke seeing light in the hatch, Locke getting a first-hand view of the monster, the smoky creatures, Locke's dreams, murmurings of the crew being "chosen", etc, etc). I think mystery is fine to drive events forward, but frankly, it's underwhelming when it's left unaddressed. It feels like either the screenwriters themselves didn't know what would happen, or that they were trying to prolong the series as much as possible.Second, and this is related, but toward the end of the season there were a lot of filler episodes. I really liked the beginning of the 1st season because it had great momentum, but toward the end, many episodes consisted of somewhat irrelevant/redundant backstory (e.g. the finale - watching Charlie during his junkie days for the umpteenth time, watching Michael clash w/ Walt yet again, etc). Also, at the end of the 1st season there were only "false scares". For example, in the final episode, Claire's baby is stolen by Rousseau which leads to a long chase, which ultimately leads to Rousseau just giving the baby back to Sayid. Third, with the exception of Sawyer and perhaps Jin, few characters saw development at the end of the season. It's as if there's nothing more that can be revealed about the crew. Charlie's still old Charlie - gets hot-headed and yearns for heroin and Claire. Hurley's still Hurley - happy-go-lucky and all-too-willing to tell everyone to "chill out". Jack's still driven to save *everyone* (except red shirts like Arzt, who was blown up) and Kate is still torn between being committed and running away from her troubles. I mean, will more complexities arise in the later seasons, or will all the characters play to their types?I know all this complaining sounds like I didn't like it; quite the contrary, though - I really enjoyed watching the 1st season. After watching the underwhelming season finale, however (where nothing gets resolved but the mystery is simply prolonged), I don't know if I can bear being dragged along for another season..

n63ne	-13500	1323424998	tipofmytongue	[TOMT][poem] Featured in 2006 SAT II Literature test.	I took the SAT II Literature test in fall '06 (I believe), and there was a poem therein that I found poignant, and I've been searching for its name ever since...I hope I have it all correct, but this is merely how I remember it.Basically, there are a bunch of adults from a neighborhood sitting in a living room (after church?). All the children are outside, playing or something. As the adults sit there, the sun sets and it grows dark in the room, but no one moves or does anything (perhaps out of lethargy?). Finally, the children come inside and turn on the lights, which moves the adults from their stupor. If I remember correctly, the light sort of represented youthful naivete whereas the darkness represented the knowing that age brings.

n84f3	-13500	1323575444	TOMTcoldcase	[TOMTcc][POEM] Featured in 2006 SAT II Literature test.	I took the SAT II Literature test in fall '06 (I believe), and there was a poem therein that I found poignant, and I've been searching for its name ever since...I hope I have it all correct, but this is merely how I remember it.Basically, there are a bunch of adults from a neighborhood sitting in a living room (after church?). All the children are outside, playing or something. As the adults sit there, the sun sets and it grows dark in the room, but no one moves or does anything (perhaps out of lethargy?). Finally, the children come inside and turn on the lights, which moves the adults from their stupor. If I remember correctly, the light sort of represented youthful naivete whereas the darkness represented the knowing that age brings. I believe the most important contrasts here were youth/old-age, light/darkness, and innocence/wisdom.I'll be shocked if someone knows it! I do a pretty thorough Google search every now and then... Thanks!
r3ohj	-13500	1332177354	tipofmytongue	[TOMT][video game] NES-era (8-bit) motorcycle videogame where, when damaged, you explode and them reassemble	NES-era (8-bit - probably on the NES, but can't remember for sure) motorcycle videogame. I believe it takes place in a Mad Max sort of post-apocalyptic wasteland; the camera is positioned behind the rider. Notably, when damaged (your character and his bike), it explodes, then the explosion freezes and rewinds on itself, reassembling whole againI believe the character was featured as a collectible trophy in one of the Super Smash Bros. games
1a79o4	-13500	1363154760	Illustration	Thinking of pursuing illustration or something design-related in the future. Is my stuff any good? Critiques welcome!	http://imgur.com/a/xXCRVThese are my most recent drawings. Ive always been interested in design and drawing but have just started dabbling in illustration as a creative outlet. Think I have (or might have in the future) what it takes to hack it in illustration? Ive never taken a real art class in my life except painting in high school and so I know I'm weak in a lot of areas (im currently in law school actually...) but i feel like i learn something new every time I draw something. More importantly, I really love drawing- I would happily do it all day long. Also, is it worth it to enroll in an illustration program? Whenever i look at good illustrators online or even in my area, it seems like they all went to a select handful of schools (eg, sva, pratt, etc). Ive heard that successful illustrators need not go to art school, but I don't know many who haven't. If I went would Ilearn lots of stuff I wouldn't be able to pick up on the street?Thanks for looking and for your advice!

I really want to find more movies like this.What do I mean by atmospheric? I mean one of the dir's primary goals was to establish a "mood" or "feeling" even to a fault (eg, "Tree of Life" focuses on atmosphere perhaps to the extent that it detracts from being coherent).What do I mean by visually beautiful? Lots of movies are good-looking, but I like movies where the *primary* goal was to look visually amazing - where every shot is perfectly designed (eg, "Tron Legacy" is a fantasy example of this, "The Master" is a real world example of this).What do I mean by "features OST prominently" or "soundtrack at forefront"? Well, I guess, first I prefer atmospheric soundtracks. Eg, "Magnolia" might be well-integrated brilliantly with its OST (think of when the characters all start singing the Aimee Mann song as if in a music video). And eg, "Almost Famous" (Tiny Dancer scene). But I'm looking more for OSTs that are "atmospheric" if that makes any sense - "atmospheric" meaning the OST propels the mood of the scene without stumbling into the limelight. Think of "Tron Legacy," "Lost in Translation," "Traffic," "The Fountain," "Requiem for a Dream," "Drive," etc.I know this is all kind of vague, but I think of other people have the same preferences they'll know *exactly* what I'm talking about and hopefully be able to recommend similar movies. Thanks a lot!!

1uespo	-13500	1388866604	criterion	How long will blu rays be the dominant format for Criterion?	I made the decision to replace all my Criterion DVDs w/ blu rays earlier this year - it was an arduous process, and I'm still missing many titles (eg, still haven't found last year at marienbad in blu ray). It seems like Criterion is really investing into blu ray currently. Pretty much every new release is in blu ray, and they're consistently refreshing old spine numbers in blu ray.Criterion is also doing everything in digital formats; however, the blu rays currently have better quality, and I think they're much better for film collectors since it comes in a nice package.At the sony store the other day, I saw a 4K setup. The picture quality was *clearly* superior to what I've seen from my blu rays. However, I don't know too much about 4K, and I don't know what 4K means for Criterion releases.So I'm wondering whether Blu Ray will continue to be the dominant format for Criterion releases, or if there'll be something else in a few years where I'll have to replace my collection again.

2ch37h	-13500	1407035821	bicycling	Is it worth it to upgrade my bike?	I recently bought this bike (2006 Raleigh Cadent 3.0) off of Craigslist, which is my first 'real' bike:http://www.bikepedia.com/quickbike/BikeSpecs.aspx?year=2006&amp;brand=Raleigh&amp;model=Cadent+3The first thing I upgraded was the saddle - to a top-of-the-line Specialized saddle. Next, I'm going to put some new pedals on. And then I'm going to upgrade the handlebars, stem, and get some nice bar tape.These are all 'fit' upgrades, more or less, although it's also for aesthetic purposes and just to make the bike nicer. But I'm thinking about eventually upgrading other components to high-end components over time. For example, at some point, I'd like to upgrade the seat post, the crank, the rims, the headset, etc.I know this bike isn't especially nice or anything. Would upgrading these components on the bike, with its relatively low-end frame, even be worth it? I'm thinking that if I switch to a better frame in the future, I can just carry all of the components over.
2iyr81	-13500	1413053640	Watches	[Shinola] Just a fashion watch?	Shinola watches have been in the back of my mind ever since I first saw them displayed at various high-end stores over the past couple years. How could they not? Shinola makes an undeniably good looking watch, and the company’s branding and presentation is sexy and luxurious in addition to uplifting and feel-good, with its not-accidental social cause message. To me, Shinola feels like a high-end Timex Weekender meets Toms shoes. People say, “Just wear what you like, what makes you feel good.” But at the same time, there’s a reason why no one wants to end up with just a “fashion watch.”Getting a watch is kind of like getting a car. You want to choose it carefully since, for most people, you’ll have just one daily-driver, even if you can afford multiple. The styling and looks of a car are obviously important, and so too are the appointments, such as leather seats and what not. But ultimately, everyone knows that what’s under the hood is what’s going the matter at the end of the day. Is the car reliable? How does it drive, and under different conditions? Like with a watch, and its internal movement, the looks of a car can only satisfy you to a certain extent. This is why any amount of research into watches will yield “get a watch with a respectable movement.”I say this because Shinola have great looks and design, not to mention high-end parts such as stainless steel cases, sapphire crystals, Horween straps, etc. But when it comes to a watch, this is all window-dressing to the heart and soul of it, the movement.Shinola exclusively uses quartz movements, the province of fashion watches, athletic watches, and entry-level watches from brands even including Omega. This basically makes Shinola the Nixon watch for guys who prefer Red Wing and Filson, and who subscribe to Americana sartorial blogs. It’s for guys who want shoes made from cordovan leather and handmade in the USA, but where the upper is glued to the sole. In other words, a semblance of craftsmanship that disregards actual craftsmanship and heritage. Having a quartz movement means that, for better or for worse, Shinola will never be respected by watch people, or watch snobs, whichever you prefer.So, with Shinola, what we have is a great looking battery-powered watch. But that’s not all, because of course, the most important thing about Shinola is that it’s made in USA.Made in Detroit, specifically. And you can’t forget it, because Shinola’s feel-good social cause fashion goes part and parcel with the brand’s identity. Shinola’s meticulous branding and marketing makes the brand criticism-proof (you obviously don’t point out flaws of a product made by the hard-working downtrodden, but full of potential, folks from this city) but also allow it tap into a fountain of old-timey, vintage, artisinal imagery that’s currently in vogue. I could delve into Shinola’s history with Fossil, but even if it were true, who cares? Every so-called “heritage” brand is associated with a corporate conglomerate. Instead, I’d like to focus on Shinola’s disingenuous marketing and branding.Shinola’s marketing and branding simply feels off. And by “off,” I mean false and pretending. Now, every company champions its heritage, real or imagined, because people simply like to buy things that have a story. With cars, for example, you don’t pretend to have a history in championship racing if you don’t. See Lexus and its huge racing investment for marketing purposes. The same goes for watches. Omega didn’t pretend to put a watch on the moon. Hamilton didn’t pretend to be the official military-issue watch. And so when Omega comes out with a outer space-spec watch, or when Hamilton comes out with a military watch, there’s a legitimacy there, and people like that. And when they market and brand their watches in accordance, it’s true to the company history.Everything about Shinola is meticulously designed to evoke something that feels imagined. From its shoe-shine namesake, to its product branding with names such as “Runwell” that belie the quartz movement inside, to its Detroit assembled but actually Swiss made componentry. Shinola ran a tounge-in-cheek ad that Geneva would soon be known as the Detroit of watchmaking. Supposed to be a joke, I know, but if you have even a rudimentary understanding of how hard it is to make a high-end mechnical movement, it becomes less funny and more preposterous. Another Shinola ad states that “the long tradition of Detroit watchmaking has just begun.” Really? I’m pretty sure that to even write the first page of the first chapter in your book on watchmaking, you have to actually design a watch movement, not just put a bunch of parts together. Switzerland isn't the capital of watchmaking because they took Chinese parts and put them together. And yet Shinola's slogan is currently "watchmaking capital of America."Would I ever get a Shinola? Maybe. Shinola hit a home run with the design on its first try. And like everyone else, I buy things for fashion - but watches are different. For me, this seems like a brand that’s talking the talk but not walking the walk. I think putting an automatic movement inside is, necessarily, the first step toward becoming an actual legitimate watch brand. And if Shinola wants to legitimize their marketing, well, I think they'll actually have to use a USA made movement.Until then, Shinola strikes me as a decent story in search of an actual product.
2okulx	-13500	1417984615	TrueFilm	Literalism and Nightcrawler	*Nightcrawler* is an interesting commentary on a range of eclectic themes - the unwholesomeness of the news cycle, the dark nature of ambition in corporate America today, and the irony of how pure evil and corruption presents itself in a friendly, benign manner. Most of all, *Nightcrawler* creates a character. Lou Bloom is less a character, actually, than a caricature, representing the utmost extreme of the unhealthy ideals that, the film argues, drive America today. Yet because *Nightcrawler* is so strikingly literal in the way it presents these things, it fails both as a piece of art and in meaningfully conveying its ideas.I’d like to break down what I perceive to be the literalism in *Nightcrawler* and why it both makes the film less watchable and entertaining than it could have been, in addition to less meaningful and thought-provoking.I should add that I found many admirable things in *Nightcrawler*, but that its significant missteps and overabundance of literalism and willingness to talk down to the audience seriously detracted from it.**LOU BLOOM**Gyllenhaal turns in a fine performance here as Lou Bloom, and his performance will be remembered for years. But the character Lou Bloom won’t be remembered for the same reason *Nightcrawler* won’t be remembered - it is drawn only in bold strokes with little to no detail, and is merely the representation of extreme, simplistic ideas. Simply put, Lou Bloom is the idea of how sociopathy drives America, especially in the corporate world. *Nightcrawler* repeatedly drives this point home by having Lou Bloom speak (nearly exclusively!) in corporate successism platitudes and by showing how he treats every aspect of his personal and professional life with a predatory corporate takeover mentality. The film fails to show contrasting dimensions to Lou Bloom’s character, such as sympathy or weakness, instead opting to make Lou Bloom an unstoppable juggernaut whose ambition and go-getter attitude take him to the top. Of course, he makes it there, to the top, and at the film’s conclusion, *Nightcrawler* comes full-circle with its literalism by having Lou Bloom face the camera, speaking directly to the audience (by way of Lou Bloom’s new recruits to his company), because, of course, you are working under Lou Bloom, and the shot of Lou Bloom’s multiple cargo vans driving away shows the foundation of business in America, and unless you weren’t literally shown this, it would’ve gone over your head.Patrick Bateman in *American Psycho* offers a three-dimensional portrayal of sociopathy - the film argues that it is accompanied by personal and professional demise as well as inner torment. *American Psycho* cleverly showed you the inner torment, of course, by way of his fantasy universe where he couldn’t satiate his reckless bloodthirst. And *American Psycho* was also fond of Bateman’s internal soliloquies (“I simply am not there”). *Nightcrawler* opts instead to make Lou Bloom a one-dimensional portrayal of sociopathy - not so much a person with feelings and thoughts, but a force we’re all familiar with from corporate life in America. Unfortunately, despite Lou Bloom being staunchly based in reality, he is less relatable than Patrick Bateman, for example, because he’s simply not a person but rather a manifestation of misanthropy with no internal monologue.Lou Bloom is an opportunist, yes, and he has qualities we all have, as I mentioned above, in the final scene, echoing the final scene in *Wolf of Wall Street* where he addresses the audience. But without adding any discernible human element, *Nightcrawler* weakens the character by simply turning him into an unrelatable idea.**TONAL IRONY**Lou Bloom is but one example of how literalism in *Nightcrawler* weakens the film overall. *Nightcrawler* uses extremely obvious tonal irony to literally instead of subtly convey ideas to the audience.The most obvious of all is James Newton Howard’s score. JN Howard is of course a highly experienced Hollywood composer who regularly turns in scores for high-profile blockbusters. He is by no means, however, influential or noteworthy, beyond perhaps his reliability and prolificiness. JN Howard is the guy who provides a Hollywood score of adequate quality within one month’s time if the producers need him. I’m saying that he isn’t Thomas Newman or Hans Zimmer, but he knows how to create a score that “sounds like” what the producers say they want it to sound like.This is important to note because *Nightcrawler* makes the very conscpicuous choice to have JN Howard turn in a score that is light, airy, and almost bubbly. Seriously, despite *Nightcrawler* depicting dark events with a an equally dark aesthetic, the score is full of light strings and mallet instruments. Obviously, *Nightcrawler* makes the score as upbeat and generic as the corporate platitudes that Lou Bloom spouts off, to further juxtapose Lou Bloom’s go-getter worldview with the sinister ramifications that transpire.Needless to say, it is unnecessary to have this jarring clash with the score when the film is already being as obvious and literal as it is. The score is one of the most important parts of a filmviewing experience, and *Nightcrawler* opts to spend the score on further driving home a point on literal irony. In addition to that, the score simply isn’t very good, which we can assume was not an intentional choice.**OTHER STYLISTIC CHOICES**There are dozens of other minor things that show how *Nightcrawler* holds the viewer’s hand in understanding the film’s relativity simplistic ideas. Lou Bloom’s late model cherry red sports car. The fact that Lou Bloom literally lives in a one-room apartment with a TV centered in the middle of it. Rene Russo’s character essentially being the news world analogue of Lou Bloom. *Nightcrawler* essentially presents everything so plainly, and in such black-and-white fashion, that it’s really not a movie inviting you think about its ideas. It’s a movie telling you what to think about its ideas. *Nightcrawler* is not revolutionary in its ideas either - this is well trodden ground - *American Psycho*, *Wolf of Wall Street*, *Up in the Air*, and so forth. I should add that the movie, aesthetically, was somewhat unmemorable and workmanlike. Obviously, shooting in LA at night is by default going to yield some decent images, but comparing it to say, *Drive*, there was little oomph in the way of visuals. This might be altogether unrelated to the larger piece I've written here, since unlike the score, it probably wasn't a thematic decision, and therefore I won't dwell on it.

You would start off at different places, have to meet up to combine tools and resources to move forward, activate different or same things/doors, draw the alien away from your friend as he has to do some noisy things, can't talk too loud to each other if the alien is near...

2sqmre	-13510	1421509432	alienisolation	(Spoilers) From the artbook on how the alien operates.	Last chance to close your eyes. No?"The alien can hear, see light and movement and is aware of multiple targets at once," says Lead Designer Gary Napper. "It starts by exploring an area for any signs of movement or sounds but does not follow a prescribed path. At this point it isn't even looking for the player, just signs of any target. When it hears or sees something, it narrows its search to the area that it has detected something within. From then on it reacts to what it is seeing depending on the target and their actions. This of course is just its low level behavior and any more would spoil the magic"Let the experiments begin.

Died right after a save on mission 6 and reloaded current and played on, but I have since replayed the whole mission w/o dying as some ppl said the trophy should pop, but no :(

So John Cena goes on about being real and being honorable and resepect and blah blah blah and then he accepts a victory when CM Punk's foot was obviously on the ropes. So if John Cena does it it's just desserts; but Punk legit draws in the match at NOC with Cena and he's supposed to be the heel? Does this irk anyone else? The audience tonight was great btw.
14a91e	-13524	1354658347	SquaredCircle	How CM Punk could not vacate his title	So with the procedure that Punk had he could possibly be back within 30 days; which traditionally has been the length of time a Champion can go without defending the title. I'm sure at a recent house show he defended the title and they can start the count from there. He can come out; be interviewed, claiming that he has the right to defend AT the 30 day mark and they can't take the belt until then. It would be a way to continue to garner him heat while giving them time to figure out where they can go and see if Punk can heal up.

36r9tg	-13524	1432218027	SquaredCircle	Kevin Owens is Walter White...	I was thinking about this while watching Unstoppable last night. I apologize if this has already been discussed, but I don't remember this being brought up. Take the Meth out of the equation to start of course. I think Kevin Owens, the cheered for mega-heel, is totally in the vain of a Walter White character. He does things that people really like and goes after some people the IWC finds detestable, but don't be fooled he's definitely not a good guy. (kayfabe of course) He also always claims that his actions are being done for his family, he's attacking people violently FOR HIS FAMILY. I won't spoil Breaking Bad for anyone, but Walter uses this line to justify to himself and others that what he is doing is always justified for the majority of the series.  Was interested if anyone else sees it at all or even thought of it.

Also get ride of you linking books first they crash your game if the age they go to doesn't exist.

23q1fh	-13552	1398209639	MechanicalKeyboards	[help] I am working on designing a gaming keypad and I could use some advice	I am currently designing a keypad similar to the bekin n52, razer orbweaver but for 8 of the switches I will using hall-effect sensors and magnets similar to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEwDImE0DU4) too get an analogue output.  I plan on using red switches for the keys I convert to analogue and browns for the rest but I am currently looking for the best place to but a small number of switches (8 red, 22 brown) and I'n not sure what key caps would be best to get.  I saw that http://mechanicalkeyboards.com/ sells keys in groups of 5, and 50 but I would prefer to spend less money and only get as many keys as I need. with respect to the key switches I know that caps for each row of of keys on a keyboard are slightly different and am considering getting a custom set of key caps from wasd http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/ and using the keys to make two sets of keycaps for my keypad, though I'm not sure if standard keyboard keycapsl be the right, also would find a set of caps what look nice with leds but that is probably something I will have to give up.Here are some pictures of my very rough design, the blue and green keys will be the ones I make analogue.http://i.imgur.com/qGmeRqu.pnghttp://i.imgur.com/5LQM3Y3.jpgThe reason I am making this is go I can have a keypad with analogue input for 6-dof control in star citizen.

I've been trying to print key switch holders and my printer has been clogging almost every time with the plastic coiling up between the entrance to the hot end and the stepper motor, I think it is due to the rapid extrudes and retracts as the printer infills the thin walls, is there anyway I can edit my printing properties to stop this?pictures of my failed prints http://i.imgur.com/s7jnaQ0.jpghttp://i.imgur.com/Zi83KhI.jpgUPDATE: It seems that I fixed it, by taking a big fan and pointing it at the hot end the print quality shot way up.  I'm petty sure by now the reason I was having issues was that my extruder was heating up the plastic to the point that it was malleable and it was buckling under the force rather then going into the hot end, leading to the clog at the top of the backend.  Now I'm back printing http://i.imgur.com/wQABGYz.jpg Thanks all for the help.

However, the other day she had the hiccups and I off-handedly mentioned an article I'd read (probably on reddit) about how hiccups may be a vestigial reflex left over from when we were fish and had to move water through our gills.  She was like, "yeah, except I don't think we were ever fish."  I was floored and responded, "Wait, you don't believe in evolution???"  She goes, "Well, just not the fish part."  Me: "So the monkey bit is ok?"  Her: "Yeah, but it's too long a conversation to have right now."  And then she walks away.  WHAT?  I was left very confused by the whole thing.  Has anyone else ever heard of this thinking?  Why would it be not ok to have evolved from fish but ok to have evolved from apes?

10y0kf	-13560	1349370648	PoliticalDiscussion	TL;DR of Obama's budget plan	**Disclaimer- this is not complete!**  Obama’s plan is SIGNIFICANTLY longer (200+ pages) than Romney's, and I’ve covered the issues that appear to be the most important to people (a la redditor [hurrayforzac](http://www.reddit.com/user/hurrayforzac), who covered Romney’s plan).  I am also an amateur at political science and have injected a few of my own opinions in here, so I strongly urge you to read through these budgets and make your own decisions!  Hopefully this makes it a little easier, though.Main ideas:* Cutting spending on non-essential govt programs, including some that the administration states “will take not only eliminating ineffective and duplicative programs, but also cutting worthy programs that the Administration would otherwise fund were it not for the tight fiscal environment.”* Examples: eliminating federal EPA programs (such as clean water and asbestos-removal initiatives) and allowing states to take these over.  The justification is that the programs have been in place so long, the individual states are basically running them anyway.* Elimination of spending for indirect expenses in health care and health care training, i.e. covering the cost of tuition during medical students’ in-hospital training, but not compensating the individual hospitals for decreased/slower services due to needing to train the students.* Cutting private-sector incentives (like Clean Automotive Technology) and allowing similar govt programs to take over the research (there is a Vehicles Technology program already in place).* Cuts to non-clean energies such as coal, fossil energy R&amp;D, and lots of cuts to agriculture since this sector is considered “strong” despite the bad economy.* Sadly, cuts to several technology and science programs, but this was considered justified in that many of the goals of these programs had been met.* Happily, TONS of cuts to military spending.  This may not sit well w/ a lot of people, but the cuts that are proposed are things such as decreasing the physical size of the military (less soldiers which is inevitable anyway with pulling out of Afghanistan), decreasing training of deputized and armed pilots on commercial aircraft, cutting funding for drones not currently in high production, and crazy experimental weapons.* Elimination of funding for the National Drug Intelligence Center (first step toward legalizing recreational drugs!).* Cuts to highly-specific federal assistance programs (to be consolidated), which I’m sure my right-leaning readers are excited about.  This includes decreased spending on govt-subsidised housing for the disabled.* Govt will no longer take over defaulted student loans.  This will instead be the responsibility of the guaranty agency (Fannie Mae, etc), decreasing fines.The plan also outlines (with many helpful charts) consolidation of several loose and duplicate programs to reduce overall spending.  This includes federal highway programs, immigration departments, higher education funding, and of course healthcare reform.* The Federal Highways Program will take 55 individual categories and consolidate into 5 new programs: National Highway (budgeting/upkeep), Safety, Livability (pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly), Research, Technology &amp; Education, and Federal Allocation (emergency relief and special considerations).*Integrated Resource Restoration: decommissioning of over 2,000 miles of roads, the restoration or enhancement of 2,750 miles of stream habitat, and 2,800 million board feet of timber sold.* Implementation of the First in the World Program (FITW) to create a more competitive education environment and consolidate special ed programs.* Decreasing the number of regional offices for the Department of Labor.* Streamlining the Department of Homeland Security because it’s a fucking mess.* No more staying in school forever to prevent interest from accruing as interest will start to accrue if students don’t complete their program within 150% the allotted time (in other words, if you are in a 4-year program, and it takes you over 6 years, you’re going to start paying interest while still in school).The savings proposed will come from several areas:* Focuses on reducing waste by improving use of technology (i.e. less paper used and more electronically formatted forms that will be available through govt websites), and decreasing spending on silly things such as “extraneous promotional items” such as plaques for fancy offices.* Program integrity:  making sure people fuck up less often.  This has made it a lot more difficult for people to commit Medicare fraud as the consequences have become more severe (believe me, I’ve had to sit through a HIPAA presentation every year for the last 3 years!).* Emphasis on reducing health-care costs by reducing the number of uninsured who get “free” healthcare at the expense of the states.  By implementing “Obamacare” a.k.a. the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act, many govt-funded health programs become obsolete and funding is reallocated to cover those who are exempt from the actual “buying” of insurance.**TLDR of my TLDR: Obama’s budget emphasises reducing govt waste and increasing savings and has specific plans within it to achieve these goals.**
11im6k	-13560	1350317943	TrueAtheism	Since when did Atheist = Evil Communist Regime?	I had an annoying experience on facebook this morning. I posted a link about the Muslim protests at Google (the entitled attitude of "free speech only for me!" etc.) and the slippery slope that leads to violence.  I ended it with "you won't see any atheists beheading people despite being openly mocked and persecuted all around the world...."Well, a Christian "friend" of mine posted this in response:"The Atheistic Chinese Communist Party does not tolerate religion. Due to its Marxist sympathies the Party simply eradicates those religious institutions that do not support its Communist agenda. Only those religious groups that support the Chinese Communist Party are allowed to exist. These institutions are made up of “puppet” religious leaders that promote the Communist Party. Religious leaders who do not follow the Chinese Communist Party are imprisoned or sent to labor camps or executed. Christians, Buddhists, and Muslims are all persecuted, or does that not matter? Or what about all the people murdered by the other Atheistic regimes? R.J. Rummel, estimates the total death toll in his book Death By Government:62.9 million in the Soviet Union32.9 million in the PRC while in power, plus an additional 3.5 million killed by the communist Chinese before taking control2 million in Cambodia1.7 million in Vietnam1.5 million post-WWII Poland1 million in Tito’s Yugoslaviaplus a suspected 1.6 million in North KoreaAll murdered by Atheists dictators because they disagreed with or mocked the Government."What are your thoughts on this?  I feel like I responded appropriately by drawing attention to the fact that it's more about getting rid of opposition to power than truly killing because of faith/religion.  Plus, that Poland argument is bullshit; Hitler and the Nazis were very proud of being Christian.  I just get really irritated with atheism continuing to be associated with horrible things like this and people trying to act like, "ooo, gotcha" when they bring this shit up.EDIT: formattingEDIT 2:  Thank you all so much for your input! :) EDIT 3: My response and his response.  Apologies for the lack of capitalization.  Also, yes, I realize I missed the "post" part in "post-WWII Poland," so that part is a little wonky.  My first response was written while waiting on this thread to fill up, and the second was using elements incorporated from the first few comments on here:**ME:** sigh, atheism in this case was simply a biproduct of communism. communists don't want any churches to interfere with the "fair" distribution of wealth. and since, communism doesn't actually work, it is more about getting rid of any possible opposition to the communist leader.this is a common mistake that people arguing against atheism make: atheism is not an organized religion. it doesn't have specific tenets, it is simply a word to describe the absence of belief in gods. which is silly, because we don't have words to describe the absence of belief in unicorns. but i digress...these regimes weren't beheading people because they were offended by religion, they were beheading people because they posed a threat to their power.your death toll example of poland, btw, is completely false. the nazis were hardcore christians, and used the bible to justify their persecutions of various groups. also, north koreans aren't atheists; they worship the "dear leader" of the time because he is essentially god to them. again, religion in that case is outlawed because it interferes w/ the dictator's absolute power."**HIM:** "the Nazis were NOT, I repeat, NOT hardcore Christians! Hitler wrote in Mein Kompf that Christianity was an obsolete religion that needed to be allowed to die off. Hitler and the Nazi leadership were instead followers of the ancient occult beliefs of pre-Christian Germany. You have to understand that Hitler only wanted things that were German. In his view, Christianity was nothing more than a spin off of Judaism and needed to be removed. However, Hitler knew he could not remove Christianity over night and so he ordered that the German church be twisted to suit his Aryan agenda. He removed all of the clergy and replaced them with Nazi clergy and even went so far as to rewrite the bible to preach the superiority of the Aryan race. Hitlers eventual goal would have been to merge the church with the ancient pagan Germanic beliefs. And the death toll in Poland is a post war total, in Communist Poland, after the Nazis were defeated.And speaking of Communist, whether atheism is a by product of communism or communism is a by product of atheism is irrelevant. The experience of the 20th century shows that the two go hand in hand. Karl Marx, who influenced these totalitarian states, was a staunch atheist and his Marxism was heavily influenced by his Atheism. So the two are intertwined. You can not have Communism, marxism, collectivism, etc. without Atheism. I completely agree that these totalitarian states removed "God" to protect their power. In a state where "God" does not exist, the state then assumes ultimate power. In the old Soviet Union or in modern China when someone is murdered for having religious items, it doesn't matter if it is motivate my Atheism or because of a threat to the state power, because the states power comes from the belief in Atheism.These statements are no more or less "hateful" than saying that religion is responsible for killing more people than than anything else. I admit that many atrocities have been carried out in the name "God" regardless of who's god we're talking about. However, I condemn all of these! That being said, I find saddening that many staunch Atheist can not except that fact the 20th century was by far the bloodiest century in human history and the vast majority of these atrocities were committed in the name of Atheistic regimes." *note: my fundie uncle "liked" this comment***ME:** "the facts support that religion is often used as a tool to incite violence. mass murders will kill people regardless of their religious leanings."In the old Soviet Union or in modern China when someone is murdered for having religious items, it doesn't matter if it is motivate my Atheism or because of a threat to the state power, because the states power comes from the belief in Atheism." - you don't seem to be understanding that there is no "belief" in atheism. this sentence doesn't even make sense. people are killed in crazy dictatorships because the dictators are crazy, not because they lack god in their lives.i think that this will hopefully get across what i'm trying to say. it seems useless to argue this with you since you insist that "atheistic regimes" are a thing the way theistic regimes are a thing. these people are not killing in the name of atheism, they just happen to want their people to worship no god other than themselves: [provided the JT Eberhardt link from spaceghoti]."So yeah, I got kind of tired of his rambling and copped out at the end there.  I get tired of having the same arguments with this guy over and over again (not the first time this has happened; dude is very stubborn and refuses to accept any new info aside from what he already firmly believes in his head).  These comments have been immensely helpful for the future, though, and it's been good to see everyone's different takes on things!

Three of those starters, Griffin, Milone, and Parker, are almost comparable to the early 2000's Big three of Zito, Mulder, and Hudson. There Bullpen is incredible, Cook and Balfour are both fantastic shutdown pitchers. To top it off they have the third best team ERA at 3.42. They may not have the most high powered offense, but 8 of their players have 10+ Homeruns (With Reddick leading the team at 28). They are tied 3rd in the AL for SB, and have won 9 in a row. There schedule is tough, but they have the third best record in the AL, and are only three games back from the Rangers in their division.

I conducted a 2 (symptom imagination) x 2 (message framing) independent measures design I would like to know whether my manipulations had the intended effect on participants. To check this in the study i asked 2 likert scale questions per IV (total 4) asking participants whether they thought the imagination task was easy/hard and how serious the symptoms seemed to them extremely serious/not at all serious, for the message framing i asked 2 questions asking what the tone of the messages were very negative – very positive and convincingness of  the messages shown : very convinced-totally unconvinced – all on a scale of 1-5. Im abit unsure about which test i would need to use to check whether the manipulations had the intended effect on people. Im thinking independent t-test but i can’t remember what the reasoning behind this test would be as i haven’t done a t-test in years: SIn spss what i have done so far is averaged the scores of each of the 2 questions in to one average score  so now i have an extra 2 variable columns in spss which show me these averaged scores.

While the Wii U's price went up by £100 upon release, i expect a drop of £100 in price for the Xbox One &amp; PS4 upon release. I know the retailers in Europe generally set the price for the console due to the EU law, so its going to be more expensive than other countries like the USA. Either way, it looks like i will again be holding out for 4-5 years for a PS4 when the price comes down. In the mean time i think ill just purchase a Wii U this summer when Pikmin 3 comes out in July for Europe. What do you guys/girls gamers think?

Hi all, ive been using the Freemake Video Converter to rip some of my DVDs to play on my smart tv as my DVD player is on its last legs. For the most part Freemake has been a blessing in letting me rip things how i want to, not for just DVDs put also converting things to use with my PS3 or phone. However recently ive run into a problem. For some anime series that i have, Freemake doesn't recognise the separate episodes when reading disks but instead combines all the episodes into one movie length video once read from the disk drive. Before when i have read and ripped disks in Freemake, i always had the option to select the individual episodes and create singe video files for each of them. But for some reason, Freemake wont allow me to do that anymore. At first i thought this might be the disk, but i got a brand new DVD boxset last week and still had the same problem with then new disks. I tried my other DVD disk drive and i still had the same problem :S However sometimes i have noticed Freemake when reading some disks, does occasionally read an odd episode in addition to combining all episodes into a single movie length file :sDoes anyone know what the problem might be? I will be emailing Freemake about this same issues shortly.Many ThanksTrilnk32

I was brought up a Sikh but in my teenage years i never took an interest in learning the language so i was never properly taught it. As a result i have broken punjabi from learning various phrases from my family around me. I think ive matured enough to know now that i want to learn Punjabi properly and understand how to pronounce words properly rather than guess. I also would like to be able to read/write Punjabi to enhance my overall understanding of the language to prepare myself for when i go to India later this yearIs there any good free software or resources that I could use to teach myself to write and speak Punjabi? I learn better from games, so if there are any interactive Punjabi games around that would be amazing. So far I have one book on how to learn to Punjabi in a month but it mostly covers basic phrasing and some conversational stuff. Its only a small stepping stone but i feel i need more resources if im to become a confident speaker/writer in Punjabi.Any help would be much appreciated.Many ThanksTrilink32

Up until Oerba i felt i knew the story pretty well and what direction it was heading in. However on my way back to Cocoon is when i get really confused about the story. Specifically Im still struggling to understand what happened in Chapter 12-13 after the Pulse creatures started invading Cocoon. I dont quite understand Dysley motives, what those guardians(not sure what else to call them) in the Tessaract were doing, or for that matter how the group came back from being Ceith :SIn short im hoping someone could explain what happened after the Pulse creatures invade Cocoon up until the point you defeat Orphan's 2nd form.This is the first time ive come away from a game not knowing quite what happened. So if someone could clear this up for me that would be fantastic, because Wikipedia is not useful in clearing these concerns i have :S (yes i have read the data logs but i still feel confused)

Hey everyone, after the avalanche of news from E3 this from all companies, i have an uneasy feeling there is a conspiracy against Nintendo. Everyone who watched the Direct saw how amazingly jaw dropping "X" the new exclusive Wii U title from Monolith Software is looking. So what i would like to know it why gaming websites have not had a single article on this latest footage?For instance as of writing this post, IGN, Polygon and CVG have not had a single post about the new trailer shown. Instead all of these sites and more have instead decided to focus on the recent news trickling out of E3 like the loss of exclusivity for Deus Ex: Human Revolution, or how underwhelming their E3 performance was. Or how Nintendo are working on a free to play game. But still 2 days later after the announcement and no articles around X? Why? there is no excuse for it.

I built a backlog of games when I was working last year. When my final year of uni came in the autumn I decided to focus more on graduating than playing games :( Anyway as a result I have a bit of a backlog on the games I need to play and i missed out on some gems which I want to get through this summer. I also picked up some deals whilst browsing online. Fun Fact, every game on the list was brought from Christmas 2011-present.Currently I'm playing through Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn (Wii), Super Mario All Stars (Wii) and Tales Of The Abyss (3DS), Kid Icarus (3DS) and Pikmin 2. I'm about half way through the 3DS games and coming close to finishing the Wii Games and I just need to find Louie in Pikmin 2.Slightly premature I know, but would be nice to know in advance of what to play next rather than waiting around when ive finished the above games. I made a short Google Questionnaire hoping to get people's opinions on what to play next. It's pretty simple the games with the highest votes in each of the four categories PlayStation, Wii, Ds and 3DS, will be the games that I play next, (I put Persona 4 in the Playstation category because I don't have any other PS2's games i haven't played). Saying that I just ordered Luigi's Mansion 2, Animal Crossing and Mario &amp; Luigi's Dream Team for a 3 for 2 offer for £40/$60 so thats increased my 3DS games abit! Although i may just play Animal Crossing on the side of whatever I play next as its a relaxing game to play.Please vote if you can using the link below!https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YSyhXqNJcyXhlsATfRMQuYPVABORnSsQ8Z1YBBw_91Q/viewformIf you have any suggestions for future games I could play please do let me know!Many ThanksTrilink32

1kfglq	-13616	1376586445	HomeworkHelp	Help Assessing Role Played By Dopamine In The Theory Of Addiction	Hey everyone im in the middle of a university summer assignment, im writing a paper on assessing the role played by dopamine in the theory of addiction. I understand that certain drugs like cocaine and amphetamines can increase dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, and that dopamine is necessary for addiction to occur. Im fine with that bit of the theory however there are apparently 3 arguments for dopamine's role in addiction, which are Hedonia, Reward learning and Incentive Salience. Hedonia has something to do with sugegsting that dopamine in the nucleus accumbens acts as a pleasure neurotransmitter, while learning apparently focuses on the prediction of future rewards. Incentive Salience is the major one that i cant quite grasp. But in general Im confused as to how all of these are linked with addiction, i've read around a little bit but im having alot of trouble understanding these hypothesis in their basic forms, especially with incentive salience. This makes it incredibly difficult to search for evidence for/against these hypothesis's when i dont quite understand the hypothesis themselves.Normally i would go to my university library to get some books on the matter, but i cant access my university library for the next couple of weeks due to some expansion and maintenance. Right now i just feel like an absolute idiot.I was hoping someone (s) could help clear these hypothesis up for me by explaining the core aspects of these theories to me in a more reader friendly manner, that would be much appreciated.Many ThanksTrilink32

This is my first time trying to repair a laptop because i had nothing to do in the holidays after breaking up for the semester of uni.Ill start with the laptops history, though if you just want to skip to the problem then just skip the first couple paragraphs.Firstly the laptop wouldnt charge the battery, and shortly after something happened (to this day i still dont know what because i wasnt around when it happened) to the power supply which ended up leaving black burn marks around the jack. So i brought a replacement power adapter and tried it out and still the laptop wouldnt charge at all or even power on at this point. We tried the charger out on a friends laptop (who had the same one as us) and it worked there so we knew it wasnt the charger.Anyway my dad suggested to take apart the laptop and look at the charging jack port on the motherboard because it seemed extremely loose to him. So i opened the laptop up very carefully looking and unplugging all the ribbon cables in the system. Anyway a couple hours later, i got through to the motherboard and the charger port jack which was soldered onto the motherboard. The jack itself was extremely loose like my dad suggested and was on the verge of snapping. So my dad said i should order a new charger port jack and then he'll solder it on (hes an electrician so it made sense).Anyway a week later after the part arrived and my dad soldered the part into place, i began to put the laptop back together again. Barring 1 screw (still dont know where it goes) i managed to put the entire laptop back together. Now i put in the new laptop charger and boot on the laptop. I think success, because all the power lights have come on, and the laptop screen is glowing and i can hear the sound of the laptiop starting up and any minute now ill be back to browsing the web on the laptop in no time. Sadly after booting the laptop up for the first time in weeks, the screen remains lit up but black with nothing coming up on screen. The laptop even seems to be going through the normal boot up phase with the screen going off for a brief second before entering what would be home desktop. I have no clue whats wrong ive tried some options by scouring the web using my desktop pc like unplugging the power cable/battery then holding the button for 10 secs before putting them both back in. I also tried removing and reinserting the ram for a period of time, but alas to no avail. Ive found out it might be a corrupt bios problem and so i proceeded to download the latest bios software from the Acer website (http://www.acer.co.uk/ac/en/GB/content/drivers). However im a little clueless about how i can install this on my laptop :S I have a formatted USB ready for use but im a little worn out after researching for the past 4hours or so on what to do, so im unsure how i can make my USB a bootable device for the bios. I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction? Am i doing the right things, is there anything else i can do? I ideally want to try everything i can before i take it to a local tech support which i really want to avoid because its expensive. Sorry for the long essay, but thought i would be as indepth as possible when trying to explain this problem, hopefully there is someone who can help me.Many Thanks in AdvanceTrilink32

Hey everyone, just ordered and recieved my new Triton headset, but for some reason my computer is not picking up the mic part of the headset? The sound is picked up fine like a normal pair of headphones i can listen to anything on the computer, but for some reason when i open an audio program to use the Mic, the Mic doesnt pick up the sound i produce at all. Below is my main system specs:Os - Windows 7 UltimateProcessor - AMD Athlon II x2 4400e @ 2.70GHzRam - 4gb of DDR2 RamSound Card - Creative Sound Blaster Audigy SEHeadset - TRITTON Kunai™ Stereo Gaming Headset for PC, Mac, and Mobile DevicesNot sure what the problem is. The Triton headset seems to be one of the later models as it only comes with 2 audio jacks (green  and pinky/purple line). Put the Green line to the Green Jack and the Purple Pink line to the Red Jack., but no sound comes out. Scouted on Youtube for a solution, but to no avail.

Hey everyone, just ordered and recieved my new Triton headset, but for some reason my computer is not picking up the mic part of the headset? The sound is picked up fine like a normal pair of headphones i can listen to anything on the computer, but for some reason when i open an audio program to use the Mic, the Mic doesnt pick up the sound i produce at all. Below is my main system specs:Os - Windows 7 Ultimate Processor - AMD Athlon II x2 4400e @ 2.70GHz Ram - 4gb of DDR2 Ram Sound Card - Creative Sound Blaster Audigy SE Headset - TRITTON Kunai™ Stereo Gaming Headset for PC, Mac, and Mobile DevicesNot sure what the problem is. The Triton headset seems to be one of the later models as it only comes with 2 audio jacks (green and pinky/purple line). Put the Green line to the Green Jack and the Purple Pink line to the Red Jack., but no sound comes out. Scouted on Youtube for a solution, but to no avail.

Hey everyone, just got my first android based phone (yes i will be checking out the android subreddit after i post this), the Motorola Moto GP because it was a steal at £99! Anyway, after a play around with it, im become really shocked at how certain well known apps i.e. the twitters, snapchats, whatsapps etc, require access to my message and microphone/camera which they can turn on at any time without my permission.This has made me quite disillusioned has practically turned me off using these apps at all, i dont like the idea i can be spied on at any given time. Why does these apps require access to my microphone and camera? Anyway i was wondering is there any app or something that i could do to stop these apps (before i try to install them again) trying to access my personal information? 
20f3mu	-13616	1394820235	statistics	Confused calculating Cohen's d!	Hey everyone im confused about calculating Cohen's d. So ive been reading around effect sizes because i need to learn how to calculate them if i want to get the higher marks in whatever assessment/exam comes my way this year at Uni.However im confused about how to calculate Cohen's d for equal samples sizes.After reading [Leech et al's 2011 book](http://www.amazon.com/IBM-SPSS-Intermediate-Statistics-Interpretation/dp/0415880475)Ive been told their are 2 ways to calculate effect sizes for differences, one way for equal sample sizes and another way for unequal sample sizes.The formula's presented in this book are the following: [Cohen's d Formula's](http://i.imgur.com/31WyEOe.jpg)Im fairly comfortable with the unequal sizes calculation as ive worked a couple of examples out for myself and its fairly straight forward. However when it comes to the equal sample sizes calculations im confused. Specifically the SD pooled part of the calculation, Leech et al suggests to average both the SD's of Group 1 &amp; 2 then divide by 2. Now after showing my lecturer some effect size calculations for feedback, he says this is the wrong way to calculate cohen's d for equal sample sizes and told me a different way which i have now conveniently forgotten, even worse hes on leave for a couple of weeks so i cant ask him about the calculations until he comes back.Anyway after looking online and a few videos, apparently this way is indeed wrong and is a common mistake to average the Sd's then divide by 2. So in short how to i calculate SD pooled properly in an experiment with equal samples sizes? Im just confusing myself into a corner and have no idea where to go next, would very much appreciate if someone could clear this up for me.

2cj8in	-13616	1407103227	HomeworkHelp	[Undergrad Chemistry] Practice Question - Need help understanding the solution.	Hey everyone im prepping for an entrance exam which requiress knowldge of undergraduate chemistry. So ive read alot of chemistry and decided to start answering some sample questions of the exam itself a couple of months before.This particular question concerns Steroisomers. I understand that Sterioisomers are basically 4 different covalently bonded atoms/groups of atoms to a Carbon atom and have different spatial arrangement such that a steroisomer and its mirror image cannot be superimposed onto each other.However in trying to work out this solution to 2 particular sample questions, i am confused as to how the answers are:40 - C41 - BCould someone explain to me how C is the non superimposable image, because when i drew all the figures out and put a mirro to them they all seemed non superimposable to me. Additionaly with the 2nd question, when i drew out the structures for 2-butanol and 2.2 dichlorobutane again it seeemd to me both strcutures were not steroisomers. Obviously im doing something wrong here and i was just wondering if someone could show me what that is. Many Thanks

This is far from a huge outlier, with very little talent around him his stats have been consistently awesome all year. Additionally, his athleticism and physical profile is top notch, along with no real positional concerns (Clear NBA SG/SF).DraftExpress moved him up to 20th in their mock draft recently, not bad for a guy largely off the radar pre-season. But looking at the guys ranked ahead of him, I prefer him to pretty much everyone from 10-20.This years Caldwell-Pope, with draft position adjusted for the improved talent available? He just fits what NBA teams look for after the top-tier talent has been exhausted, a player with a complementary skillset and high chance of NBA success. I see no major problems with comparing him to guys like Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Danny Green etc, defensively gifted players with limited, yet useful offensive games.http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/K.J.-McDaniels-41152/stats/http://www.draftexpress.com/nba-mock-draft/2014/
1ydoyj	-13618	1392846447	NBA_Draft	Exum's Draft Preparation	By draft night it will have been over 7 months since Exum last played competitively, and this was at the low-level Australian high school championships. His most recent high-level play was at the 2013 U19 FIBA champs, more than a year prior to the draft. It's reasonable to wonder how GMs will view this unusual preparation.I suspect it may be a positive as he is able to focus his energies purely on addressing his weaknesses (Strength and shooting). If anyone has been keeping up with the limited coverage of Exum, he looks stronger and his shot looks prettier (It remains to be seen how significant the improvements will be). I view Exum's year similarly to the redshirt years some athletes take in college. Here are a few recent examples of players taking non-injury redshirts and subsequently improving their stock significantly:| Player         | RSCI | Pre-RS PER | Post-RS PER | Drafted   | Age |----------------|------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----| Rodney Hood    | 26   | 15.5       | 21.7        | 2014?     | 21| Ben McLemore   | 39   | n/a        | 23.2        | 7 (2013)  | 20 | Kelly Olynyk   | n/a  | 19.8       | 37.0        | 13 (2013) | 21| Colton Iverson | 151  | 14.7       | 26.8        | 53 (2013) | 23There are some other examples that may be relevant too but are difficult to appraise, like Enes Kanter, Trevor Cooney, and Jahii Carson. Overall I think there is some evidence that focused training is superior for player development than competitive play.Disclaimer: I have limited college basketball knowledge, so there may be more examples of redshirts out there that I'm not aware of.

I am looking for a database, preferably in an easy to consume format, which will give me all the item Prefixes and Suffixes, their minimum item level, and stat range.I also need to find a clear formula for how they are combined, and which affixes may be on which types of gear.I'll then take this data, and combine it with the item database from d3db.com and generate the theoretical top damage/armor and afixes possible for all weapons, armor, and items.I'd expect this database to be in the many millions of combinations given the number of items * affixes. But it would be an interesting project for me.Any help would be appreciated.

I have been running a Bash / Rend build for a while that's pretty strong. But Act 3 is proving harder than I'd like. I feel like I should have more Damage, but not sure where to get it. I feel like I should take less damage, but don't know where to up my resistances other than my helm.I have ~5 mil for upgrades, where can I put that to get the best bang for the buck? IT seems I can't touch an All Res/ 80 Str / 100 Vit / 3 socket chest for less than 15 mil... and it feels like I'm stuck here.Any advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance.

11us3r	-13634	1350845648	Guildwars2	Crowd sourcing Bot management. An idea to use the GW2 community to curb botting.	So, inspired by the screenshot of the heard of bots trying to kill the rabbit... and with a little too much coffee... I began to ponder...What if we could drop something that to the human player, was obviously not a foe... but would stop bots in their tracks.I present: The Bot BunnyAn infinite use equippable weapon in the form of a bunny. It's only power."Drop a bunny on the ground that will look cute for all to see. Bunny will run away if no one's looking after 1 minute."When dropped, the bunny becomes target-able. And kill-able. But it's nameplate should emulate one of the many aggressive monsters within the zone it's placed in. Otherwise, the bots could simply "if target =  bunny keep going".Bot Bunny's health pool is sufficient that it will take a single player 30 seconds to bring it down. Allowing for it to exist long enough to provide a bottle neck for bots.When killed, the bunny immediately spawns another bunny at full health. Provides no loot, no coin, but simply provides another target. Bots will pick up this new target, and continue to kill the bunny.Server side, A-Net can keep track of how many times a single player has killed a Bot Bunny and use this for tracking purposes. Players wouldn't target this bunny... it's a bunny, Not a mob... they'll pass it by... But bots will not be able to distinguish the targetable killable bunny who's nameplate reads "Risen Archer" and every time they kill it, another spawns.... effectively locking the bot(s) in place.If nobody touches the bunny, the bunny will simply vanish.IMO this could be a simple way for us, the community, to point out bots, while taking non-damaging action when we see a bot to lock it down. With this, we could control the bot population on our own, while providing A-Net with data on bots in mass.I welcome your thoughts.

1cq3q0	-13634	1366432659	self	Reddit, can we discuss the fact that we have just stripped an American Citizen of his fundamental constitutional rights?	Think about this. This man is an American Citizen. (Yes, he immigrated, but so did most of us at one point.) He is no different than you, or me. Except he has committed a crime AND the government believes that even though he is in custody, he, and more importantly, the people he may know, continue to pose a threat.Does this give the government the right to use "Advanced Interrogation Techniques".And if you answer "Yes" to that, I ask this: If being an American Citizen does not give you FULL protection under the constitution, then what happens if the government moves the line that you must cross?What about Kidnappers? Those we feel know the whereabouts of a missing person? Drug dealers? This man knows other people. Other people know this man. Is simply associating with another American enough to give the government the right to strip you of yours?What this guy did was heinous. IMO He deserves the death penalty for this. And, if he's working with others, lets find them, and prosecute them too. But is it not possible to do this it in such a way which preserves the fundamental rights which our country was based upon.

My wife and I have been dieting for a while and after loosing about 30lbs each we are looking to include some workouts into our life. Our kids are starting a martial arts class which we both want to join, but after previewing one of their classes we fear we would be unable to participate due to the physical requirements.But this is a goal we would both like to strive towards. Enter Insanity workout.This workout appeals to us both due to it's lack of equipment and use of simple movements. However again, after attempting just a few positions and previewing some of the workouts, I'm sure a single workout would leave us unable to move... much less workout again.So, what I need is a simple routine online, mobile app, or even just list of workouts that we can do to prepare our ex-WoW Raiding, Programmer bodies for movement.(edit in case it matters. My Wife and I are 34, 260-240lb respectively)Thanks in advance!*TL:DR* Want to do Insanity workout, too out of shape for the warm up. What can we do to prepare our No-Shape bodies?
1ers7t	-13634	1369153546	askscience	Could an array of turbine engines move enough air to shoot down a tornado?	In the wake of the massive tornado in Moore, OK, I was explaining to my kids how tornados were formed when a thought occurred to me.If tornadoes are formed solely out of the movement of air, might it be possible to blow one up by disrupting the air flow? I imagine a bank of high output Jet engines aimed at the top of the funnel and pushing enough air to displace the rotation. Or at least disrupt it while over a city.But how big would that array of engines have to be? If we were to scale it up without limits, what would it take to knock one of these things out of the sky?

1m9c88	-13634	1379007535	martialarts	Dad v. Drunk Guy: How my kids got a demonstration in the application of martial arts in self-defense last weekend... and lessons I learned from the encounter.	Background: I have 3 years training in Tukong Moosul TKD, Aikido, some BJJ. But it's been 15 years since I stepped foot in a dojo.Last Sunday my wife, 2 8 year old daughters, myself and our dogs were all out for a jog around our neighborhood around 8PM. We were about half way through the jog and suddenly a dog darted out from a porch at the girls. The dog was barking, and crouched... he seemed protective of his territory but not aggressive per-se I jumped out between the dog and girls and just stood big and tall, giving him another target. Enter drunk guy. (about 6, 280 lb, very broad shouldered) "Oh he's not gonna bite. He's only out here because I'm out here." And he proceeded to reach for his dog. The girls and my wife had walked around me by now and were continuing down the sidewalk. The dog, noticing them again, changed direction and started after them again. I jumped in between them again and this time yelled "Get back!"Drunk guy snapped. He stood up and pushed me, his hand sliding up my chest and cracking me in the jaw. "Hey buddy! Don't yell at my fuckin' dog I'll kick your ass!". This caught me completely off guard. He went from helpful to physical in 0.3 seconds. Now, he's squared off against me and he's got his fists clenched... raised in a fighting stance... I was shocked, and felt clearly threatened. In a moment of distraction, he turned to yell at someone in the house. I had a very long instantaneous conversation with myself where I weighed the pros and cons of trying to talk the situation down or take action. I did not feel that I could defuse the situation, and I felt that friends and further attack was imminent so I decided to act. I was positioned in an open palmed fighting stance... I delivered a solid palm strike directly to his nose. For a moment, I was a bit taken aback by my own actions. I didn't immediately follow that punch up half hoping that he would back off and that would be that. But, when he had regained his footing he charged me with a strait midline grapple attack, catching my right leg on the outside of his left arm and pushing me back into a parked truck.At this point, I'm in an awkward position... leg up over his shoulder, defending against a wild swing... but I noticed I'd captured his right arm, so I thought, Fuck it... pull guard.I swung my left leg up and caught my right ankle and ended up in a standing triangle choke. Drunk Guy came to his knees and eventually landed hard on his right side which dislodged my leg lock, nullifying the choke. Still, I was maintaining control of his arm in an arm bar, I'm not firmly in control of my opponent. I don't have a choke, but I have control with my legs still... and he's not able to do anything damaging to me. So I just held him here. Now, he's screaming at me... I'm yelling at him to stop... my wife is yelling at me, kids are screaming at all of us, dogs are barking... it's created quite the ruckus... The next thing I know. His friend (Tim) and his wife appeared out of NOWHERE standing right next to my head. I thought... "I'm fucked... I fucked up..." His wife is drunk, screaming, and squared off to kick me in the head and I made it clear that "You need to back up or I will break his arm.". They both backed off.MUCH to my advantage,... Tim turned out to be sober...  and instead of just wailing on me asked "Whats going on here!" so... I told him... "I'll let go when he calms down!". Drunk Guy say's "I'm done! Let me go." and had stopped fighting and struggling... so I 'Negotiated an Exit' as my Sensi always put it... and told him what to do when I let go.I let go, rolled him off me, and rolled back and got to my feet.There was a period of tension as he stood up, screaming profanities, threatening to sue me, but he finally walked away and went inside.I shook Tim's hand. Thanked him for helping me defuse the situation. Thanked and apologized to the wife for interrupting their evening... and walked QUICKLY away. The whole altercation lasted maybe 3-5 minutes.So, that's the story... what were the lessons?* Don't let the fight go on too long. Sometimes you can't avoid this... but I could have. Mine was not a decisive victory, it was a battle of attrition. He gave up, but only after he wore out. If Tim had come out swinging... I'd have been in deep shit. * If you're hold isn't working... either focus on it and fix it or give it up and move to something else.* Don't stay on the ground when you don't control the environment.* If you decide to act... go all in. I didn't follow up that very first punch... if I had, he wouldn't have had time to gain footing and rush me. I would have been in better control.* Once you're in control of a situation, stop aggression. Don't turn a self defense situation into an assault situation when you have the upper hand.* Shit can go from fine... to WTF in a heartbeat. I didn't have nearly as much time to assess the situation as I'd liked. There was no peacock display of manhood and trash talk... it was jut BOOM! Now your in a fight.... hope you don't get your ass kicked.* Your brain goes to shit when the shit hits the fan. All that mental fanciness that you picture goes right out the window. You fall back on instinct, basics, and training.* Someone once said "Martial Arts is like boiling water. You stop training, and you'll cool off." I'm likely to head back to the Dojo soon to begin training again.* You never know when some random guy is going to blow the fuck up because you do something benign. Keep your guard up. I hope by sharing my experience I can simply provide insight into a real encounter to those who may be starting their training. Feel free to add to this, AMA, or simply provide your thoughts.**TL;DR:**Dad v. Drunk Guy on a family jog. Dad controls the situation with a sloppy Triangle Choke and an arm bar. Small mistakes could have lead to a bad outcome but all in all everything worked out better than expected. Is heading back to MMA Dojo to get his edge back.(edit: I a word)

And I don't miss the AH one bit.Well, maybe one bit... I can't help but think that there will be a pain point when it comes to crafting, patterns, and gems. I would love to have a place to source new materials for crafting, and source gems for upgrades. As well as a place to dump extra gems &amp; mats when crafting becomes less of a focus. Keep the AH for gems, crafting patterns, and crafting materials. Remove the gear from the AH.Thoughts?

I took my 9 year old twins to the Ortho and they said I needed to immediately start them on spacers to start expanding their pallet. If we didn't then we would risk impaction of the upper canine teeth.We've seen this coming and have prepared for this, but the immediacy of it caused us to look for a second opinion.The second opinion told us that we did NOT need to start them on spacers, and we should instead pull their 3 front baby teeth to make room for their adult teeth. That we would NOT have risk of impaction of the upper canine teeth, and that we could wait up to 2 years to start treatment. He was very anti-early expansion.I've now very confused.

1vygcy	-13634	1390499122	Guildwars2	[BUG]? Unable to fight after the first few minutes of the clockwork fight on my Condi Necro. Anyone else?	I don't know if this is specifically related to my Condi Necro or not. I only got to do the fight a few times last night. But every time I did the fight after about the first few minutes I found that I was unable to cast almost ANY power on my bars. I could click the button, but the power would not go off cool down and I would not cast. Even auto attacks would not cast.The 3 exceptions were DS, DS:3, and Plague. But even when plague casts, I could not toggle between the plague modes.This persisted even after we downed the boss (let me tell you how special I feel that it was our server-first kill, and I was unable to participate for the last 6 minutes of the fight :/). I had to port to another zone in order to be able to cast any marks, wells, or powers.I was not DCed. As I saw everything happening. Keyboard and Mouse worked as normal. Movement worked normally. Mouse clicks on bar did nothing.Theory: After casting so many conditions, and using Epidemic from the Champs to surrounding baddies, the server has somehow flagged me for cheating and is preventing me from casting.Has anyone had this same experience? I'll try to get it on twitch tonight.

I quit and re-joined at 1.0.3, 1.0.5, 1.0.8... and now I'm back again at 2.0.1... and honestly, I'm having fun with 2.0. I like the gear progression, it feels much better. I like the AH removal. I like the class changes (Wizard changes... OMG). But I have a problem.When, in 1.0.8, I reached the top of the gear progression... I could farm for gear to sell on the AH or RMAH. (Or god forbid upgrade an alt). But now, when I reach that top cap... what am I supposed to do? Eventually, I'll hit a point where all my gear allows me to run Torment VI, and I won't need gear... what incentive will there be then?I have 4 accounts.

1zn7dv	-13634	1394043376	Guildwars2	A proposal for a participation based reward structure for boss and event rewards.	In the last living story patch we've seen commanders and players AFKing for the full event and still getting full rewards. This patch is no different with several dozen people at times standing at the HOLO entrance, waiting on the masses to do their work for them.Thus, I propose a scalable solution which, I think, will encourage event participation and is not overbearing on the event participants. While my example is geared towards big champ / boss fights, it could easily be modified to work at the event scale where mobs are not the goal.* A "Hit Bar" would appear below the boss's heath bar in the target window.* The Hit Bar would fill as we hit the boss. It should be relatively easy to fill this bar, FAST for white mobs only taking 1-2 hits to fill, Longer for elites and Very Long for champs. * Auto attacks and Dots should count for 1/10th of a signature attack when filling the bar.* Once the bar is filled. If a hit isn't registered for 10 seconds it should degrade 5% per second.* If the player is dead, the degradation timer should be extended to 30 seconds.* Rewards should be tiered based on the amount of hitbar filled.* * 75-100% = Full Gold and Full loot reward* * 50-75% = Full gold and 75% roll modifier on loot tables* * 10-50% = Gold only reward* * 5 - 10% = 50% gold reward* * 0 - 5% = nothingPlayers would have to be actively engaged in fighting the boss for a significant amount of time in order to be eligible for rewards. AFKing auto attacks wouldn't fill it fast enough.Hit bars can be adjusted and tuned to prevent afkers from being afk for the whole fight, and only coming back for the last 15 seconds to fill the hit bar. Example: When fighting HOLO, you it should take 300 hits to fill the bar.People joining a fight late and only able to get a tap or two in (depending on the mob) would still get rewards of some kind.This would not have to be applied to all mobs, or even world mobs... it could only be champs and above. A similar event participation algorithm could be implemented for event rewards not tied to mobs (Citizen rescue).I think this algorithm could benefit the community, and I'd like to hear your thoughts.

28kh98	-13634	1403199610	wow	Returning to the game after an extended break. How do I build up my Mythic Raiding guild?	My wife and I are coming back to the game after an extended break. We raided ICC -&gt; Deathwing heroics and I lead the raids and ultimately, the guild we were in at the time.After Cata, the guild disbanded as life intervened for many key players and my wife and I took a break. We're back now and looking forward to WOD.I feel like I'm too late for this expansion... but I'd like to build up the guild for the mythic raiding that is to come.My question is, How do I build up this guild? I don't have a current raid team. Our mains are barely geared for Flex at this point. And the guild is low level.I don't feel like I have anything to offer a dedicated raider who's currently doing HM content. But I know if I don't get the ball rolling soon it might be too late.

2q4gyu	-13634	1419294711	self	Help me prank my children with a "Reindeer Game"	Ok, so some backstory.When my twins were 3 years old they had a nasty habit of coming out of their room at midnight. On Christmas Eve we were putting together bikes for them behind our locked bedroom door and I needed to know if they opened the door... so I tied a jingle bell to the door with some ribbon and draped it over the railing across the hall... expecting it to, well, jingle.Instead, when the door was opened, the bell popped over the railing and nailed my daughter in the head. I rushed out and in an effort to calm her told her that it must have been the Reindeer playing Reindeer Games... Thus a tradition was born.Every year the reindeer play tricks on them, leave them little notes, and candies.* They made it "Snow" by dropping fake snow on them.* They wrapped their door frame... (that was a bit traumatic)* They left them slippers with shaving cream in the toes (one of their favorites)* They rigged a present with party poppers.This year, they're 10. And I think they can handle pretty much anything. This is the last year this whole Santa Rouse is going to work... the last year I can truly blame the reindeer... and I'm out of ideas.What awesome, memorable, and yet not mentally damaging prank can I play on my kids this year.

Before that I'd taken a long break so I really only have a few months into the game. I'm a heavy WoW Raider, and I just don't have the time for WoW anymore. But with all the changes in GW2, it's a bit overwhelming. I log in, and I don't really know what to **do**.I have a necro, warrior, and guardian on Maguuma at 80 with somewhat descent gear on all 3. Back in vanilla, I loved the living story. I'd run around in WVW a bit with the commanders... that was fun. I found vanilla dungeons boring with the stack to win in COF meta. And I never could get a good group for fractals or Teq. Is WvW what it was? What do I need to know to get back into that?What is the state of dungeons? Have dungeons changed much? I would have to buy the living story parts... is it worth it?Help me get back into this glorious game.

In the event of a "DC", the game would not allow the same account to reconnect until the original instance has timed out.Thoughts?

I can never get first place no matter what I try there is always at least one person thats better than I am. this fucking complex started in highschool where I was the co captain of my improv team and I know what you think co as in 2 people with the same amount of power but no it was captain and co captain and the one that got captain got it without even fucking trying she was just blessed with the fucking skill and no matter how fucking hard I tried she was always fucking better than me and it really hurt. I tried out for a dance team and despite people telling me how good I did and that "I killed it" I still didnt make the team. Then I stayed with a club when and I did everything for that club supported all the fundraisers met all the members even the ones that just came to one or two meeting, I went to all the events and now even now after all the time I put in because I loved the club and I felt like the people in the club liked me it ended up that I lost to someone that came in later to the club for our membership position. It wasnt that people didnt like me it was just they liked him more. I couldnt even beat him because he was just naturally better at attracting people because of looks or whatever and now i dont think I should even fucking try to excel at anything anymore I feel like I should just continue through life being mediocre because I obviously cant be the best why even try for second. I just feel like a failure cuz when ever i set a goal or my sights on doing something someone always does way fucking better then me. Its not even worth trying to be good at something anymore

So i just started making cuffs for an event coming up but the string i have is too thick to use for 3Ds so What I'm doing is using the string to make the base and then for all the 3D stuff tying on fishing line and using that! It makes stringing through the bead multiple times pretty easy and pulling tight isn't too much of a problem because it isn't stretchy :D has anyone had any bad experience doing this? if not then I would definitely recommend trying it!

Not my first time building, but it is my first time submitting to /r/buildapc. It was super simple and super quick. For whatever reason I have more fun searching through benchmarks and trying to find the right cpu/gpu combo to give me the best bang for the buck, rather than just building a monster of a machine.Notes:- PSU isn't great, but it had decent reviews and is more than enough wattage for what I need. I was trying to spend as little as possible. - Not sure about what GPU yet. I was thinking a 2GB 7850 or a 660. Suggestions/Comments? Thanks!

I know a lot of people have this case and may be interested in removing the drive bay. It was super easy, all I did was take a flat head screw driver and hammer out the rivet heads; unconventional, but effective.**EDIT:** I couldn't help myself. I went to Microcenter and bought 4 fans to put in the case, two as front intakes, and two as top exhausts. I hubbed them all together and am using the last of the three SATA power connectors on my peripheral wire to power them with a Fans--&gt;Molex--&gt;Sata adapter. * I built my own grommets using crafting adhesive foam from Michaels. It was $0.88/sheet. It worked great for a cheap solution. * My 7870 came early, so I threw that in. * This weekend I will be building a mounting system for hard drives in the leftover space in the 5.25" bay.
1a8ccb	-13656	1363200536	excel	Return Row/Column Position of Unique Value in 2D Array	Is it possible to return me the row#/column# of a unique value within a 2D array? I know it can easily be done in a single row or single column , but the value (date) position I’m trying to dynamically locate could be anywhere in the array A:G.As an example:I have a calendar that someone else has built out in excel. There is no fancy format, it’s just an array of cells bordered and labeled to look like a calendar. Each space for a day of the month is 6 cells high. Each row within a day’s range contains the same type of data from one to the next (e.g. NAME is always in the first row of a day’s range).What I want to do is extract the data from the calendar by looking up the day’s date  with an INDEX, and using OFFSET to pull different pieces of data from each day. The only thing I don’t know how to do is pull the row and column locations for a value that could be anywhere in a 2D array.Any tips?Thanks!

The extra space was more of a luxury while building than a burden. The case has a ton of great peripheral features that you probably would find on more expensive models. E.g. modular drive bays, fan hub, intake filters, windowed, PSU standoffs, plethora of fan mounts. The only thing I wish that would have been included are grommets for the cable routing holes. They are dirt cheap and would have made the case feel more premium. It seems to be much more performance oriented and versatile than my R4 was. That said, it is less sturdy and seems to be of a slightly lower build quality in general, but this is to be expected given that it's part of the Source line and a full tower for around $90 retail. I would highly recommend the case to new builders looking for a full featured, full tower case. The plethora of features and versatility make it extremely easy to build in. Let me know if you guys have any other questions. Also, check out my [battlestation](http://imgur.com/a/09Fqn#0) I just built!Thanks for looking!

I saw the notification from PayPal for the payment received and left to have the card packaged and shipped at UPS. Unfortunately I didn't see that he had pushed the fees onto my side until after already shipping the unit.I immediately sent him a text and asked him to PayPal me the additional $8.28 in fees. He ignored several texts over the next few days, I kindly reminded every time I would text him updates, such as the tracking number or shipping status. He finally said after the card was delivered and tested, "Yeah, I'll do it later".This is the last communication I have received. I'm not going to make a deal about $8, but the fact that the guy completely ignores requests and doesn't do the right thing should be noted somewhere. I took the time out of my Saturday to ship within an hour of receiving the original payment. I paid $34.78 to have everything packaged as fragile, insured for $300, and shipped with express service. This kid couldn't even follow through with paying the full amount and then ignored all communication asking to make up $8.28!It speaks the this user's level of immaturity. I would not deal with him again.

2vka79	-13656	1423680491	buildapc	Newegg GTX 970 Response	I just wanted to make a quick post saying that I finally received a response from Newegg about my G1 Gaming GTX 970. I inquired about returning the card two weeks ago when the news broke out about the VRAM issue. Yesterday I received an email from them with a [pasted nvidia response.](http://imgur.com/CVeYOIC) I found this to be unsatisfactory in that I believe their test case shows a situation in which 4GB is going to be reached, so a similar bottleneck would be experienced on both cards. A better test would show something like 3.7GB of VRAM utilization, where the 980 still has full memory performance but the 970 has fallen off. Someone feel free to correct me if I am wrong here.Anyways, I just received a call today from a Newegg rep, Rosa. She offered me two choices. 1. A full refund in the form of store credit, return card.1. 30% of initial purchase price credited back to my card and I keep it. I chose the 30%. The card was $360, so I should be receiving over $100 back. I feel like for that money the card is a great value and the issue can be overlooked. That said, I plan to sell it once the new AMD 3XX cards come out. I do feel bad for Newegg in this case. It wasn't their screw up and now they are having to pay for it. I hope nVidia is compensating them for each instance of this. I know Newegg has taken a lot of flak recently for customer service related issues, but in this case I think they handled it right and I wanted to let that be known.It's also worth noting that Gigabyte basically told me to blow them when I asked about the issue. So not everyone is responding in kind across the industry.Feel free to discuss/ask questions,Cheers!EDIT: I just received the invoice for the money credited to my card. Here is a [screen of the email.](http://imgur.com/Ugz47ls)

BTS is located in Los Angeles and I was thinking they could host an event for TI3. Why would they do this? The short answer is, money. I would be willing to pay BTS to attend such an invent. If they reserve a venue for viewing (even if beer isn't included), I will be there. In addition, they have the resources to spread the word and make this a successful event. It might just be wishful thinking, but I am sure we can turn this into a popular fundraising event for BTS. Plus, dota fans get the coverage they deserve. What do you think?

On a good day, I can be popping and catching my kick flips stationary pretty damn well, but as soon as I try one moving it looks like i've never landed one in my life, I just can't seem to apply the stationary kick flip motion to when I'm rolling on the board. Any comments would be appreciated. (The main problem when I'm moving is that the board either rotates out of line with my body (like I'm doing a 45 degree backside flip) or my board doesn't stay underneath me (it goes out towards the direction I'm going or stays behind where I was rolling from))

I'm using a program called Tabit to write up these drum tracks for my band and that all works very well, but when it comes to turning the midi drum track into a loud enough click track to hear I struggle. I have access to programs like Audacity and Logic pro but nothing on google is helping. Any tips?

Being quite new to lucid dreaming, i've taken all the advice i've seen on this subreddit with a grain of salt and haven't exactly tried extremely hard to force myself to have a lucid dream. But recently i've started having 'experiences' where i'll have a nap, and then after coming to full rest it seems that my body will go numb, while i'm still mentally aware and awake, and at this point I panic a little, and try to wake up. Is this paralysis? How can I turn these things into lucid dreams? Is there a way?

2pzx00	-13673	1419192008	DestinyTheGame	Customizable Weapons and Armor	Iv been thinking lately about how much it can be a bummer to get drops that are so close to perfect but just 1 or 2 perks off. I really wish there was a way to pump Motes of Light into weapons and armors to change perks.For instance, did you get a new Auto Rifle but aren't happy with any of the options for sights/scopes available on it? Pay 10 Motes of Light and be able to swap out one of the available options for one more to your taste.Did you finally get the last drop needed to get you to 32, but it has perks for pulse rifles when your a hand cannon man? Pump some light into it and swap out that pulse rifle perk for a hand cannon one.I wouldn't want to be able to change too much lest every gun become identical but it would be nice. Maybe only be able change the perks in the columns not the "unique" perks like Firefly and Glass half fullMaybe be able to change your stats around, let you pay motes in to change armor around from Strength, Intellegince and Discipline.It just gives you something extra to be done with your extra Motes of light lets you tweak your set up for yourself and or different situations. Also means you don't have to have the feel bad moment of finally maxing out a raid piece and then a better one drops for you.TLW: let us use motes of light to tweak weapons and armor to our specific play style.

2rhrdd	-13673	1420528506	DestinyTheGame	Fix your favorite subclass	This is a thread for people to either suggest "fixed" versions of their favorite subclasses or to pitch what the potential 3rd subclasses will be.Personally as much as I like the Defender subclass, I think the super is really lacking, I understand it's a defensive subclass but I think not being able to shoot out of the bubble is a big mistake. I would have liked to see the bubble give a damage boost to any shots you and your fireteam members make from inside the bubble. Basically the defender throws down his bubble and says here is where we make our stand, the fireteam would pile in and just lay down a wall of fire on everything in reach. In PvP kills your teammates made from inside your bubble would count for an assist as well as a super kill allowing pure defenders to complete super based bounties. One of the perks in the skill tree would have been the blind perk as found on the helm of saint-14As for a 3rd Titan Subclass Id love to see the solar titan be similar to the blade dancer's super where your gun would go away during super, your fists would be lit with solar energy and you would run around punching people using the left and right triggers to control your respective fists. During this time you would have damage resistance and run faster (not as fast as blade dancers but still faster than normal)

I haven't talked to or even seen this person in 8-ish years. I moved half way across the country 5.5 years ago and have been in a committed relationship for a little over a year now. All of a sudden about 4-5 nights in a row, this girl pops up in my dreams, nothing sexual though. When I wake up I end up thinking about it throughout most of the day. Any idea what this could mean? Any advice?

32qw83	-13677	1429142719	heat	Thank you Heat from Seattle	Hello everyone let me first start by giving a little introduction. I live in Seattle, have been a Supersonics fan since birth and basketball has always been my first favorite sport. Well after the team was relocated to OKC, I was devastated and I stopped caring about basketball and actually kinda hated it overall. A few years later, my former beloved team was in the NBA finals against the Heat and I rooted my ass off for the Heat and couldn't have been happier to see Lebron get his 1st ring. The the next season, you guys added 2 of my favorite former Sonics players, Ray Allen and Rashard Lewis and it became easy to continue to root for the Heat. So I started to watch most regular season games and was ecstatic to see my former Sonics earn rings (even though it was Ray's 2nd one). I guess Miami is where former Sonics win championships starting with Gary Payton haha. I continued to watch the Heat the next season. This season felt different with the departure of Lebron and having most of the players gone including my former sonics. However, I kept watching them play and have grown attached to some of the newer players like Goran Dragic and Whiteside.Anyways, I want to thank the Heat for filling a void. I will always have a soft spot for the Heat and will continue to root for them even (and hopefully) when we get a new team. Heat fans, cherish your team no matter how shitty they play or how badly the piss you off. Thank you Heat for bring back my passion for basketball! Heres to next season and a speedy recovery for Bosh.

2hvkw0	-13682	1412071769	soccer	Why i believe that Maradona was better than Messi	Maradona is hands down the best player I've seen period. As good as Messi is, he has always been surrounded by incredible talent in every Barcelona side. He's had the best ever midfield feeding him everything for a decade now. Maradona played in good to mediocre sides all of his career.Maradona joined Napoli when they had just finish 17th in the Serie A. 2 seasons later Napoli won the Scudetto. Bear in mind this was during possibly the most talented period in a European league ever, the 1980's Serie A. The 1980's Serie A had some of the best defenses in Football history and was the best, most competitive league in Europe by far at the time. We also must remember how much more you could get away with tackling wise back then. Maradona wasn't protected at all by refs like dribblers are nowadays and had to play through disgusting tackles that usually went unpunished. I believe Messi has benefitted from tackles from behind being banned. He has more space and time than Maradona was ever afforded, and Maradona was a class above when it came to mazy dribbles and creating space, even when he had people trying to kick lumps out of him with no repercussions. He lifted his teams beyond expectations, the most obvious case is the Argentina team in the WC in 86. He took a so-so, bordering on decent team and made them champions. Maradona is considered the only player along with Garrincha to win a World Cup by himself.Basically, Maradona took an average Napoli team to the Scudetto twice, in the world's toughest league of all time against some of the best defences of all time, won a World Cup on his own and again took Argentina to the final 4 years later with an infected Toe and while out of form.Messi has always had the greatest supporting cast in history built AROUND him, has never performed even close to Maradona's level at a World Cup and has never been tested league-wise outside his La Liga and has pretty much stat-padded against La Liga defences just like Ronaldo. La Liga defences are painfully mediocre.Maradona has won everything with average teams behind him, Messi has won everything with the best team of all time behind him.Messi is still top 5 of all time, but Maradona is the GOAT IMO. I hope there's people out there that still agree with this viewpoint.If you haven't seen much Maradona watch these: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ipl1mInKbYhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBAqGhqZq_M

2luobh	-13682	1415620008	soccer	Is Messi's peak over and will he ever hit the heights he did from 2010-2012?	Messi was phenomenal with the best midfield in the world feeding him  while having a system catered around him, and he shone in it. Since Barca have gone downhill circa 2013 it's been 2 years almost and Messi is still 'out of form.'Messi has been ineffectual in the big games he's played in this year. The Copa Del Rey final, World Cup Quarters to the final, Barca's final league game where they needed to beat Atletico for the title, the recent el Clasico and Champions League Quarters vs Atletico.Is his peak over and will he ever hit the heights he did before that won him 4 Ballon d'ors?

I've loved Pink Floyd a long time, but the lyrics of 'Time' never really impacted me, until i listened to it at 4am on my 20th birthday, life has gone so fucking fast the last 2-3 years, it feels like i was 17 a year ago.I have had anxiety issues from since i was a child, and my mates invited me to come to Canada with them, i wanted to but i thought i had no fucking chance. I'd never been overseas, what if i have anxiety issues up there? I can't just go home and run away from it. I need my mother to calm me down as childish as it sounds.Anyway, I re-read these lyrics over and over again:'Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain. You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today. And then one day you find ten years have got behind you. No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun. So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking Racing around to come up behind you again. The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older, Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.'I listened to Time about 20 times in a row, and it made me realise i'm being a fucking idiot and i should of course go overseas with my mates.Now i'm posting to you guys having just landed back in Italy from a 3 week trip to Canada!So thank you Pink Floyd for such a great fucking experience.

22osji	-13687	1397133648	TrueDetective	[SPOILER] Errol's position in relation to Tuttle/the Cult	Hello. I'm new. I actually joined Reddit for the sole purpose of asking this question, after spending the last few days reading all the discussions here.What is Errol's position in relation to the Tuttles/"Rich men worshipping the devil" that are shown in the video and are obviously into little children?I know that Errol's father/grandfather were involved, and how they are all related. But what is the dynamic between them? I find it unlikely that Errol is their leader. Is he just a rogue agent, possibly a child victim of the cult, who has gone on to do these killings, in a way that's brings attention to the ancient cult itself?And on a similar note, how does LeDoux fit in with this? We know that Errol was there when LeDoux was drugging the kids. But did LeDoux just work with Errol (possibly another cult victim?) or was he working with the Tuttles/Rich men too?It's never really specified, what the dynamic is between these three groups. What does everyone else think?

27v0na	-13687	1402474003	audioengineering	LCR mixing and Mono-compatibility	I love the idea of LCR mixing. It makes more sense to me, especially with rock music (in the broad sense of the word - ie drums, bass, guitar, synths, vocals). But I always struggle with hard panned stuff sounding decent in Mono.Take for example a pretty straightforward song with mono drums, bass, and vocals, with hard-panned overdriven guitars coming in for the chorus. I would try to make the guitar parts as different as possible - different guitars or pickups, amps, mics, even different parts using capos etc. I would also use a stereo plugin to narrow anything below, say 200, to mono.But I still find that the chorus won't sound good in mono.The same happens even with different instruments (say, synth on the left, guitar on the right or whatever).Are there any other tricks for improving this? It's not my monitoring, as I have checked reference tracks and they sound a lot better.I know it will improve if I narrow my wide panned instruments slightly. But that kindof goes against the point of LCR!
2b781q	-13687	1405849328	audioengineering	Suggestions: Rock songs without bass for mix references.	I'm about to mix an album which has a few songs without bass. Some of them have a guitar with an octave pedal which covers some of that low end. Some of them are just straight up guitars/drums.I'm looking for songs to use as mix references. Any suggestions?I'm aware of the Prince songs without bass (When Doves Cry, Kiss etc) but these are a bit too pop. It's more distorted guitars, almost in the vein of stuff like Mclusky, quite abrasive and jarring sounds. The drums are tracked pretty dry, I'm not looking for something with a huge, roomy drum sound (so White Stripes are out), something tighter, crisper.I'm not going for a big budget, clean sounding record. It's a pretty weird band (along the lines of Ween/The Frogs, but heavier) so it doesn't suit pristine production. I'm just looking for some reference stuff to listen to whilst mixing.Any ideas?

I have no doubt in my mind about this.Please continue to add to this informative database.

2mbsw3	-13687	1416004602	daddit	New dad struggling with parter's children	8 days ago my first child was born. She is awesome.My partner has 2 children to her previous marriage. They are both great kids, and I really get on with them well. One of them is 9 (we'll call her "B") and one of them is 3 (We'll call her "T"). Whenever I'm there, I spend time with them both, and they really seem to like me. I make sure I do stuff individually with them as well as alone. T has told me that she loves me on numerious occasions in that cute way that 3 year olds do, and until my baby was born, all was well.But since the new baby came along I've really struggled with T. Now B has been EXTREMELY helpful, she's pretty much acted like an adult most of the time, and I really don't think we could have coped without her!But T is causing me a lot of stress. I'm terrified of her accidentally harming my baby somehow. Now she's by no means a bad kid, not at all. But she's clambering on things, leaving toys and food everywhere, touching my daughter without washing her hands etc etc. It's really stressing me out. This is my first child, so I don't have the experience my partner has. Changing nappies, feeding her, helping her get to sleep...it's all new. And requires my concentration. It would be hard enough without T to contend with. But I'm constantly on alert with her around, and it's driving me nuts. I've ended up being quite short and impatient with her on a number of occasions. My partner has noticed it and it worries her. And it worries me.There's no doubt she'll pick up on how I am with her. And I admit, I'm being quite unfair, given that she's only 3 years old! But I can't help it, I am just so totally overwhelmed with anxiety about my baby's wellbeing that it's really hard to be as pleasant as I normally am with her. I've gotten to a point where, although I hate to admit it, I am beginning to resent a lovely little 3 year old! Me, a grown-ass man!I guess I just feel totally pathetic (not to mention slightly evil) for having these feelings towards an innocent 3 year old, but at the same time it's just coming as instict, to protect my tiny first child from a potential danger.Does anyone have any experience in this? Any tips they could offer? I feel like I'm losing my mind. I do have problems with anxiety (I take medication for this) and lack of sleep does make it worse.

I got a box of 5, as usual, but the first 2 I've tried from the box have been bad coils. Burnt taste as soon as I fire it up.As it's been longer than 7 days since I bought them I can't take them back for a refund. My question is, is it likely that the other 3 coils are bad as well? I don't want to try them out and waste any more liquid. Is there any way of telling whether or not they are bad coils without firing them up? If 2 from a pack of 5 are bad, is it very likely that they will all be?EDIT: The very helpful staff at The Vapour Room in Preston have offered to replace the pack for me. So if you're ever in Preston and in need of anything, be sure to pay them a visit. It's just across the road from the train station, in the town centre.

I'm not able to spend time or bond with my 7 month daughter, because her mother says that she cannot be apart from her, due to Attachment Parenting. Her mother broke up with me soon after she was born, for reasons that arent entirely clear to me (but are possibly suspicious). Since then I have minimal contact with my daughter.We have tried mediation, but the mediator said that it wouldn't work because my ex had "too much of an agenda". I have taken legal advice and am taking her to court, in 3 days.I have been told constantly by various professionals that my case is strong. That in the UK a father is entitled to "Reasonable Contact" unless he is a sex offender, violent, or a drug addict. I am none of these things. In the time I spent with my daughter I bathed her, changed her, played with her, and soothed her.But now that she is 7 months old, she is so utterly dependant on her mother that she can't be apart from her. She becomes massively distressed as soon as her mum leaves her line of sight. She is with her mother 24/7, sleeps with her, and is breastfed every time she is upset.So my question is, does it look like I have a chance in hell of actually getting quality time with my daughter? Although I am supposedly legally entitled to it (in the UK), does the whole Attachment Parenting thing override this?Does anyone have any experience in being denied time and the chance to bond with their child due to this parenting method? And any experience of how it is viewed in a UK court?
3b66j7	-13687	1435306021	microbrute	Sequencer "Rest" button problems...	Does anyone else have trouble with the Rest button on the sequencer? I got the 'Brute yesterday, read the manual, watched videos, and played for about 5 hours, but can't get the Rest to work.I'm synching to Volca Beats using MIDI out (I got the Beats modded) and it all synchs up nicely. But for some reason when I play a sequence, it just ignores the Rest button.I've tried Googling it but "Rest" is such a common word I'm not having any luck. Am I missing something really obvious here? Or is my unit defective?
3flsq3	-13687	1438597812	volcas	Sample length in Volca Sample	I'm in the market for a cheap sampler for live use. I need something with a built in sequencer that will synch with MIDI. I'm already using the Beats and Keys, along with a Microbrute and various other bits and pieces. The Volca Sample seems to be exactly what I need.However there's something I'm not so sure about. The samples I'd be looking to trigger would be longer than single drum hits. They would be sustained chords, or atmospheric/texture loops maybe between 5-10 seconds, possibly longer.All of the demos I've seen of the Volca Sample have been using really short samples. Drums, or brass stabs or whatever.I'd be looking to sequence stuff that was longer and slower. So maybe a sequence built of 3 different sampled chords. Or a short melodic phrase.Is this possible in the Volca sample? Or is it limited due to it's internal memory size?Also, can you set the time to 1/2 time or 1/4 time as you can on the Volca keys? So say if my Beats is playing in 90bpm, I can have the Sample playing back at half that rate?Any suggestions other than the Volca would be appreciated (if the Volca is no good for this). My budget is around £150 unfortunately, so no Elektrons for me.
3htoev	-13687	1440143652	synthesizers	Powering USB-powered devices...without a computer.	Is it possible to do this? I have a Waldorf Streichfett and an Akai MPX8, both of which are powered via USB. For my live setup, I won't be using a computer at all. I was wondering if I could use a USB hub, or something similar, to power these from a single plug, without using a computer?I do have adaptors to power both of these through a regular mains plug. But I'm trying to cut down on the amount of plugs I use when playing live, as I am already using 8! I may also be adding other USB powered bits of gear to the setup (Beatstep, small MIDI keyboard), which would potentially mean 4 plugs. I would like to find something (if possible) that could power all my USB devices from a single plug.Is this possible? Does this work? Or will I have to lug a laptop out with me onstage to use just as a power supply?

Especially now that a pretty similar God, Ao Kuang, received a pretty significant buff and when is the last time we saw  Ne Zha in competitive?Her main problem is that after a sash/ult she is a sitting duck, my personal suggestions:1) After she lands down from her ult or having killed someone with her ult, she gain 30% movement speed and a cripple / slow immunity.2) And or her ring bounce now gives her stacks on her passive and or her passive scales with her level.4) And or after killing an enemy with her ultimate she gains full stacks on her passive, if she already has full stacks she now has the ability to get 50 more stacks on her, this can stack up to 3 times.Maybe something like that, hopefully. =)
33xkys	-13697	1430066367	Psychonaut	A comment from a Buddhist Lama on the use of psychedelics	This might be somewhat controversial but by no means is my intention to be judgmental, I just like to share this quote that formulate my thoughts on psychedelics quite well:&gt; Psychoactive substances provide a glimpse of enlightenment that is just as "real" as any other experience which provides one with a glimpse of nirvana or enlightenment.&gt; He emphasized, however, that these substances should only be used by practitioners who have found ways to reach these semi-enlightened states regularly, without the use of substances. He stated that if one uses these substances as a sole means of attaining spiritual insight, that one will end up using them as a crutch or a "short-cut", either consciously or subconsciously. &gt;Once one has attained enough spiritual knowledge to be grounded in their practice, he believes that these substances can then be great tools for self-exploration. It's kind of like the idea that one needs to establish the breath as home-base before delving into more "complex" meditation techniques which encourage the entertainment of thought forms.&gt; The principle of ahimsa (non-violence) also applies to harming yourself. He stated that he believes that one should only use these types of tools if one can be relatively certain that they are not harming their own spiritual well-being by doing so, which requires a stable psyche and spiritual state of being.Now I can see the value in the transformation they can give us initially as an introduction to any spiritual state, especially when we are completely unfamiliar with them, but  I think it's more valuable and safe to then practice this in sober meditative way before jumping into the pool again so to speak. Because the last part I find to be quite on point and often dismissed by people, which is where it can go wrong, So I personally also think that one must first have a good basis of a spiritual life (practicing and learning about meditation/mindfulness/spirituality and also practicing a loving compassionate life) or else the force that these substances have can create too much of a storm in our often very stressed and self absorbed minds.-^Credits ^to ^/u/ThisByzantineConduit ^for ^original ^comment ^from ^the ^lama ^which ^can ^be ^found ^here ^https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/2xf03y/with_regard_to_biofeedback_technologyaided/

Well, what if it is just shown to us to just to remind us that there is something more out there and that these realizations make an effective imprint for that.

One paycheck away from the poorhouse! And now I’ve just lost my job, and it looks like the cash flow has stopped again. I’m getting really tired of the struggle. I’m 49 years old, and I’d like to have some security in life so that I could devote more time to “God stuff,” to soul “evoluting,” etc. That’s where my heart is, but it’s not where my life allows me to go…    Well, you’ve said a mouthful there, and I suspect you’re speaking for a whole lot of people when you share that experience. I’m going to respond to your truth one sentence at a time, so that we can easily track, and dissect, the answer. You have not been “at this spiritual game” for 20 years, you have been barely skirting the edges of it (This is not a “spanking,” by the way, this is just a statement of the truth.) I’ll concede that for two decades you’ve been looking at it; flirting with it; experimenting now and then… but I haven’t felt your true—your truest—commitment to the game until just recently. Let’s be clear that “being at the spiritual game” means dedicating your whole mind, your whole body, your whole soul to the process of creating Self in the image and likeness of God. This is the process of Self realization about which Eastern mystics have written. It is the process of salvation to which much Western theology has devoted itself. This is a day-to-day, hour-to-hour, moment-to-moment act of supreme consciousness. It is a choosing and a re-choosing every instant. It is ongoing creation. Conscious creation. Creation with a purpose. It is using the tools of creation we have discussed, and using them with awareness and sublime intention. That is “playing this spiritual game.” Now, how long have you been at this? &gt; I haven’t even begun.Don’t go from one extreme to the other, and don’t be so hard on yourself. You have been dedicated to this process—and you’re actually engaged in it more than you’ll give yourself credit for. But you haven’t been doing so for 20 years—or anything close to that. Yet the truth is, how long you have been engaged in it is not important. Are you engaged in it now?

It will deal with a more spiritual approach to life, which for me was exactly what I needed, since 'chasing the joys of the world' didn't bring me far, it actually made me quite depressed for a time, as it never was as fulfilling as I hoped. So then in hindsight, it was part of a valid path, it has brought me where I needed to be and it also doesn't mean that 'acting on your excitement' is bad advice. Though in my opinion, not the most whole advice.So for me, this path has been by far the most synchronous and rewarding one, which consists of: dedicating your time on focusing and going within, on being, on God and simultaneously becoming the most best and unconditionally loving version of yourself.Read it for free here: http://www.universe-people.com/english/svetelna_knihovna/htm/en/en_kniha_conversations_with_god_1.htmBest of luck everyone. 
39i3ax	-13697	1434058354	Psychonaut	A thought I had about the 'ripple effect' or the 'butterfly effect'	When you do something nice for someone, in what ever way that may be, a smile, a gift, a helping hand etc. it affects them, you and them might be uplifted by the act and the person you touched may in turn do something nice, or could now have the confidence to follow their dreams or actively forgive a person that has wronged them in the past etc.Your initial actions may cause a ripple effect, a ripple in to of life; even things like nature might be effected, it may even affect countless of generations to come after you (and or perhaps it may even ripple out through our souls non-physically eternally).In the same way it could be said that negative actions do the same, though I believe this is much weaker, as negativity can temporarily shut down and separate, where as positivism heals, integrates, connects and so creates more strongly.I find this thought greatly inspiring and very powerful, I hope you liked it and that this may be of use to you, have a nice life.

3dn3ef	-13697	1437151491	Dirtybomb	I moved my fov slider, it changed my resolution to the wrong setting and now I can't change it back	It sounds weird but it was weird, I readjusted the fov setting to what it used to be (which isn't even suppose to mess with your resolution right?) but I could still now only chose between 2 resolutions both of which are not the right ones for my screen.Could anyone guide me through the folders maybe so I can adjust it manually?

So you shall purge the evil from your midst." Deuteronomy 22:23-24Or that rape victims should marry their rapist?"If a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father.  Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her." Deuteronomy 22:28-29

Not to compete with this place in any way, I love the sub but I thought a forum would be fitting as well, the site is called www.bashar-forum.orgIt has a personal testimony of why I know Bashar is real, I will also have a private session with Bashar in a few months and you can submit questions there as well that may be asked. It's brand new so there aren't a lot of people yet, I am making similar posts on Bashar related places and in the youtube comments of some of the videos so could it grow. And thank you mat3j for letting me post this here.

3h0up3	-13697	1439586078	MrRobot	Found this comment on who Mr. Robot could be pretty interesting	&gt; Mr. Robot is Elliot's and Darleen's Dad, who faked his own death (During the ride to Steel Mountain, Elliot says sth about Robot being clinically insane and "When your friends jump off a bridge, would you? He would, without hesitation. Just to prove something". Formerly a EvilCorp employee, he decided to go into hiding (sth. with leukemia, Angela's mom etc. That remains to be figured out) - in order to plan and bring on the corporations downfall in the form of a long con.&gt; Mr. Robot is somehow aware of Elliot's amnesia and re-introduced him to FSociety during the first few episodes (Robot kind of ignores some crucial questios, like "Who are you?").&gt; I highly doubt, that he is a figment of Elliot's mental illness.

3h3hi4	-13697	1439647726	Psychonaut	For all Bashar fans! (forum, testimony and upcoming private session)	I am happy to see that the idea of Bashar is generally quite accepted here though I can surely understand why someone wouldn't be (directly) convinced, personally I am fully convinced of the validity of the entity because of my experiences though I still even have things that I don't understand or agree with. So for those who are unfamiliar with Bashar/Darryl Anka: Darryl Anka says he can channel an ET, to let this entity speak through him (youtube example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Gjc9hhhtro)So, why would anyone belief this crazy stuff?Well, what first grabbed my attention is that this person during his talk never had any second of hesitation when receiving questions from anyone, even doctors or scientist. He didn't gave vague answers, he actually gave direct (non 'spiritual') information which has caused many scientists and doctors to walk away very satisfied.  Never have I heard a 'I don't know' or 'Umm, well.. &lt;insert vague evasive answer here&gt;'.Never the less, the information was still so far out I couldn't really  belief or know it to be true, until I had a very synchronistic dream, which in short basically showed me very specific information regarding ET beings that was presented a week later after my dream in one of his talks (full post here http://bashar-forum.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=7)So I created a forum for all the people who share the wonder and excitement about this, or for anyone who is not yet convinced but perhaps are intrigued by the whole thing.It's called www.bashar-forum.org, it also has a thread where we gather and discuss questions that we will ask in an upcoming private session.If anyone feels like asking some questions, feel free. :)Edit: also, someone created a relevant sub /r/essasani

[...] It looked like a saucer, a disk. About the same time, I realized that it was suddenly going away from me - and there I was, running at about 300 miles per hour. I tracked it for a little way, and then all of a sudden the damn thing just took off. It pulled about a 45 degree climbing turn and accelerated and just flat disappeared."— Captain Donald Slayton, Mercury Astronaut"Look, I have a pension to worry about. I have a family to take care of, and they told me to just back away from this entirely or else."— Astronaut James Irwin, Apollo 15"Look, I have a pension to worry about. I have a family to take care of, and they told me to just back away from this entirely or else."— Astronaut James Irwin, Apollo 15**A fewPresidents:**"I can assure you that flying saucers, given that they exist, are not constructed by any power on earth."— President Harry S. Truman"The phenomenon of UFOs is real. I know that there are scientific organisations which study the problem. It must be treated seriously."— Soviet President Mikhail GorbachevFor more, and for the sources of these quotes see: www.spaceflare.net

3is1du	-13697	1440798941	awakened	Any fans of Bashar?	If you know him you know how 'out there it' is (no pun intended), It's about a man who claims can make telepathic contact with an advanced ET being.So why would anyone belief this? Well he does give very direct answers to everyone who asks him anything, without hesitation, and not just vague answers but actual direct information. I've seen a lot of material and everyone always walked away pleased, even scientists and doctors and such.I would just recommend to make up your own mind of course, research him yourself, here is an interesting video for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iRU-jLkcssSo I am quite the fan even though I can't always agree with what he says, I do belief him a 100%, also because of a personal experience that I had where I saw something very specific in a dream that was also shown in one of his talks a week later, wrote about it here http://bashar-forum.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=7 on a kind of fan forum I made.Me and some others will have a private session in a few months probably, and we are also taking good questions we could ask for you. =)There is also a subreddit about this made by /u/mat3j called /r/Essassani 
3iu3u4	-13697	1440848111	Essassani	Transcribed most of Bashar's predictions for the fall of 2016	As many of you know, Bashar, about one year ago, said that everything will change in the fall of 2016. This video is a elaboration on that prediction on what they sense the energy will bring at that time.This is the link https://soundcloud.com/user736545234/ba ... 2014-12-07 (the reading of the energy starts at 12 min or so), it's from December 7th 2014.I thought it would be a good idea also to write the predictions down so there is a clearer overview of what has been said. I didn't take everything over literally, so to get the most precise information please listen to it directly. 1. 'Between your yours 2015 and 2017, and now with highest probablity vocal point being sometime aroud the fall of 2016; your world will in some way shape or form finally realize that ET in some form is a fact. [...] Again I remind you, not to embellish this, we are simply saying that you will discover that life exists on other planets, it might a planet in your own solar system and it might be something as simple as an amoeba, but you will know it exists. [...] You will know that means that ET life is highly probable, that will begin to change the mindset of your entire reality. The probability factor of this happening between 2015 and 2017 is 98%.'2. 'You will also begin to experience certain things happening within different potions of your infrastructure of your society, because many of you are eager to transform different sociological aspects of your society in different ways, you will that some of this this will also accelerate, and one of the ways you may begin to experience this, sometime again around the fall of 2016 is the highest probability, of about 75% to 80%, is that you will have an abrupt change in your economic system, you may experience what you call a great economic downturn,once again, how ever, the positive side of this, is that it will create a different mindset about the idea of economics, that will begin with a very strong upsurge from a large contingent in your society and in particular in your NA culture, where you will begin to to finally let it be ok to explore different ways to begin arranging your economic system, but one of the first things that will happen, after this particular contraction, will be the complete revamping of your taxation system. To allow your society to re-balance it self and get back on it's feet, and this will cause a directional surge, like a wave of energy, that will have incredible repercussions in your following years, so that by your your of 2020 you will find that many things in your economic system that no longer work for you will really begin to fall away and that new systems will begin to be discussed and be put in place in the beginning of that time frame, so that by your yours of 2025 to 2030 you will have completely revamped you economic system in a way that will allow you to function far more easily in your planetary global system. This again has a factor, going towards the year of 2020 of about 87% to 95 %, beginning with this contraction in your economic system, somewhere around the fall of 2016.'3. In your political system you may find that things, in 2016, may first at first appearto just be same old, same old, but that will set the stage for something that we have just talked about in terms of the revamping of your taxation and economic system. And then in your year of 2020 you yourself will create about at about an 88% probability as we sense it now, a new completely historic event in the idea of your political system. 4. We will find, also, in what you call your scientific realms, in this window of 2015 to 2016 and up to the years of 2020 and 2025 a high degree of probability that you will finally allow yourself to have the first hints and indications of something that can really be practical and effective on your planet as a alternative energy system that can be mass produced and allow for the beginnings of the understand of tapping into the idea of what call free energy. It will be an infant representation at first but it will mature very rapidly over the next 10 years following.5. But this will also be predicated with a contraction where it is very likely that between now and sometimes between 2017, 2018 maybe 2019 at last, there is a high degree of probability that there is going to be another relatively devastating terrorist action, this turn things around in a variety of ways, or at least will begin to. 6. In the same tone of the contraction energy, you will also find that between now and your years of 2020 that there is a very very high degree of likelihood, stretching almost a 100%, just shy of it, that you will also have another nuclear melt down.7. These things in combination will spur the expansion into new directions that will allow for the final allowance of the beginnings of new forms of energy on your planet. New ways of doing things where you will finally clean your slate. Start from zero in certain areas, in science, and in politics, and in sociality and where you really begin to investigate in all seriousness the idea that you must start walking down new paths and start to pull together new ways that will allow you in working together to come up with things much more rapidly than you here to for have believed you were capable of. It will usher in a new age some time around 2020 that was similar to your idea of what you call your space race in the 1960's where you know that only in one decade you went from no space travel capability to landing on the moon. And so you will in 2020 usher in a another era like this, where you will find that in that decade of 2020 to 2030 you will find inventions and capabilities that you never believed possible will start springing up on your planet and in working together you will find that you will be capable of abilities and adventures far beyond what you thought your societies were capable of. Because you finally be focusing yourself in a way where you will use your resources in a coordinated way you did back then and when you do that you are capable of almost anything. That will really turn things around and accelerate the ideas of open contact so that you will finish out the window of 2030 to 2033 having an absolute understand of disclosure of our existence and open contact beginning in earnest, where most people of your planet will be well aware that beings from other civilizations are now in contact with your civilization.This is what is said up until 21:30, it took a bit more work than I thought hehe. There are a few more predictions about the rising of the sea levels, temperature, a high probability of finding the last hall of records of Atlantis, a large percentage of what has been lost in the library of Alexandria will be re-found.https://soundcloud.com/user736545234/ba ... 2014-12-07Also, at the end of September in this year, there will be another session dedicated to this idea called '13 months and counting'. =)from: http://bashar-forum.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=13

So say if you have two guys fighting at 135 but they both naturally weigh around 155 they can agree to weigh in at like 150 or what ever. The only real problem I could see would be people who do huge cuts getting shit from lower weigh guys. Just an idea though.

For the last year, my father has been distilling his own bourbon, so for christmas I have been trying to come up with some event or tour that he and I could go to. I was thinking of paying for a trip for the two of us to the Bourbon Trail, but that might be prohibitively expensive (round-trip flights from two cities, lodging, car rental, etc). I've noted the Kentucky Bourbon Festival, however it's not till September, which I think would make it slightly less impactful as a "christmas gift."Does anyone know of anything else worth exploring? Of particular interest would be events where he might be able to present his bourbon, or events on the East coast (anywhere between VA and NYC).The Manhattan Cocktail Classic is on my radar, but I thought I'd solicit options that aren't as convenient for me.Thanks for any advice!

I've never done a giveaway before and I was wondering if people would be interested in my electrikes.The electrikes are all timid natured with a mix of static and lightningrod. Their egg moves are discharge, eerie impulse, electro ball, switcheroo. Some don't have electro ball as I started breeding that a bit later, but as I breed more the majority will have it soon. They're just filling up my boxes and I have a difficulty just releasing pokemon with 4IVs+. xD So yeah, let me know with a comment and if there's a good interest, I'll host it tomorrow or on Saturday via GTS.

There is a mixture of static and lightningrod and males and females.----To receive a electrike, deposit a scatterbug in the GTS with a message of "TARANH." Please list your IGN in the comments. Thanks! Electrikes will be sent out in the box order I put them in from top to bottom. May you receive a nice gift!If your deposit gets snatched, no worries. I will give you one. If I run out, I will breed you a random one from these electrike's parents.

This is a giveaway, so it can be a scatterbug, fletchling, pikachu... If you want to help me, I like scatterbugs more, but any poke is fine.Make the GTS message "Taranh!" so I can find you! :D List your IGN in the comments.**Make sure to tell me which pokemon you deposit***Don't deposit vivillon, they are snatched up like gold*

[?] **Edit:** Cool, I definitely see enough people are interested. :D I'll be catching four full sets of unown and giving them away as soon as I do. Some might be in apricorn balls, but it seems kid me didn't care too much about that so I only have a few on hand. xD Making apricorn balls takes at least a day for a certain kind... between catching the unowns and transfering, I'm a bit too lazy for that much of customization. xDD Sorry guys.So I'm kinda tired of people asking arms and legs for unown letters online when they are just that, letters. I still have HeartGold and I am willing to transfer unowns to gen 5 to gen 6. I completed my unown collection, so just wondering if there would be an interest while I catch these dudes. Thanks. :)

1xo4ou	-13759	1392170656	Vivillon	Casual Vivillon Discussion	Hi, vivillon collectors! I just thought I would post a casual discussion thread about these neat bug 'mons to change the usual trading norm.----So anyway as we all know, there are eighteen patterns of vivillon. They are as follows: modern, high plains, polar, sun, elegant, continental, garden, meadow, marine, river, tundra, savannah, jungle, monsoon, archipelago, sandstorm, ocean, and icy snow.So I got some questions for you all! :D- What is your favourite pattern? Least favourite?-  Design-wise, which pattern do you think is the best of the bunch and which one is not the best of all?- Which pattern do you think is the most difficult for collectors to find and which one is the easiest?- If you play competively, do you think vivillon is viable for battling? If so, how and what kind of tier? ----If you're curious about my answers:- Marine is my favourite because blue is numba one! Plus it's nicely balanced not too overly cluttered. My least favourite of the bunch is sandstorm. I dunno, I just don't care too much for it design wise or personal taste.- Personally design wise, I think either monsoon or sun is the best. I don't care too much about sandstorm for the browns or ocean because it seems too cluttered compared to the other vivillons.- Sandstorm is by far the most difficult pattern to obtain both on here and especially via the GTS. Not once have I ever seen a reasonable sandstorm vivillon trade on GTS, if anyone is trading it at all. In contrast, however, I believe elegant is the easiest to get. Just look at the GTS and you'll see my reasoning.- Competitively... in NU or UU possibly, I have yet to test out my vivillon. It has great SpA and access to quiver dance and STAB hurricance, but its speed and defenses are less than par for OU. It's a great sweeper, just make sure it can have a chance to dance! ----On a side note, once I amass enough vivillon, I plan to do giveaway. :) Sometime during this week. I have a one box of various patterns at the moment.

20ae3y	-13759	1394678675	Pokemongiveaway	[GTS] 2-5V Lure Ball Adamant Magikarps	[sg]Status: Offline for the night.--Hi, everyone, I'm breeding for a shiny lure ball gyarados and I have some non-shiny baby karps lying around. I have 18 females and 22 males with varying IVs. I did not check every karp, so I do not know which karp has what.There are probably only 1-3 2V karps honestly. They are guarenteed to be male, all females will have at least 3-5Vs.Three females were used for breeding so they aren't level one, but are still good if you receive them!Each magikarp will have "Kylie" as the OT. If you receive a karp without my IGN, your pokemon was snatched before I could get it. If that happens, please redeposit and post a new comment on this thread so I will see it. :)-**How to Get A Magikarp*** Deposit an unwanted pokemon into the GTS with your message as "Taranh" so I can find your trade. If you don't write this GTS message, I will probably not find your trade on GTS. * Post a comment on this thread with your IGN and what your deposited. Please let me know if you prefer female or male or you do not care which gender you receive.* Not a requirement, but do not deposit starters or scatterbugs. Pidgeys and luvdiscs are ideal because they are easily found and have a low chance to be snatched unlike starters and scatterbugs. Post them if you like, but don't complain if they do end up getting snatched before I find them.* Enjoy the karp! :)

3hhi9w	-13759	1439926500	AnimalCrossing	Found a neat way to sell items in retail fast	I dunno if this is a known method, but I've recently discovered it in my time replaying the game.First, I'll put all my items up for sale in retail. I'll then wait for the first villager to come in and buy something. After that, I will go to the train station, look in my locker, then immediately leave. I'm not sure if the locker part matters. I will then go back to retail and the previous villager will be gone! Usually you have to wait a awhile for them to leave after they bought something, but going to the train station apparently makes them leave quickly. After that all you gotta do is wait for a new villager to come in and then rinse/repeat until every villager has bought something for the day. So you can sell 10 items per day if you have max villagers!If I have ten gems and ten villagers, I can usually sell all ten gems for 7,999 each abusing the train station trick here. Which makes 79,990 for the day! And if you use foriegn fruit, that makes even more! 5 oranges in a basket, for example, in a apple native town can sell in retail for a max of 9,999. So if you sell 10 each day, that would net you 99,999 bells!Hope that helps some people make some quick bells whenever beetle/whale hunting gets too tedious.

I've been trying to get into fairy tail for a bit now, and while I thought the first 25-30 ish episodes were decent enough this "tower of heaven" arc has just been **painful** to get through. Does the series get any better?Edit: thanks for the help guys, I think I'll try to power through this arc and see how I like what comes next, I'll stop if I still dislike it.

27hu6q	-13764	1402083693	Paranormal	Shadow People?	Can anyone give explanation to this phenomenon? I posted in the thread about the creepiest thing you've seen and this one came to mind. I googled it again and started reading and after looking at pictures, the "hat man" is pretty much exactly what I saw. Here was my post:I had a weird stretch of time where I would wake up in the middle of the night and see figures... later I learned they are called "shadow people"It only happened for about a year, maybe once or twice a week - but felt like the most real thing ever. It would happen at different places (my house, my dads house and my gf's apartment) and I would basically wake up in that dreamy-daze state and see a figure hovering over me or a few feet away. I never felt in any danger...I don't believe in God, ghosts or any of this stuff and I still don't know what the real deal was. However, one particular time was very creepy - I was staying at my dads and woke up to:Door opened and my dad was there, probably just seeing if I was asleep. This woke me up and when the door closed, I saw that stringy haired top hat wearing figure in the corner rocking back and forth in a crouching position (where the hinges to the door are). I sat up and looked closer and it never disappeared - that was usually the way I could make them disappear after 3-4 seconds.This went on for probably 15 seconds, the longest I ever had. Then it simply disappeared. I never see these anymore but it was the most real "entity" type thing I have ever seen. Who knows what it really was... I was never in fear or scared, just startled. This particular instance was the only truly scary one because it wouldn't disappear after I was TOTALLY awake and sitting up.

I deducted my HOA, taxes, mileage etc but turbotax did not have any input field for my mortgage payments (condo is not paid off)I have to call the rental payments "Wages &amp; Income" (about 14k) but I also spend $6500 in mortgage principal. Can I deduct this as an expense? There is an "Other Expenses" field.Just doesn't seem right that I deduct PMI, interest, taxes, HOA, mileage but not the principal of the loan.

I finally decided I want to try to figure out the problem.1. Using Firefox, Safari and Chrome, all browsers seem to randomly "hang" when I go to google.com... 95% of the time it works, but will randomly not work in the middle of googling whatever. I can try to open a different browser and it still fails, but if I try yahoo.com it goes there no problem. I have a windows laptop that has never had that problem, so I'm not sure if ISP could really be the problem.2. IRC will timeout every 120 seconds if I use a client such as Colloquy or Limechat - but if I open a browser based IRC like mibbit, it stays connected. At first I thought it could be the client, but after trying both and having the same issue, I feel it is an internet or connection problem?Hope someone can help, it is so annoying when both of these happen daily!

We recently set up our Twitch channel and have been slowly improving stream elements. We’re also grateful that the Mac Twitch community is gaining more support, though there were some pieces that were a little more difficult to configure. Our hope is that his guide will help those looking to improve their streams whether using a PC or a Mac.One thing we knew we wanted to have was overlays showing new followers and potential donations. There are many options out there (TwitchAlerts, TNotifier, Streamtip, etc,) though we found TwitchAlerts had the features that we were looking for, including Stream Labels.Eager to set it up, we started through the process and stopped immediately when we saw this:[Not supported!](http://i.imgur.com/spI9aMS.png)Luckily after some googling, we learned that there is a Google Chrome App for TwitchAlerts Stream Labels that works on any multiplatform. Sweet![TwitchAlerts Stream Labels on a Mac](http://i.imgur.com/Vkx910r.png)After going through this workaround we were feeling pretty good about the ability to show information in our stream, until we found result after result that we couldn’t use scrolling text using OBS on a Mac.[No scrolling text allowed!](http://i.imgur.com/XVgHFbi.png)We even tried building some html documents with and implementing them, but it was more work than it seemed worth. We almost gave up at this point after seeing the recent posts that it wasn’t currently possible, when we discovered a way to make scrolling text possible!![First step is to add a new text source.](http://i.imgur.com/GPtUI9C.png)[Name the source.](http://i.imgur.com/V0SSsue.png)[Input text, or import text from a file produced by TwitchAlerts.](http://i.imgur.com/OfMMmgM.png)[Now we have to make this static text move by adding a filter.](http://i.imgur.com/rVcxjIa.png)[Awww Yeah!!!](http://i.imgur.com/p8GuikO.png)[And adjust settings to your liking.](http://i.imgur.com/hGWYkKm.png)**EDIT:** [We're happy with the result on how we have it currently set up.](http://i.imgur.com/fsseZYt.png)We really hope this helps for anyone using OBS Multiplatform.

As such, traffic sucks and I'm looking to move back downtown. I kind of have a bug to get a condo downtown. As a matter of fact, I'm looking at one on 3rd Ave N tomorrow. My question is for any loft/condo dwellers who have dogs. How big of a pain is it to walk your dog, especially with no parks readily close by? I'm used to having a back yard that I can just let her out. She's a 75-80lbs Lab, and I'm just concerned about how that is going to work out. The building I'm looking at has a decent spot in the parking area for letting her out to do her business, but I realize that at least once a day she'll need a nice long proper walk.
299w2t	-13793	1403904700	sysadmin	Cheap/free desktop inventory apps for a small university IT shop?	Hey guys, I work at a fairly large university and recently moved from being one person on a staff of 12 at an IT shop that covered many departments to being the *only* guy that does everything technology related for an independent department. I'm finding it difficult to cope with the budget situation and the lack of tools that I had before (like Dell KACE or Altiris) to manage my desktops. What I really need, more than anything, is some way to inventory machines and keep tabs on them. What I'm looking for is to hand-roll some things, but I need a reliable way to gather info from my machines. The ideal solution would be an app I can put on my Windows machines that will gather all the information I need (inventory info like CPU/Memory/disk space/IP address(es)/installed software), spit it out in an XML file, and submit it to me in some fashion. Then I can parse/save the data in my own database as I see fit.OR,What are other folks doing in a small shop like this? I'm responsible for everything from desktop support, our few file servers, conference room AV, computers connected to scientific equipment, our department website, our Twitter feed, you name it. I want to try to automate as much as possible, as much as I had in my last department, but the size of the IT budget is smaller, to say the least.
2atlm8	-13793	1405477003	sysadmin	New to ZFS/Nexenta. Validate my backup plans to help me sleep at night	I've recently taken a job where I'm inheriting a situation that isn't a disaster but makes me uncomfortable. I have three file servers, a Mac (AFP and SMB), and two Windows (2008, 2008R2). Altogether I have about 4 TB in use and 8 TB capacity between them, but two are at capacity and are out of warranty, and the other is a Mac that I really want to re-purpose for Mac things like Profile Manager and Open Directory. Also, my backup situation is simply running Robocopy to mirror the files once a week to an external hard drive.Another group on campus (this is a university) has bought into ZFS and setup Nexenta and swear by it. I'm familiar with the functionality, having previous experience with a Dell Compellent SAN that does snapshotting, but ZFS now brings the "guaranteed no data corruption" feature to the table. My plan is to buy a couple of Nexenta boxes with 8TB of usable storage and replicate them, one serving as a SAN for a single Windows file server, and taking snapshots (probably 15 minutes for the past week, daily for the past month, monthly for the past year, and one a year for 10 years). I'm used to having some kind of "real" backup like Backup Exec dumping to tape or otherwise. Am I asking for trouble? Anyone have experience with ZFS? How bulletproof is the data integrity? I don't want a block to get fscked and then replicated and I find out about it a year later when I need to recover something for the feds.Tell me what I want to do is sound DR for a small shop like mine so I can sleep well tonight.

As part of this, I'm working on some numbers of staffing ratios, primarily desktop tech support employees vs. number of desktops or number of end users. What are some of you guys' numbers in this area? I can easily figure out ratios for various departments internally, but would like to have some numbers externally too.
2ejdb8	-13793	1408981489	dragoncon	Site and app are...lacking..goal for the whole weekend is getting a SirPatStew autograph..when/where?	So, the Dragoncon site is lacking on info, and so is the app, about when and where Patrick Stewart will be available for autographs. I know his panel is at 1PM on Friday, but we're arriving by car in ATL about 11AM and who knows if we'll make it to badges and the panel in time.I'm primarily concerned with just getting an autograph and meeting him, not seeing the whole panel. The pocket guide has a room location for a walk of fame session, but when will that be? There doesn't seem to be a schedule for it.This is my first real dragoncon, I came in 2010 for saturday only and getting autographs became my "thing" and something that I want to try to work on this time around. If I get this one, the rest of the weekend is gravy.
2f4h8y	-13793	1409528887	dragoncon	Some (friendly) suggestions to the Dragoncon organizers	So, I don't want this to turn into a bitch fest, because Dragoncon is pretty awesome, and I had a lot of fun. It was my second Dragoncon (first in 2010) and first time that I (attempted) to stay all weekend. We ended up going home today (Sunday) because we did pretty much everything we wanted and half our friends cancelled or left even earlier.All of that out of the way, between 2010 and this year, I've noticed a few things:1: It is SUPER SUPER SUPER too crowded. There needs to be a discussion around putting a limit on the number of badges sold. Today and yesterday in the vendor area, if an emergency had happened, people would have died. Flat out.2: Volunteers need better training and better screening. I know it's hard to do when they don't get paid, but some of them were just flat out assholes. I know they don't get paid but we do pay to attend, so figure it out.3: The vendor area is way too small. AmericasMart is 23 stories. Rent more space (but spread out the vendors, more space does not instantly mean more vendors)4: There are way too many T-Shirt vendors, and the contacts people had two booths. I know they pay for those spots, but maybe there should be some editorial discretion thrown in as well. In 2010 I was much more impressed with the vendor area. For example, this year there were no vendors selling vintage video games. A dozen booths selling the same t-shirts is not compelling. There should be unique items that you can't buy every day online. Also, there were artists there, and authors signing books. Why not be more strict on putting artists in the art walk area and artists signing books in the author signing area (or art walk)5: The app sucks. There I said what everyone was thinking. The website needs WAY more information. It's EXTREMELY hard to find what you want to go to and when something is happening, especially when things are going to be open or when someone is going to be at their booth in the walk of fame. I know schedules are finicky and subject to last minute change, but there should be a page that you can click on that shows you a list of everyone scheduled in the walk of fame and their last known schedule. Task someone to update this page constantly through the con. Don't make it a PDF. Make it easy to find this page. Ask publicists to give you updated times as they know them. Something is better than the nothing we have now.6: Navigation should be better. I spent all day Friday on the very bottom of the Marriott in the author signing area thinking the walk of fame should be down there. Constantly ran into signs (especially in the vendor area) that said "such and such this way" and the way the sign was situated, could have been indicating 3 different paths.Again, I don't want this to sound like a bitch fest, I had a great time. There's just a few things that could be done to drastically improve an already great event. I hope others will reply with suggestions or tell me why I'm a jerk. I and my friends will (hopefully) be back next year and I hope it will be even better. At some point I might even consider volunteering myself, having put together events like LAN parties back in my college days, I know the work and effort that the folks are putting into it.
2gc3ls	-13793	1410658205	Scotland	Questions from an American. What's the point? UK vs. EU, Federalism, other questions	Howdy. I'm an American who likes to keep up with events happening in the world, and British politics have fascinated me for a long time. As a matter of fact, I'm watching the Nigel Farage/Nick Clegg debate as I type this post. I just have some questions, and I hope they don't come off as arrogant, I'm just trying to understand where everyone is coming from. First off, why is the Scottish government trying to become independent from the UK, but then will be running headstrong into the EU? What is the difference? It's obvious that over time the EU is going to become more federalized (at least from the outside it looks like that's the only way it can work). Is it purely because the EU is more "liberal" (from an American definition of the word liberal) vs. the more conservative English-dominated UK government?Secondly, if Scotland wants to keep the pound (with or without England's cooperation or permission) and wants to keep the Monarchy and wants to not have border controls with the rest of the UK, what is the point? What do you get out of independence? I know Scotland has its own Parliament that doesn't have as many powers as the "main" one, but I'm just confused what additional powers they'd get.It seems that devolution has happened in a janky, disjointed way across the UK. Why isn't there a discussion across the four countries about federalism, much like Canada or the US? Anyway, it's fascinating to watch from afar, and that a country would be willing to vote to break itself up. Not that I am calling any Scots crazy, but here in the US when folks talk about seceding, we usually call them nuts (and I say that as someone who lives in Alabama with some of those nuts) so this is just amazing for a politics nerd.
2hoi35	-13793	1411886705	RealEstate	Looking to buy a condo. What are the pitfalls, what should I look out for?	Hey guys, I am under contract to sell my house out in the suburbs and I'm looking to move closer to my job which is in the downtown area of my city (Birmingham, AL). I'm looking at buying a condo, but I'm curious what should I look out for? I've only owned one house, and had it for 5 years. I know when buying a single family home I need to get inspections, etc, but what do I need to do in terms of the condo, the building, inspections, investigating the management of the building and the owner of the building, what are my rights, and what could happen 5-10 years down the road I should worry about? How does maintenance work, what are the building owners, the condo association, and myself all responsible for? Any help or directions to resources would be appreciated. I'm still not 100% sure what I'm doing to do (house vs. condo vs. townhome) and I'm still grappling with the lifestyle changes (I have a dog, for example) but I want to start learning about the due diligence I need to do as well.

And, I figured if any high-volume subreddit would have folks who know the answer to this, it'd be you guys.I am about to buy an older house. The wiring is 2-wire, not grounded. Someone in the past came through and put in GFCIs and three prong outlets, but they're not grounded. My question is, how absolutely necessary is it that I get these grounded for my electronics and computers? I know that surge protectors won't work properly, but what if I use UPSes instead? Am I susceptible to minor things killing my electronics, or is it major surges that I need to worry about? I'm just wondering how hard I need to push to get a concession on price to get this repaired in rooms that I plan to have major electronics, like where my NAS/router and PC as well as in the living room at the TV.
2ozlmj	-13793	1418318466	Birmingham	Looking for a barber	I'm looking for suggestions for a good barber. A long time ago I got great haircuts from this guy that my grandfather had used for a long time. The guy was in his 80s, and eventually retired. After that I started going to chain "salons" or whatever and I'm fed up. Also, recently, I moved, so now I need a new place anyway.So, suggestions for a good, old fashioned barber? I don't need the full on pampering experience like that place on 280, I just want an old fashioned men's haircut. No special styling. No salon BS. just a haircut. from a barber.

So far, I think I will get it before today's promo is over.My question is, is there any way to setup automatic goals (if you're a Simple.com customer, think of it exactly like their goals)For example, I'd like to tell YNAB that I need $1000 for a yearly expense next december, and then have it automatically setup a budget every month between now and december to save up to that point. Unless I'm missing it, it looks like I need to figure out the monthly amount and setup the budget manually?

2uodlc	-13793	1422996599	ynab	Handling reimbursable expenses	Hey guys,I'm currently in month two of trying the YNAB way, and I'm mostly doing ok. My biggest pain point is having to enter transactions, but I get around to it every few days.Anyway, something that is making it hard to keep an eye on my actual spending is reimbursable expenses. For example, I have my brother, mother, and stepfather on my cell phone under a family plan. My parent's house is also in my name and while they pay the mortgage, I pay it for them and then they pay me back.So, my question is, does anyone else have these types of situations, and how do you handle it? I have a $300 entry for Verizon on my budget, but I'm only actually paying $120 myself, and I'm getting the rest reimbursed. It seems odd to count the reimbursements as income, but is that the best way to do it? I want to make sure I am tracking how much *I* spend on my cell phone or whatever else (for example our group of friends are going to a show this month and I bought everyone's tickets...I'll be doing the same for a road trip at the end of the summer).
2vo2cn	-13793	1423760837	TronScript	Feature request: settings outside of the script	First off let me say Tron is awesome. It saves me so much time when dealing with exploited or potentially exploited machines.I have a feature request, though. How about having Tron check for settings from an outside file, or perhaps even override certain things based on the contents of the outside file.Here's my use case, and why it goes beyond just setting up a command line shortcut or a batch file that launches Tron with the command line parameters:Tron currently patches Java to Java 8, but internally here we cannot upgrade beyond the latest Java 7 update. I also remove some other updates/patches like 7zip etc that I don't want to install on my users' machines. However, I don't want to completely wholesale skip patches because I do want flash, java, etc. to run in case they haven't gotten the updates via my normal patch distribution system. What I was doing before was just modifying Tron when I downloaded it but now that it's doing auto-updating, I'd like to use that functionality to update when I'm running it (instead of having to think to do it ahead of time) but then it wipes out all of my customizations.So, I haven't really thought out how it should work completely, everyone should provide some feedback here, but what about a file that is not part of the normal Tron package (so it won't be overwritten when it's updated) that lets me set any of the normal flags (such as EULA=yes, etc) and then even maybe has an additional stage that runs, where I can put in anything custom I want (like older Java updates).Thoughts?
2x0ozw	-13793	1424804664	homeautomation	Best slim wireless Z-Wave remotes OR best solution for single wire switches?	Hey guys, new to the sub but not new to HA. I recently moved back in November and I'm in the process of planning out some HA features for my house. I have a Vivint/2Gig Z-wave capable alarm and a Nest thermostat already. I haven't really worried about gluing those two pieces together yet.Anyway, because I have the Vivint alarm (due to a contract term moving the alarm from my old house) I figure sticking with Z-Wave as much as possible is probably the way to go. The downside, though, is that my "new" house is pretty old, and most of the switches just have one wire run, meaning no neutral for the switch.This leads me to a conundrum as to how to effectively automate the lighting in the house. I want to keep switches so that as I go from room to room I can turn lights on and off, but I also want to automate them. I'm thinking just remove the switches completely, and hardwire the circuit closed and put in some small Aeon Tech z-wave switches that fit in the box above the light. If anyone has a better suggestion of how to handle no-neutral switch wiring, please, I'm all ears.IF I do go down this path, though, I need *something* on the wall to act as a switch. does anyone have suggestions for some good, small, wall-mountable (even if I just velcro it to the wall) remotes that are Z-Wave compatible?

309amv	-13793	1427295550	homeautomation	Doorbell Discussion	My current doorbell is dumb, and it's also kind of quiet. My goal is to get a doorbell that I can hear anywhere in the house and also on the back deck, so that if I'm outside grilling, etc I know if someone's at the door. However I'd like to disable the outdoor tone when I'm not actually outside. So, my current HA setup is just some Z-Wave modules and an Alarm.com/2GIG alarm panel. I'm mostly a z-wave fan because that's what I've got and know. I'm also thinking of diving into the Logitech Harmony hub ecosystem. Finally, I have outdoor string lights controlled by a Z-Wave outlet that I can use to detect whether or not the outdoor tone should sound.So, with all that said, recommendations? pointers? I don't want one of these $200 wifi enabled video doorbells, but I do want something that I can at least somewhat tie into my budding HA network.
30pnvi	-13793	1427647859	RTLSDR	(Yet another) Help me identify this signal	Hey guys, sorry to pile on another "tell me what this is" thread, but I'm at a loss.http://i.imgur.com/ufTlhok.pnghttps://soundcloud.com/user104840734/sdrsharp-20150329-163754z-941200khz-afThis signal is on 941.200 Mhz, which is registered to my local power utility. Ran it against Unitrunker and it didn't decode any control channel, and ran it against PDW and it didn't decode as a pager, which I didn't expect. I also didn't expect a trunked radio system control channel because my local utility owns/operates an iDEN service.Any idea what this digital data is? It sounds like a trunked radio control channel except every 10 seconds or so there is a tone that seems to reset the signal.

Some friends of mine are awesome cooks, and it has spurred me into stepping up my game. Throw in the fact that I have a new house with a nice big deck, and the weather is getting to be just right, I'm going all in on BBQ.To this end, I want to get into smoking, and I'm looking for a smoker. I've pretty much narrowed it down to a Weber Smokey Mountain or a Pit Barrel Cooker. http://amazingribs.com/bbq_equipment_reviews_ratings/smoker-pizza-oven/pit-barrel-cookerI'm leaning towards the PBC because at the same price as an 18" WSM, I can cook a LOT more meat, and it seems to be simpler to operate and harder to screw up.My questions are, which one would you guys suggest for a total newbie, not just to BBQ and smoking, but to cooking in general? Feel free to offer a suggestion other than the PBC or WSM. I want to cook pretty much everything, including ribs, brisket, pork butts, etc. What kind of gotchas do I need to be on the lookout for? Any other tips would also be tremendously appreciated.EDIT: I am planning on also buying a simple Weber kettle for regular grilling, but open to tips/suggestions there as well. I have a gas grill that I will eventually get back into working order, but for now is toast due to my dog chewing up the lines.
34ey2p	-13793	1430410484	sysadmin	Migrating file shares from Mac OS X Server to Windows...weird unicode file name issues	So hopefully someone here has seen this and has a good workaround. If not I'm going to be stuck fixing hundreds of file names...I am working to migrate a small department's file shares from Mac OS X server to a new, consolidated Windows-based file server. Most things are moving over just fine, but I'm coming across some problems.Some of the files have weird unicode characters in the path...either in one of the folder names of the path or the file name. In Finder on the Mac, they're showing up as "Last Resort" glyphs (what the OS uses when it can't figure out what to show you in your current font) and if I browse to the file in Windows, it is usually showing up as a bullet. If it's a folder, I can see the folder but cannot open it. If it's a file I can't open it.These are old shares that have been migrated over and over from many servers over many years. Is there a way to go through and strip out unicode characters from folder or file names? I've tried both RichCopy and Robocopy, and the fact that Explorer shits itself leads me to believe there's nothing that's going to reliably copy these files without me changing the file names.

I built a gaming PC at the end of 2012 and I think it's time for a refresh. I want to reuse this box for some other stuff, so I want to build a whole new PC.I generally don't keep up with everything between builds like I did back in high school/college. I don't know what's the latest GPU and CPU generations. GPU stuff is easy enough to catch up on, but CPU stuff takes a good bit of work to understand what's out now, what's coming and when, and what the next gen will offer.So, my question and prompt for discussion:I know Intel has been delayed in their latest generation of CPUs. Should I buy now or wait a couple of months? I want something that is going to be good for a solid 3 years. What's the next gen going to bring to the table in terms of performance? How long will I need to wait?

Last year was my first year being there all weekend (previously I had only gone on Saturday and then went back home). Anyway, we kind of got screwed by being put into the club rooms which are tiny. This year I made sure that our reservations were in the "regular" double queen rooms. No one can really tell me the size, nor does their website say anything about the size. How comfortable/uncomfortable is a regular double queen at the Sheraton going to be for 5 people? Our goal is to have everyone on a rollaway, regular bed, or air mattress. Also, do the regular rooms have wired internet? The club rooms did not have any internet at all.Beyond that, how horrible would those rooms be if we squeezed in more than 5? I have two rooms and 8 folks right now, but we have two groups: one set wants "comfortable" and cap the room at 5 people, the other group wants "cheap" and is willing to cram people in until the fire marshall is summoned so we're trying to gauge how many more people to offer spots.
3ctos8	-13793	1436552032	sysadmin	Google Apps for Business email and AD authentication question(s)	So I am a few months into a new job at a smallish mid-sized company (150 users) and the one of the upcoming projects is going to be email replacement. We have an aging Exchange infrastructure, coupled with the fact that I'm not an Exchange admin, and my (non-technical) boss is all about "cloud", since he'd rather roll up a per-employee fee into their costs than spend $75k to upgrade Exchange.So, we're probably going to go hosted. We haven't decided Google vs. Office 365 yet. One possible factor in our decision is our AD infrastructure. Our AD is in bad shape, in terms of not being cleaned up when people leave, and the UPN is for an old company that doesn't exist anymore (acquisition). I'd like to take the opportunity, if we decide to go with Google, to work our way into a brand new greenfield Active Directory. All of this leads me to a question about authenticating Google email users against Active Directory. Basically, is it possible to authenticate against two different ADs, and is it possible to switch the AD user attached to a given Google account after that account has been created? Wondering if the path would/should be move everyone to Google first and then slowly migrate users to the new AD, or, move them to the new AD as part of the migration to Google. 
3dj6nv	-13793	1437071038	sysadmin	Outlook constantly asking for credentials (Exchange 2010) after outage	Hey guys, I'm kind of at my wit's end trying to figure out a weird problem we're having. We're on Exchange 2010, with two mailbox servers and two hub/CAS servers servers.Tuesday night we had a power outage that outlasted our UPSes, and everything went down. Once power was restored, everything came up just fine, with the exception of needing to reboot one of the mailbox servers a second time and forcing the DBs to mount. Once that was done, though, all mailboxes were online, OWA was working, and MAPI connectivity appeared to be working.Fast forward to the next day and I have some users whose Outlook clients (not OWA) are constantly asking for their credentials. These are domain-joined machines, and a reboot of the desktop does not resolve the problem.I thought it might be some weird AD authentication issue, so last night I rebooted all of the DCs, one by one, and then rebooted both the hub/cas servers. Today, even after rebooting their desktops, some users are still getting the same behavior.Some of the users' Outlook is crashing, some never come online. I've been nuking the account from their profile and re-adding, and that at least gets them back online, but at the beginning it asks for their credentials (even though they are domain joined), and I'm afraid they may still be getting prompted for credentials and not reporting it. All of the users appear to be on mailboxes isolated to the same mailbox and hub/cas servers, users on the other mailbox and cas/hub server do not appear to have any trouble. I'm not an Exchange admin, we're a small company, and I inherited the Exchange infrastructure when I took this job a few months ago. Migrating to Office 365 is on the roadmap, but I'm not there yet.So, any help you guys can give me on what to look into and what might be causing this behavior would be great.**EDIT**: After further investigation it looks like it is happening to everyone (so not isolated to a certain mailbox server or CAS server). If we rebuild their profile in Outlook, it only asks once, at the startup of Outlook, and doesn't ask again until Outlook is quit and opened again.

I am two months into a new job and I'm trying to wrap my head around some things that need fixing, and that includes the network.There's two problems I'm hoping to solve, one is simply to upgrade to gig to the desktops, and secondly, to consolidate down to one vendor if possible.The hitch is that on our main floor where 90% of the employees reside (which is on a different floor than the server room and network core) have 6 switches that each have 2 each 1 gig uplinks back downstairs, not fiber.. So, instead of one massive trunk going upstairs, I have 12 Cat5e runs going upstairs. Like I said, 90% of my employees are upstairs (about 115 desktops + 3-4 wireless access points)What would you guys suggest in this situation? Is there a good way to use those 12 copper links that are capable of 1G each, but I'm not sure they'd be capable of 10G. Should I investigate getting fiber run to that location? I want to be able to push 1 gig to each desktop, so I'm thinking 2 1g trunks to each switch isn't really going to cut it, is it?

(ugh)	I have a feeling that this is going nowhere, but I want to see if you guys might have some ideas...I inherited a company with two email systems. Most of the company is on Exchange 2010, all is fine there. However, we have one department that at some point went around IT and created their own domain name and signed up for Google Apps. Most folks still have their exchange account and dual fist their email.I'm working to slowly unwind the situation, but due to political realities I can't just put down my foot and say "you have to do it IT's way"So, the problem I am trying to resolve today is shared resources. Our conference rooms exist as room mailboxes in Exchange. The Google users want to be able to schedule against those calendars and also see free/busy info. Apparently this isn't supported directly within Google apps (only sharing free/busy with other real users, not room accounts). Additionally, we are subletting some space in our building soon so this would help with our tenants, too.Has anyone figured out a good solution for something like this?

All of our conference rooms have room accounts in Exchange. Great so far.However, we have a division/department who does business externally under a different name, and when they did that, they bought a new domain name and setup Google Apps instead of just routing their email into Exchange. Wrinkle: I need to find a solution for my Google Apps users to be able to schedule shared resources out of Exchange. Apparently the free/busy federation built into Google Apps will only work for Exchange users, not Exchange rooms. Anyone run into this type of situation before (whether it be different divisions, subsidiaries, or building tenants) or have suggestions?

Our primary email is on Exchange.As part of this, I'm working on creating procedures for routing their old Exchange email addresses out to their new Google-hosted accounts. A problem I'm running into is Google thinking that senders have been spoofed because the mail is coming from my outbound gateway instead of the original sender's server.My question is this: In Google Apps email, if I specify my outbound server as a gateway into our Google Apps instance and DISABLE "reject all mail not from gateway IPs" will that affect regular email that comes in directly from the rest of the internet at large? Will Google prejudice it's spam filter against mail that doesn't come in via the gateway? I'm just trying to get Google to look further down the chain of IPs in the message header before testing SPF.

And I don’t know much, but I know a few things. He wanted some advice, so I wrote him back. And then I figured I would just put this up for anybody who wants to read it.So. You graduated from school with a degree in theatre/film with a focus in dramatic writing. Awesome. You’ve undoubtedly got a solid grounding in the classics, probably across genres. And I’m sure you have a ton of passion for your art. But you didn’t ask about passion or the classics — you asked for some advice about the comedy bidness.I give you this advice with a few caveats:1.) I’m 31 years old, almost 32. I only became financially solvent/independent as a result of my art/work very recently. And make no mistake —I’ve got me some credit card and student loan debt. In other words: comedy and writing haven’t made me rich beyond my wildest dreams. But they have given me a way to make a living.2.) I don’t have health insurance. Personally, I think that’s important. And I tend to think that if people can afford health insurance, they are a Real Success (TM). So by that measure, I am not a Real Success (TM). But my therapist says I’m supposed to let go of that. Of course, she doesn’t accept health insurance anyway.3.) I’m not the most successful person I know, not by a long shot. In other words, I’m not the be-all end-all of advice. I strongly encourage you to write to people who are way more famous and rich than me and ask for their advice, too. Sometimes they are actually willing to share it!Alright, with that out of the way, here we go.Be nice. This is the most important rule of all. Say hello. Make eye contact. Make an effort to remember names. These things matter. Yes, you should be nice for the sake of being a good person, but this is also a filthy craven ladder-climbing tip. That intern at UCB who is taking your credit card information down for your Improv 101 class? She’s gonna be the first pair of eyes on your “The Daily Show” packet one day. Or she’s going to be the assistant at the casting agency who determines where your headshot goes in the pile of hopefuls.I try to be nice to most humans I meet. But right now I’m also remembering a time I was a meanie weenie to someone with whom I ended up working and interacting for years afterwards. I’ve always regretted how I behaved. Thankfully, I got to apologize, but we don’t always get that chance. It’s a small community. Be nice.Being nice doesn’t mean rolling over and taking it in the butt (unless you’re into that, which is great!) from an “agent” who demands money upfront to look at your work. Speaking of which…Never pay to play. If an “agent” or “manager” or “talent analyst” or whatever the fuck claims that you need to give them money before they look at your shit, tell them “No, thank you.” I’ve made this mistake in the past. It doesn’t get you shit, no matter how many people they claim they’ve gotten staff jobs on “SNL.” If connections could be bought by anything less than millions of dollars, we would all be super hooked-up. Also, I would be married to Joseph Gordon-Levitt and showrunning a program called “Kitten Time!” (Note: “Kitten Time!” would just be shots of me playing with kittens. It would run on HBO and win 18 Emmys.)Move to Los Angeles, Chicago or New York if that’s at all possible and connect with a comedy community there. When I was hemming and hawing about moving to Los Angeles from New York in order to more actively pursue TV writing, my brother said, “Sara, coal miners go where the coal is. Move to Los Angeles.” I could tell you that your TV writing career could really take off in Detroit or Austin or Milwaukee, and if you’ve got the connections and the luck and the drive, I guess it’s possible. But that’s not where they make the coal, right? (Note: if you want to write for film or stage, there’s more flexibility. And you can be a book writer any damn place you please. But you want to write comedy, and I believe you’d still benefit from being in one of the three comedy capitals of the United States.)I took classes at The PIT when I first moved to NYC. You can also try UCB or the Magnet. In Chicago, check out the Annoyance, Improv Olympic, or Second City. In Los Angeles, there’s UCB West, Improv Olympic West, the Groundlings, and much more. It’s how you can network, meet people with similar interests, and in some cases meet the folks who will one day hire you (this is a point my friend Rob Delaney made once, and he’s so right). These places don’t just offer performance classes — in many cases, they offer sketch writing classes or even TV writing classes. And you’ll make friends in a new city. Friends in a new city are a precious and wonderful thing.Expect to put in years of work, much of it free, before you get a break. Now you may get a break faster than that, in which case, awesome! But be WILLING to put in the years of work. They don’t have to be super-painful years. For example, if you would dig having a well-paying corporate job and are willing to do the work that requires, go for it! It isn’t “selling out” to have health insurance and work in an office in a field unrelated to your dream. I know that may seem obvious to you, but sometimes I think artists get caught up in this idea that they need to have some kinda cool alterna-image to be a success. Not so. Most authors have day jobs. Even some folks with bestsellers still have “real” jobs. You haven’t “failed” if you’re not making a living off your art. You’ve only failed if you’ve given up on your art entirely because it’s not going to make you famous. If you love your art, you’ll do it no matter what. Even if you can only afford to devote an hour to it a week.Know that your life may look different than your friends’ lives, and be okay with that. I struggle with this sometimes. You’re a lot younger than me, and you’re a dude, which changes things a bit (some of it’s biology and some of it’s society, and I accepted it a long time ago.) For example, you don’t have to worry about your biological clock running out while you throw yourself into your career. That is AWESOME and you should cherish it! Your friends may get married and have kids before you do, but that’s okay. Your kids, if you choose to have them, will be happier with a creatively-fulfilled dad than with a dad who is full of regrets that he never went for his dream. Even if you fall short of your goals, you can still say you went for it, right? Plus, if you are a successful comedy writer, you can probably hook your kids up with cool shit like tickets to the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards, which will earn you endless points.Write fan letters. This kinda goes back to my earlier point. I received endless affirmation and validation when, as a beginning stand-up comic, I wrote to a famous comedy icon and she posted my letter on her blog. Don’t be afraid to tell people you think they are awesome. Don’t be afraid to ask them for tips. Just don’t say to anyone, ever, “How’d you get that?” It’s the most annoying question in the world and it implies that “getting that” (a spot on a house team at UCBT, an Emmy, a book deal, a date with Christina Hendricks) was the easiest thing in the world and that it required zero work. Most great success comes as a result of a combination of things: hard work and luck. I heard someone say once, “The luck doesn’t show up unless the hard work does.” And the tale of the hard work is often really long and winding and sometimes super-boring.You will meet everybody at least twice. Remember that letter I wrote to that famous comedy icon? Her manager’s assistant read it. A few years later, I wrote her another letter, and guess who read it? The same person — except now the assistant had moved up to be the manager. I included some links to my work, and she watched them and liked them. She was on tour with her client, and she emailed me to ask if I’d like to come see the show at Radio City Music Hall. Of course I said yes. We met up backstage, arranged a time to have brunch, and eventually I became her client, too. You just never know.Study. One of my most successful friends in comedy also has a near-encyclopedic knowledge of his favorite TV shows and stand-up routines. When I first started doing comedy, I sat down with DVDs of Cosby and Carlin and Bruce and Cho and Silverman and Bamford and Oswalt and Murphy and watched for hours. It helped me figure out what I wanted to do and say.Remember that sometimes dreams change, and that’s okay. I used to want to be a kickass successful professional stand-up comic. Over time, my dream changed to something I’d wanted to do since I was a little kid — write books. And then that dream expanded to writing and producing for television.Alright, that’s about all I’ve got. I hope it helps. Congratulations on completing your degree! Now write write write and write some more, and don’t stop writing until you’ll said everything you want to say. Break all your legs!Love,

15c8h4	-13797	1356294937	MMA	Here is how Johny Hendricks can get GSP.	That is, assuming Hendricks beats Ellenberger and GSP beats Diaz, yet UFC is reluctant to put two in the octagon.  The game plan is: Hendricks beats the living crap of Rory MacDonald in Montreal next, post fight interview disses Canadians, belittles their fighters and sport, calls out GSP.  UFC will have no choice at that point. Obviously it's predicated on that fact that he actually beats both Ellenberger and Rory.

15q4fh	-13797	1356966555	GetMotivated	How To Get Into “The Zone” and stay motivated.	This an an excerpt from  the blog post: [How To Get Into “The Zone”](http://www.liorgrossman.com/how-to-get-into-the-zone/)**The Secret: Getting Just The Right Amount Of Stimulation**The zone is a peak state where you’re positively immersed and focused in a single activity.The secret to getting into the zone is getting just the right amount of stimulation for the task at hand. This stimulation can either be internal or external. This so called “right” amount of stimulation depends on the person and on the task.When you’re under-stimulated, you feel apathy, fatigue, boredom, and lack of motivation.When you’re over-stimulated, you are anxious, nervous, irritable, and over excited.In either case, you’re not performing at your best, and you’re likely to procrastinate, lose focus, and achieve sub-optimal results.When you’re in the zone, you’re alert but calm, confident and motivated. You’re performing at your best, and do so effortlessly.Unfortunately, most people swing between over-stimulation (nervousness) and under-stimulation (boredom) throughout the day.Therefore, so you need to stay attentive to your body, thoughts and feelings to see how stimulated you are, and act accordantly.**1. Getting to Your Zone When You’re Nervous (Over-Stimulated)You’ll know you’re over-stimulated when:**•	You’re easily irritated by people, interruptions, noises and setbacks (for example, when I’m over-stimulated I often get angry at websites and computer programs)•	You’re feeling overwhelmed and don’t know how to cope.•	You have many thoughts running through your head.•	Your heart beats faster and harder than usual (this is the adrenaline pumping)•	You take fast and shallow breaths. In that case, use any of these steps to reduce anxiety and get into your zone:•	Get a short nap or break – sometimes a 10 minutes nap or walk outside is enough to “reset” your state and reduce some stress.•	Take slow, deep breathes – inhale for a few seconds then slowly let the air out by clinging your teeth and tongue, making a “sssss” sound as you exhale slowly. Repeat a few times.•	Chunk it down – you might be unconsciously anxious about the task at hand. Chunk it down to small, more manageable set of steps to reduce anxiety.•	Get stuff off your head – your mind might be loaded with many concerns – work, family, errands, finance, things to do, etc. Take a pen and paper and write those things down to allow your mind to focus on a single task.•	Take a shower – a good shower can be used to relax both your muscles and your mind.•	Think of something that relaxes you – a loved one, the seashore, a pleasant vacation you recently experienced.**2. Getting to Your Zone When You’re Bored (Under-Stimulated)**You’ll know you’re under-stimulated when:•	You feel bored, although you might have things to do.•	You feel sleepy and fatigued (for example, when under-stimulated I feel too weak to do anything, as if I’m out of emotional energy and will power)•	You’re indifferent, unmotivated and feeling low, even slightly depressed.•	You have a craving for sugary or salty foods.**In that case, use any of these steps to rev up and get into your zone:**•	Make the task more challenging – sometimes you get under stimulated when a task is too simple and dull. Look for ways to make it a bit more challenging, take it to the next level.•	Move your body – walk, run, dance, jump, do some exercises and get your body moving.•	Grab a snack or a drink – but be sure not to consume an excessive amount of sugar. The sugar rush will burn you out pretty fast.•	Leverage pain and pleasure – ask yourself: what kind of pain would I experience if I don’t get this task done? What kind of pleasure would I get by completing this task?•	Put on some loud music – whatever makes you upbeat and motivated. Use headphones for increased effect.•	Multitask for a short while – while multitasking is not optimal, it’s still better than no-tasking at all. Go and multitask for 5-15 minutes until you feel motivated again. Start a Facebook chat,open the TV or make a phone call. But use it sparingly until you’re back on track and don’t make this a habit.**Bottom line, here’s how to apply it:**1.	Next time you procrastinate or feel unfocused or unproductive, use the guide above to determine if you’re over or under stimulated.2.	Then, apply one or more of the methods to get back into your zone, until you’re feeling positive, motivated, focused and confident.3.	Be sure to use these methods in moderation, otherwise you’ll find yourself overshooting from under to over-stimulated, or vice versa. Keep in mind you need to get just the right amount of stimulation, not too much and not too little.

Perhaps it's no longer necessary, but I still give it a shot.It was a pleasure  moderating this board for the last ~1.5 years and  the opportunity to meet a bunch of you in process. Unfortunately my "rules"  and "practices" weren't aligned with the community as whole, and I imagine that frustrated many of you. As a moderator, I am accountable. You are doing  cool things, and you deserve the community that the *community* wants. I was getting in the way of that. It wasn't exactly a secret that for me community was more about lifestyle than PUA artistry. For those who are concerned about me, please don't be -- I love GothamSeddit and I'm terribly proud of what we've created (many friendships, lots of learning, fun, etc). I'm OK with having failed at this part of the journey.  And I am so lucky to have had the opportunity to take this far with all of you.If there's one piece of wisdom that this simple pilgrim would like to impart upon you: there is more to life than learning to bang indiscriminate amount of girls for the sake of banging. The life is incredibly rich and goes way beyond that. Make it fulfilling and enjoyable in  the areas that are important to you.My biggest regrets are the moments that I let my uncompromising way of thinking  override my intuition on what's best for you guys. This leadership change gives you some breathing room to break bad habits and  continue growing the group - don't waste the opportunity! Hopefully our paths have the opportunity to cross  and  we shoot the shit over one  drink or ten.Take care!Sleiveen

1h9qvf	-13797	1372450934	MMA	Renzo Gracie on Anderson... is he hyping up the fight or begrudges the success of the GOAT.	&gt;Renzo Gracie on Anderson 'The Spider' Silva: "Anderson is a guy that rubs many people the wrong way. He's not a humble guy. Even though he may speak humbly when he talks, when he's in the ring he doesn't act humble. He puts down his opponents. He acts in a way that again, we always know what is right and wrong, and by looking at that, we know it's wrong. It's like you can beat your opponent, but do it with respect."I certainly give Renzo the benefit of the doubt and  that his intention, much like GSP's,  is to create a lot of hype around his student (or rather the student of his student). However, it seems he is  begrudging the success of Anderson.  AS rises to a challenge every time he steps into the octagon.  He beats his opponents without breaking any rules (perhaps bones sometimes get shuttered).  That said, Renzo Gracie has the audacity to bad mouth and educated Silva on the Fighters' Ethics in the octagon. Really? Renzo who kicked Nate Marquardt in the face after the fight, and whose brothers, at one point or another, were very disrespectful. Furthermore, while Renzo is undoubtedly a great BJJ  instructor (**I trained at his school in NYC**) and practitioner, he hasn't accomplished much in MMA comparatively. Needless to say, it is low  for Renzo.  He paints both himself and his student in a horrible light.  Hope AS puts another Demian Maia and then finishes Weidman in some spectacularly embarrassing fashion.

3hcfye	-13797	1439836573	relationships	Me [32 M] with my ex-gf [27 F] dated for 1 year, 3 years ago. Met Again.	Three years  ago after our break up, we decided to meet for a drink and catch up. That was last week. Our evening at pub turned into the night,  and dinner and 4 drinks later,  we decided to continue  proceedings at my place. *I learned that I was her last boyfriend (due to her school, a year old illness  -nothing too serious and she is recovered now), while I had relationships, with the last 2 year long one ending a few months ago.* At my place, I tried to escalate , but she rebuffed and we continue to talk like two mature adults.  Since it was too late for her to go home, I offered to stay on the couch and she did. In the morning we had breakfast together and then went separate ways. Overall I enjoyed her company a lot and now considering giving another shot, assuming she wants it. * She didn't display much of affection and was cold when it came to any physical stuff. Understandable.  * I don't think she is a completely against us try again, but she was aloof and apprehensive, as she didn't want to give in. I don't know. I didn't ask her straightforward to try again ( but hinted a few times)* At some point during the evening, I suggested to have dinner with her mom (jokingly), something we'd done a few times before break up.  Two days ago, she e-mailed me, "My mom says that she's open to having lunch with you. Hope you're having a good day! :)"Now I am confused, while I don't mind having dinner with her and her mom, I don't want to confuse a poor lady. If she wants try dating again  then sure, but otherwise, it's just doesnt sound right to me.Anyway,  I don't know what to do. Please advise.   **tl;dr**:dates 3 years ago for a year. Broke up. Last weekend went for drinks. Now I want a relationship with her.

1h9h39	-13812	1372443516	SquaredCircle	I found pictures of the ECW Pennsylvania title (and possibly a good quality picture of it). [Follow up from my post the other day]	The other day, I made [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1h5du4/question_about_the_ecw_maryland_and_pennsylvania/) questioning the lack of pictures of both titles. I also asked anyone with the footage of the Pennsylvania championship matches to possibly upload it here. Another user made great points about how there's a good reason neither titles online, however by chance, I may have found one.I work on the Pro Wrestling Wiki a lot, and I made sure the two holders of the Pennsylvania title were up to standard with the other pages. (Way too many that aren't.) I decided to look up Tommy Cairo (Known for feuding with Sandman and being involved with the whole Sandman is blind angle.) I eventually came upon [this WWE.com page](http://www.wwe.com/classics/ecw/the-forgotten-stars-of-ecw-photos), I didn't think much of it, until I decided to reverse image search to see if this was the title, as he only held one in ECW. I found [this page](http://www.profightdb.com/wrestlers/tommy-cairo-1346.html) and quickly looked for any info on the title. I discovered that he lost the title to Tony Stetson at UltraClash 93. I quickled googled it, and found [this video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=bnERuz9cFrY#t=468s) (I linked to the time of the match) Sadly, but expected the video was in bad quality. However I still grabbed many shots of the title. [1] (http://i.imgur.com/4TeJU7A.png) [2](http://i.imgur.com/MxTLNqf.png)[3](http://i.imgur.com/JJLICHG.png) [4](http://i.imgur.com/TXkrrfD.png) [5](http://i.imgur.com/9gF0y1s.png) [6](http://i.imgur.com/K2opIky.png) [7](http://i.imgur.com/MZZKGZG.png)  [and also the picture I found on WWE.com](http://i.imgur.com/adP4LcA.png). I discover the title had five plates, and seemed to be all gold. However the only reason I'm relating the pictures to the one I found on WWE.com [is this](http://i.imgur.com/IDgTA57.png). It looks to be the same side plate. Even if I couldn't make out the main plate's features (From the video, there were split seconds where there seemed to be a globe and ribbons in their right places.) I believe I have found the first good picture of the belt. Though why the belt appears all gold in the video is beyond me. Neverless, I did find the title, and if the one in the WWE.com picture is the same belt, I also found a pretty good picture of it. Sorry for the length of this, but what do you guys think? Are the two title the same? Sadly I think finding the Maryland title online is nearly impossible, but small steps I suppose. EDIT: More evidence, the ribbons seem to match up too, [as seen here.](http://i.imgur.com/43Y4VXg.png)EDIT 2: [This video has more color to it](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x8v4s0_tony-stetson-vs-tommy-cairo_sport) EDIT 3: [The glorious championship](http://i.imgur.com/ujNtj8Z.png)

1hr44o	-13812	1373126869	adventuretime	With season 5 now half over, my only complaint so far..	The secondary main characters don't appear enough! In the first quarter of the season, LSP only appeared gender-bendered, and as a toy.  In the second quarter, she appeared twice again, in Princess Potluck and her, so far only major appearance, Candy Streets. That's only two actual physical appearances! Lady Rainicorn has so far been in only the first quarter of the season, with one major appearance in Jake the Dad. She also appeared as a toy, a cameo in Five More Short Graybles and in Up a Tree. Likewise Finn's girlfriend Flame Princess appeared only in the first quarter, mention in Puhoy, as a toy, and her only major appearance so far, in Vault of Bones.  Marcy, who is a more major character than the other three, is a little more fortunate, but not by much. She has had 5 major appearances so far, with only one in the second quarter, and 2 as her Farmworld version. Her only other appearance was as a toy. Ice King is the same, he has had 6 appearances also, 5 major and 1 minor. PB is more lucky. She has had 11 appearances so far, 5 major and 6 minor. However, only 4 of those were in the first quarter, and she only played a major role in one. It appeared she might have gone down the same road as the others, thankfully that wasn't the case.However, I liked how BMO is playing a more important role than ever before now. Also Finn and Jake missed their first episode, which was nice. The show has so many characters, so it was nice to see it, and I hope they do it more often. Also they brought back many previously one shot characters (Party God, Xergiok, Tiffany, the Squirrel, Abracadaniel and many other wizards),  gave time to other recurring characters (The Lemongrabs, Mr. Fox, Shelby, Tree Trunks, Neptr) and introduced many new characters (Jake's kids, the Magi, Jake's old crew) Overall the season has been great, and with a Marcy episode already confirmed, which also is going to have PB in it, I can't wait! I just hope we get more appearances from the secondary main characters!TL:DR - Secondary main characters didn't appear enough so far, but brought back plenty of other characters. Overall good season so far.

Should also be included, no doubt.) * [Both Over the Edge logos] (http://imgur.com/Ga3zZwF) (The second one is iffy, it was the logo it had when Owen died, but that shouldn't mean it'd be excluded.) * [All the Fully Loaded logos] (http://imgur.com/GlhFafv)* [Bad Blood](http://cdn.bleacherreport.net/images_root/slides/photos/000/881/625/Logo-bb04_display_image.jpg?1303438016)* [Invasion] (http://www.logoeps.com/wp-content/uploads/AutoGen/f2b9f39d43658e3416a0a7329d19de58.jpg)* [UK PPVs] (http://imgur.com/KhBQxm4)* Various ECW and WCW show and PPV logos.

The maker is hard to get in contact with.)* AWA: [World Tag Team Championship] (http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090925220426/prowrestling/images/6/67/AWA_World_Tag_Team_Championship.jpg) and  [World Light Heavyweight] (http://images.wikia.com/prowrestling/images/4/4f/AWA_Light_heavyweight.png) Also, the [Inmate] (http://www.davemillicanbelts.com/Inmate/AWAbigbelt2.jpg) is a popular belt, but it's a big maybe.

Also the 4 obscure single titles ([North American] (http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2GGUJdeEy5s/UMkBOefQE5I/AAAAAAAAFDk/Iajy5ckmJ5w/s1600/Mid-South_North_American_Heavyweight_Championship.jpg), [International Heavyweight] (http://prowrestling.wikia.com/wiki/File:WWF_International_Heavyweight_Championship.jpg), [World Martial Arts Heavyweight] (http://prowrestling.wikia.com/wiki/File:Wwf_martial_arts.jpg), and [Junior Heavyweight] (http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130630062213/prowrestling/images/thumb/1/1c/Title_display_image.jpg/200px-Title_display_image.jpg) or [this design of it] (http://prowrestling.wikia.com/wiki/File:WWF_Jr_heavyweight.jpg) would be all cool.

Like Sabu)Matches:* 3 team tag match (Doesn't go past the current 6 man limit, not sure why it isn't in yet.)* Slobber knocker match (A fun game mode IMO)* Casket match (Not sure why it's removed but Inferno matches are still in, has good chance to be re added)* 3 stages of hell WWE Universe:* Put multiple shows on one day (Be great for Monday Night War remakes)* PPVs on any day* Rosters on multiple shows* Smart booking (Meaning the game books based on what you do)* More than 4 championship slots on a show (2-3 secondary slots)* All women shows * Pick the number of matches per show/PPV General:* Blood stays on mat, but drips less* Custom music can be heard online* More CAW slots* More Paint tool slots* 8 men in the ring* Bring weapons to ring (Mop, Chair, Kendo stick, shopping cart full with weapons)* New weapons, including Mop and thumbtacks.

I'm using Canary by the way, if that matters.
1kax4e	-13812	1376426793	Nirvana	My rundown of the In Utero 20th track list.	Well the track list has finally been released, so I thought I'd give my opinions and thoughts about it. CD 1 - Original album/B-sides/Bonus tracks/Alt mixes:Very basic, it's the original album with the bonus track, b-sides, and some bonus tracks. Nothing special besides the alt mixes for HSB, All Apologies and Pennyroyal Tea (which was released already on Nirvana)CD 2 - 2013 album mix/Demos:Pretty disappointed about the waste of space with the 2013 mix, seems pretty unneeded. The demos are really interesting though, here's a list of each one. * Scentless Apprentice [Rio demo] (Unofficially released)* Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle [Laundry Room demo] (Instrumental track, unreleased and only track from that session)* Dumb [Word Of Mouth demo] (Unreleased, but there's three different versions recorded from this session)* Very Ape [Rio Demo] (Unofficially released)* Pennyroyal Tea [Word Of Mouth demo] (Unofficially released, two versions recorded at this session but both were instrumental) * Radio Friendly Unit Shifter [Word Of Mouth demo] (Unreleased and instrumental)  * tourette's [Word Of Mouth demo] (Unreleased and instrumental) * Marigold [Upland Studios demo)] (Released on Pocketwatch, Dave Grohl's side project released in 1992)* All Apologies [Music Source demo] (Unofficially released, has scratch vocals. May or may not drop out.)* Forgotten Tune [Rehearsal] (unreleased) * Jam [Word Of Mouth demo] (Officially released on With The Lights Out, as background audio on the DVD)Overall they did a good job on the demos, almost all of the tracks are new to Nirvana releases (and even then the jam was just background audio) Too bad they decided to include a remixed of the album, could have easily included more demos. * Rest of the Rio session (Onward Into Countless Battles, Seasons In The Sun, and HSB)* Some of the January 30th session at Robert Lang Studios (Jam After Dinner, one of the You Know You're Right demos, and the Jam)* The Instrumentals from the Pachyderm session. (Pennyroyal Tea, both HSB tracks, All Apologies, and Rape Me)CD 3 - MTV Live and Loud performance:Not much to say that's not in the title, it's the entire performance. Though banter between songs might be cut a bit. The Jam will probably be included on the Endless, Nameless track.DVD - MTV Live and Loud performance: They really spoiled us on this one. Finally the entire show is released from PRO #1b, some of the rehearsals (disappointed that the entire rehearsal wasn't included) Both versions of the HSB music video, the French TV performance, Serve the Servants from Italian TV (Really disappointed they didn't also include Dumb) and a few songs from the last concert. Wish they included the SNL songs (All tracks from the 23rd and 25th) but honestly the DVD doesn't suffer from the lack of them. Overall I think they did good on this release. I'm glad they didn't put already released stuff on this like they did with Nevermind 20th, but it'd had been nice they they released more demos instead of the remix. What is everyone else's opinions?

Anyway, the commercial aired recently, either in mid-late August or early September. I haven't seen in a while though. There's a protest in the background and the guy is talking about something. He sees a girl and asks her "Are those real?" and then get's slapped(?) to the ground and says something to her walking away.

1o0wzm	-13812	1381277710	thewalkingdead	[SPOILERS] After re-watching most of the series, something I noticed.	T Dog noticed everything! Seriously, here's a list of everything I noticed. 1. He pointed out the scratches Shane had on his cheek after his encounter with Lori in the CDC.2. He found the doll on the ground Daryl brought back after he was (barely) shot by Andrea in the head.3. He noticed the walkers Rick, Hershel, and Jimmy brought back to put in the barn.4. He was the first to see Randall in the car after Rick and the others came back.5. He later discovered Randall was missing when he was asked to go get him.6. After the group sat down in the house to rest, he saw the Walkers closing in on the house.7. Lastly, he saw that Axel and Oscar made their way over to the groups part of the prison.Anyone else notice this?
1ojb3d	-13812	1381879442	tipofmytongue	[TOMT][Movies] Movies from my childhood I briefly remember.	I've been trying to find a few movies for the longest time now, but no luck what so ever. All of these were at least before 2003, maybe even 2002 if that makes any difference. 1. All I remember was my mom didn't want me to watch this, but I did anyway. All I remember is a scene where a mom and daughter are driving on a road and see a man (maybe the dad?), and he (I think) was bloody and missing an arm and maybe even a leg? I think they get spooked and drive around him. Pretty sure this happened at the end.2. A war movie, might have been about WW1 since I remember the helmets being odd to me at the time. Anyway all I remember from it is this one soldier with a mustache is captured by the enemy, and is also forced to strip down to his underwear. 3. All I remember is two friends trying to find a princess, and it turns out to be one of the boys sister. Also takes place a lot in a tree house. I wish I could give more info, but since these were movies I seen once over 10 years ago as a kid it's amazing I even remember what I do.

So I downloaded a [Baryonyx skin](http://www.jplegacy.org/board/showthread.php?t=21391) a while ago and copied the Spinosaurus and re-named it Baryonyx. All that was easy enough, but for some reason the skin just wouldn't show up. I posted this on Jurassic Park Legacy and a kind user almost fixed it for me, sadly his internet wouldn't allow him to upload big files. (I sent him my Data folder by Mediafire). I asked him about 2 weeks ago what he did to fix it, but hasn't gotten back to me on it, so now I come here, hoping someone could help me. I followed multiple guides yet nothing has worked, and I'm not sure I can fix it on my end. I'm hoping someone might be able to take some time out of their day and figure just why the hell it doesn't work, and fix it for me. Everything for Baryonyx is under the name Bary. Link to folder - http://www.mediafire.com/download/5x8w1gzefsq8dnc/Data%20-%20Copy.rar (It may crash on start-up, but that's only because of something the guy suggested but didn't work, it usually starts up with a Spino and Bary, just w/o the skin)TL:DR - Messed up with modding a skin in the game, need someone to go in and figure out what's wrong.

1z5lyt	-13812	1393563732	tipofmytongue	[TOMT] [Internet stuff] A few things I can no longer find online	I posted this in that askreddit thread a little bit ago, but I'll guess I'll ask here with an extra thing.hree thingsFirst was a tribute video of Jessie and Jaden of Yu-Gi-Oh GX set to the song Pieces of me by I think Ashley Simpson. I loved it back in 08 and when I finally got Internet connection at home I made a YouTube account and added it to my favorites. It's since been taking offline, still can't find it.Second isn't really lost, but the video of the head banging ghost used to have actual audio that went with it. It's not hard to find on YouTube, but all I can ever find now is just one of those creepy songs placed over it, kind of kills the humor in it. [This one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL6eK-IWyw0)Another one was this video of a guy who i think got into a lawn mower accident. The guy who was injured is sitting in the garage and holding his leg, his friend comes over and asks how he's doing (I think) then they try to do something to the leg. Not sure why, but I feel like they decided to cut it off. I looked up leg cut off or something like that. Only video that made me winceLastly was this old game I played around 2004, a guys hand was strapped down and for some reason had to cut the fingers off to escape I think. Haven't found it since.

I get it, it's his photos and he can do whatever he wants right? I understand not wanting a website to re-produce your photos, however, he never put them on his own website. If you look, there's one picture of Kurt and Courtney, and that's it.  If you have no clue what I'm talking about (I don't expect you to) Michael Lavine requested his photos removed from the LiveNirvana photo archives, making most of his photos pretty much inaccessible.Now, to the point... I've managed to find a bit of his photos, which i'll provide imgur links to next to the LiveNirvana links. **However, the reason for this post is, I need help getting the rest! I don't mind how shit quality they are (I'm good at finding them in better quality), how little you have, anything is needed!**Here's the following sessions that he had with the band.[04/25/90](http://www.livenirvana.com/pics/9004ml/index-9004ml.html) the [ones I found..](http://imgur.com/a/Vgihs#0)[05/23/91](http://www.livenirvana.com/pics/9105ml/index-9105ml.html) the [ones I found..](http://imgur.com/a/KHAZj#0)[01/12/92](http://www.livenirvana.com/pics/9201ml2/index-9201ml2.html) the [ones I found..](http://imgur.com/a/VPMcG#0)[01/11/92](http://www.livenirvana.com/pics/9201ml/index-9201ml.html) the [ones I found..](http://imgur.com/a/r3a4f#0)If you can help out that'd be great!

22wlne	-13812	1397365456	tipofmytongue	[TOMT] [Movie] Movie about a girl that kills some of her family	I seen this movie a while back, so it's definitely not from this decade, probably an early 2000s movie, or maybe late 90s. Anyway, in the movie some girl kills some of her family members in different ways, including using a knife, and dropping a toaster/radio in the bathtub while someone is in it. She then later dies when a guy (or girl, but I think it was a guy) kills her with a pitchfork.

2cbf4p	-13812	1406877319	tipofmytongue	[TOMT] [Movie] An older Horror movie	Sorry about the crappy title, but I remember this movie that I've seen multiple times, yet I can't figure it out. Anyway, I remember a few notable things about this movie, but I haven't been able to look it up with any luck. Also, this movie is about some kind of gremlin/troll type creature I think, not too sure. Also, it came out in either the 90's or 80's, maybe even the early 2000's. Anyway, one scene that stands out is when the brother of the family is in his bed, and one of the creatures knocks down a jar of pennies/coins on to his head. I also think he blames the sister about it. I also remember the family cat goes missing, and the dad finds it in the lawn dead. One last detail I remember that the family get in contact with someone who lived in the house before, and she mentions something about her teddy bear. At the end of the film, as they're escape the house (I think it caught on fire?) she finds the teddy bear in the place they use to escape. Any clue what movie this is?

The only thing I can remember from it is that it says "Over and over again" and it's kind of a softer song, but is also a rock song. I'd like to say it came out in the mid 2000s. The part I can remember is in the chorus. Edit: My girlfriend actually found the song by random, it was Fall For You - Secondhand Serenade. Huh, I didn't even like it, but it was stuck in my head and I just had to find it.

380hhs	-13812	1433113628	Nirvana	What if Nirvana released a EP before Bleach?	So I'm sure as a lot of you know, many of the grunge bands released EPs before they released a studio album. This includes Soundgarden's *Screaming Life*, Mudhoney's *Superfuzz Bigmuff*, Green River's *Come on Down*, Mother Love Bone's *Shine*, and the U-Men's *U-Men* and *Stop Spinning*. So what if Nirvana released one, say in 1988? What tracks would be on it? What would it be called?Here's some songs I think would had made the EP. 1. Annorexorcist 1. Vendetagainst1. If You Must1. Blandest1. Pen Cap Chew1. DownerI checked using iTunes and it has about a run time of 19 minutes.I think the first 2 tracks are perfect for a debut EP. I honestly believe they would've gotten recorded after Pen Cap Chew had the tape no run out. Pen Cap Chew is a song that showcases Nirvana's early sound perfectly.Kurt hated If You Must, but I think it's another solid song. Another good showcase for Nirvana's early sound, and a hint of what was to come with Bleach.Blandest I'm not sure of honestly. The sound doesn't really fit, seems like it'd be better on the Blew EP, but at the same time I think it should be on there.Downer is one of Kurt's earliest songs, and one of the few that he took from Fecal Matter and re-recorded it with Nirvana. I think it makes sense that he'd put it on Nirvana's first release.What do you guys think?
38lhuk	-13812	1433462572	Nirvana	Confusion with the Fecal Matter demo	So I recently downloaded a good copy of the demo tape that some guy touched up himself (I'll link it if anyone wants it). However, I'm a bit confused about some of the songs, hopefully someone can help.So of course Spank Thru, Downer, Sound of Dentage, and Bambi Slaughter are all the right name, but it seems most of the songs are guesses and made up.After going through multiple downloads to see what's labeled what, I found a lot of songs named multiple things. I'll be going off of what I [have the tape in iTunes for names](http://i.imgur.com/tCNvjoW.png) (I split up the 7 tracks on the box with the rest of the stuff). Pay no attention to the first Control and the last two tracks, I still need to clean it up.* ~~*Laminated Effect* was called *Made Not Born* by Dale Crover, and LiveNirvana [can't seem to make up](http://www.livenirvana.com/sessions/home/easter-1986.php) their minds on [what it's called](http://www.livenirvana.com/songguide/laminated-effect.html). So is *Laminated Effect* the same as *Made Not Born*, or a different song all together?~~* ~~*Class Of '86* is often labeled *Buffy's Pregnant*, but I also seen people say *Class Of '86* is a song I have labeled as [*Punk Rocker*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPdQKuwRpHE). While I do believe that *Class Of '86* is the right name, I just want to see what others think.~~* ~~*Blather's Log* is often called *Vaseline*, and I also seen the song I have as [*Boatakk*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaD_sQIfP0U) being called *Blather's Log* as well. LiveNirvana also doesn't seem to recognize it being known, [as seen here.](http://www.livenirvana.com/sessions/home/easter-1986.php)~~* *Instramental* is a instrumental version of *Boatakk*, but of course it's also been called *Blather's Log*. I've seen it being combined with *Boatakk* as a "full" version, as seen [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZsDs4dgVgM) Should it be like that? Or should it not?* I've seen *Annorexorcist* also listed on a few downloads (the one I got didn't have it). I realized that it's the second half of the song on mine called *Love My Family*. Should it remain together, or split up?That's all my issues with it, can anyone help me out and clear some of the confusion up? Is my version of Fecal Matter demo correct? [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_Matter_%28band%29#Discography) caused a lot of this confusion, so sorry if this is stupid.Edit: Crossed some stuff out to show my main concerns. The other 3 were just questions I had.

The songs released yesterday gave us 4 new Nirvana songs to listen to! This includes an Alt take of *Old Age*, *Verse, Chorus, Verse*, a instrumental of *Heart-Shaped Box*, and what was possibly the holy grail for Nirvana fans, the Sound City *Sappy*.What do you hope gets released now? What's the new "holy grail" for Nirvana fans? Also, I'm not taking anything off that's set to be released on the upcoming solo album and MOH soundtrack. Once they both get released I'll post another update, hopefully I can remove a lot more soon. 
3fts6c	-13812	1438741625	Nirvana	Introducing: Bliss	I was actually planning this before the recent leaks, but hell they're going to make this a lot better! So after loving With The Lights Out and the fan made [The Chosen Rejects](http://wearethelastbeatniks.com/2012/03/29/nirvana-the-chosen-rejects/), I decided to do my own little "boxset" to finish off the Nirvana songs that weren't available officially or on TCR. Bliss, named after a early name used for Nirvana.  This isn't ready yet, but it's close. And it's meant to go along with With The Lights Out and The Chosen Rejects, so if you haven't got both of those already, I'd suggest you get them, but it's not needed. This will also not be put on CD, since I don't have the money to do that. This will be for download only, which also gives me the chance to add songs if more get released. Here is the "CDs" that'll be in the boxset, I'll release the track listing soon. CD 1 - Studio Demos and Alt MixesCD 2 - Home Demos, TV Appearances, and Radio SessionsCD 3 - Live Songs CD 4 - Live at the Paradiso DVD - Live at the ParadisoI chose to do the Paradiso show for a CD/DVD since it's one of my favorite shows, and seemed to be a perfect candidate for that.But, I do need your help! I need a cover for this. I want something that shows the rawness of Nirvana, and also something black and white to match the other two. I'll make sure you're credited in the release.  I also need people to submit live songs to include. So far, I've included 1. Verse, Chorus, Verse [Live at the Palladium, 8/17/1990]2. Do Nuts [Live in Nottingham, 10/27/1990]3. Vendetagainst (Come on Death) [Live at the Marquee Club, 9/28/1991]4. Nobody Knows I'm New Wave [Live in Buenos Aires, 10/30/1992]5. Come as You Are [Live in Buenos Aires, 10/30/1992]6. Ivy League [Live at the San Diego Sports Arena, 12/29/1993] 7. Where Did You Sleep Last Night? [Live in Paris, 2/14/1994]8. Heart-Shaped Box [Live in Munich, 3/1/1994]So please suggest your favorite live songs that hasn't been on any official releases or TCR, it would help a lot! 
3g2kq2	-13812	1438906564	Nirvana	Request for someone with the With The Lights Out DVD	Okay, so I do have this myself, but sadly my older laptop doesn't recognize DVDs or CDs as well as it used to. Basically, one the 4th scene selection menu, there's a portion of the jam (which you hear a longer portion on the 2nd menu) that I can't find online for the life of me. If anyone could record it in the highest quality possible, I'd be super thankful to you. This is for Bliss, which I'm sure some of you have saw that post. I'd be sure to thank you in the release of it. Thanks!

I'm faily new to the 30 relm.  I trun 31 in a couple weeks and that sadly is brining an end to the honey moon phase of being 30.  I really am in my 30s now huh? I don't know everyones story.  And, well, there's only a few of us here now (I think from the Atari post?).  But I for one am happy to be entering into the next decade of my life.  My 20s were great! Full of unexpected experiences brining me to places of the world I never thought I'd see.  Meeting and loosing the closest of friends.  When I look back at how amazing my time has been so far; I only get more excited for the future.  Truth be told, I still feel like a kid and couldn't be happier!  I guess there is no point to this post.  Just wanted to share here in the 30 something world.

qss5h	-13833	1331551442	beer	Today I get to travel to Westvleteren, Belgium!	I am excited! I've been living over here for a couple years now and this will be my first trip to get my own case of Westies (12).  I will be taking my camera, so I will have some good images to share later.  Has anyone had Westvleteren Beer before?  If so, what is your opinion?**UPDATE**: The trip was a success!!  Well mostly; I was a tag along with a friend who made the appointment.  He bought his cases and I got to get 2 three packs (1 blonde, one 8 and one 12) to take home.  I was hoping to see more of the monastery (or just a monk), but that is not open to the public.  There is a public restaurant/bar where you can enjoy all the Westy's you can handle with the added bonus of delectable edibles.    The experience was more than memorable. Not only was I excited over getting to enjoy this exclusive beer, but being at the physical location was enchanting.  This may have made the beer taste even better ;)  Exclusivity aside, the 12 delivers.  How they make it so smooth and flavorful while at a high alcohol percentage is a mystery to me. The crowd was mostly over 70.  I found that reassuring.  If you only had so many years left in life, wouldn't you want to spend it drinking the best beers with the best company?  Made the moment all the more special.So with out further adue, here are some of my pics from this momentous occasion:[The Stack](http://i.imgur.com/rdd8c.jpg)[Poured](http://i.imgur.com/YEjmA.jpg)[Religion](http://i.imgur.com/0F1N7.jpg)

Tonight is the night and after almost two years of being mentally out, I am going to tell my parents that I do not want to be a JW (I am not baptized). I was always waiting for the right time, but I have decided that there is no "right time" and I am going to go ahead and take the first step forward. I am in my last year of high school and I am starting the application process for college this month. I want to dorm (lots of reasons why) but my parents are completely against it because of bad association and everything, so I figured that they would find out soon enough. Financially, I should have everything covered. My teachers and counselor know about my situation and have been giving advice and supporting me, so I think I should be OK for the most part. Anyways, I have so many things I want to say when I tell my parents, but I don't want to get into a war with them about my beliefs if I can avoid it. I was thinking about how I should break the news to them, and I was wondering how /r/exjw did it. So, how did you tell your parents/family that you didn't want to be a JW anymore?
2pjh91	-13834	1418787050	exjw	Update: I finally told my parents I didn't want to be a JW.	[My last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/2otr9q/how_did_you_tell_your_parentsfamily_that_you/)I ended up not telling them that night after all. I tried to, but I started to get physically sick doing it. I had always fantasized about telling them before, but when it came down to it, I just... didn't want to tell them at all. I wrote two pages to them explaining why I didn't want to be a witness, and I left it on their bedside table before I went to school today. It actually went really, really well... I got a text from them during school saying they were happy I let them know how I was feeling, and that they weren't mad at me. However, when I got home, everything felt really... tense. They weren't mad, they weren't sad, and they weren't exactly happy either. They just... didn't know what to say I guess. We sat down together and discussed the letter and what I believed for about an hour. I felt *really* uncomfortable, and I ended up holding back a lot of what I wanted to tell them. Basically... they're going to try and address any "doubts" and "questions" I might have over the next few family studies. What I realized from our discussion is that I don't think they're aware of how far gone I actually am. They want me to present any "research" (AKA Jwfacts /r/exjw) that I've done, and they'll use the Watchtower and Bible to answer my questions. They want to understand *why* I don't believe, but I feel that telling them that I've basically done all my research on apostate websites is out of the cards. I'm at a loss for what to do because I feel like they're either going to shoot down every point that I bring up, or dismiss any good points as "lies" put on the internet by apostates to deceive me. I really don't know what my next step is at this point. 
2qijou	-13834	1419663716	exjw	How to prove them wrong using the Bible?	Quick update: About two weeks ago, [I told my parents that I did not want to be a JW anymore](http://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/2pjh91/update_i_finally_told_my_parents_i_didnt_want_to/) (I'm not baptized). Now, the initial shock has worn off and they talked with me tonight. As I was listening to them talk with me, I came to the realization that they only think I have "doubts" and have been "temporarily led astray by Satan." They really don't know how far gone I actually am. In short, what they told me was "You are wrong, your research is wrong, and we are going to prove you wrong using the Watchtower/Bible." (Ever since I told them what I believed, they  have not cracked open the Bible once, but instead have printed out Watchtower articles to read and force me to watch "Young  People Ask" videos in hopes that my thinking will be changed.) So, now they're going to sit down with me every week to discuss beliefs. They told me that they want to know what I'm truly feeling, but then they get mad and upset that what I truly feel is not what they want to hear. There is no winning. -------------------------------------------------------------------------Anyways, since my research (mainly from jwfacts) is wrong, invalid, and full of apostasy and "lies," I was hoping I could show them faults right from the Bible (Possibly the Watchtower?), but I'm not sure where to begin. I know that Noah's Flood is a goldmine of inconsistencies, but I wanted to know what else I could bring up and how to go about it. Does anyone have any suggestions/ideas? Thank you!

The international convention was being hosted in my hometown, so thousands of JW's were in the area. I tagged along with my parents to our local Walmart, and sure enough, it was packed with JW's doing last minute shopping. Went to go pick up some drinks, found [THIS](http://imgur.com/ReLEtxW) on the shelves. Watchtower and Awake, along with *eleven* handwritten pages of dogma. Showed my parents, who are still firm believers, and they were WTFing as much as I was. They were stuck on whether they should get rid of it or not, so I gladly did it for them. Bonus: Told a hardcore Jdub about it, they said it must have been an apostate that put it there to make the witnesses look bad. lol.[Another picture](http://imgur.com/tlfqaxz)
2s5968	-13834	1421048892	exjw	[Update 2] Talking with my father [Rant and other things]	Back story: Last month I told my parents that I no longer wanted to be a JW. They were in shock for a while, but eventually they sat me down and asked me if it was OK if they sat me down once a week and discussed my beliefs with me. I was opposed to it at first, because I distinctly said in my letter to them that I did not want to go into detail about beliefs/reasons why I left since I knew it would drive us apart and cause arguments (guess what happened?), but they pulled the guilt trip and said it wasn't fair to not give them the chance to "address my doubts." I ended up giving in.Talking once a week turned into twice a week. And then every other day. And now every night. I brought this up to my father (my mother doesn't want to talk with me because she gets emotional about it) and he said "No, I'm not waiting that long anymore. You said that its been two years since you made this personal decision, I want as much time as possible to discuss this with you." Alrighty then. They recently found out that I am now an Atheist and believe in evolution (By the way, I'm still a publisher in the congregation and they're still making me go out in field service even though they know this. My father is an Elder. What the fuck...). Anyways, more shock, more "I can't believe this, I thought we taught you better..." "How can you believe in something like evolution?? That goes against everything we believe! I don't understand!"Ever since then, my father has been printing out and giving me watchtower article after article on evolution/atheism. When I pointed out misquotes in Origin of Life: "So?? You're just looking at this with a critical eye! You need to view this with an open mind and *consider* the information." ....When I pointed out that according to Watchtower's beliefs, they would need to believe in evolution to explain the diversity of animals after Noah's Flood: "Oh! You mean "microevolution.".................When I told him about the United Nations scandal:"Well I don't know about that, I have a lot of faith in the organization and their "no-politics" stance. Besides, it could have been a single bethelite who agreed to align the Watchtower with the United Nations."..................................Tonight, my father pulled me aside and gave me an entire binder of Watchtower dogma that he wants me to look over, including two creation books. He criticized me for making the decision to believe in evolution without reading the creation book first. I gave 17 years to the bOrg. I don't have to read more dogma to come to the conclusion that it is absolute bullshit. On the other side of the coin, I sincerely doubt he has read a single article (not from the bOrg) that explains evolution.  This fucking **IRRITATES** me beyond belief. They think they can give me a few Watchtower articles and they can change my thinking? It has dawned on me that they have *no* intention of understanding what I believe and why I do believe it. They just want to find out what "bothers" me so they can find the right dogma to print out. They criticized me for looking at websites that have biased information against the bOrg, yet they don't think that giving me these articles *from* the bOrg is biased in the slightest?When I try to refute their beliefs with FACTS, I'm "attacking" them and not letting Jehovah into my heart. My relationship with my parents is getting more distant by the day even though we live in the same house.If I knew things would be like this, I would have waited longer to say something. Now I have to endure this for at least another six months, and I just don't know how to handle this...

2xi9a5	-13834	1425165013	exjw	Do they actually know how to have fun?	I went to a ~~party~~ "gathering" recently, and they spent all their time sharing witnessing experiences, playing Bible games, and singing Kingdom songs. Even my best friend (who is still mentally in) said "I already sing with these people at least six times a week, do I really have to do it again..." And its like this every time. If I'm invited over to someones house, its not talk and enjoy each others company, but to watch JW broadcasting and do the Watchtower. I'm traveling to New York with my family in March (first vacation in seven years), and 95% of our time there will be spent at Gilead Grad, touring Walkhill, NJ Assembly Hall, and street witnessing. So many opportunities in NYC, and we're going to be doing the same things we always do.The JW's literally cannot have fun without incorporating worship to Jehovah somehow. It blows my mind.

Taking a family vacation to New York City only to tour bethel, watch Gilead grad, go to the CO visit, and go street witnessing, all while my family knows I don't want to be a witness. Then they ask, "Why do you look so upset?" Hey man, it's not like I wanted to tour the city or anything. I'm sitting in the car right now because "my feet are hurting" while my parents go preach. Fuck me.

Tank, Bruiser, AD, but AP Burst Evelynn is the build I feel most comfortable with especially with the addition of Luden's Echo. I've found this build to be pretty successful, although I've noticed that I tend to fall off around late game during team fights. I start to get focused pretty hard. I'm not sure if I should try and initiate team fights with Evelynn, or stay in the back and try to clean up any that may have tried to run away. I would appreciate it if I could get some advice in regards to itemizing and what I should be doing as Evelynn around mid-late game. Thank you![op.gg](http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Golden+Guns)

Keep in mind that this is unranked, I just hit level 30 and I'm still trying to practice.I was playing my second game as Riven ever, so I was still trying to get used to her. I didn't do well in lane, and the enemy Rengar jungle got fed as hell. I was nearby when our Morgana (who was 2/13 in KDA) was being chased by Rengar (who was 23/5 at this point and full health). I was 5/9 in KDA, but I was full health. Morgana had about 1/4 of her health left, and I decided it wasn't worth it and we would probably end up giving Rengar a double kill. I wasn't confident in my skills with Riven. So after I ran away and Morgana dies, my team completely starts to flame me saying that I'm useless and I should have helped. What should I have done?

Some of the last things they said to me is "Stay loyal as a witness" and "Please, PLEASE don't forget Jehovah."My leaving as a JW is going to break their hearts.Everything sucks right now. 
3h8rqf	-13834	1439762057	exjw	My parents are threatening to kick me out of the house.	I've been mentally out for over two years and my parents have been aware that I don't want to be a witness since December of 2014. I've still been dragged to the meetings, out in field service, and everything else. I recently landed a job and had to turn down a shift just now since my parents refused to take me because they want me at the meetings instead. I am going to be a full time university student with a job starting next week. I am absolutely done going to meetings. It's degrading having to give talks and go out in field service and hand out tracts with my parents knowing that I don't even believe or want to be doing this, and I have been going along with this charade for eight months now. So this sparked an argument that sums up to me being a selfish bitch who disregards the feelings of everyone for my own self interests. And my dad said I should start looking for a new home. I am 17 :-) :-) So I am getting ready for Sunday meeting right now and I'm debating on whether or not I should have myself taken off the school and tell my friends that I'm not going to be a witness. I really don't know what to do right now.

Guns are good but they are loud and ammo is precious.Daryl has a crossbow, which I think is a good start because he can reuse arrows. I think swords would make perfect zombie apocalypse weapons. Specifically swords like katanas and broadswords. You can chop heads, arms and legs easily, and also thrust to the head. Now that the survivors are on a farm I bet they can find something to turn into good melee weapons. A scythe can be turned into a spear which is also good. Aim, thrust to the head, step back and repeat. Of course it's not always as simple as that but you can safely kill several walkers without putting yourself at risk. Still better than those knives in S02E10.P.S. Sorry for my English, not my first language.

[Spoilers]	Hi guys, remember the good old ME2 suicide mission when you had to pick specialists for certain tasks (like a tech expert, team leader and biotic)? Of course you do! That was great, because it affected the outcome. It just came to me that the same could have been made in the Final ME3 mission.You have all those armies at your disposal but they are just numbers. It would have been awesome if you could select types or armies for certain tasks like in ME2 but on a larger scale. For example get the krogan to charge head on, salarians to do covert stuff, or even pair races together to get better results like krogan with asari biotics for support (just an example). If you send salarians head on then they would die you would have greater casualties. If you didn't recruit a faction, then you can substitute it with another instead of krogan send turians. There are just so many possibilities for the final mission, including space combat or decisions that would affect it but we got nothing. Garrus spent ME3 calibrating the gun which was never fired. Shepard got that heating thing for the engines which wasn't even needed.P.S would loved to have seen elcor, hanar and volus take part in the battle :)

1hkjc7	-13842	1372863953	Jazz	Hey /r/Jazz I'm going to meet Robert Glasper Experiment &amp; Medeski, Martin and Wood on the 4th &amp; 5th of July in Riga. Anything you want me to ask them?	Robert Glasper Experiment and Medeski, Martin and Wood (MMW) are coming to Riga today/tomorrow for the Rigas Ritmi Music Festival. I'll be spotlighting their visit (live blog) and I'll have a chance to ask then some questions. I'm taking suggestions as to what I should ask them. I aslo could ask them to do an AMA. Is it something you'd be interested in? Let me know the best way to do that.EDIT: Cool, got everyone's questions (so far) Will try really hard to deliver :) Robert Glasper Experiment has arrived in Riga. Here's the link to the live blog http://gotlatte.com/rigas_ritmi/bde7feEDIT 2: Just met Andreas Varady with his father and brother. They are here for the festival as well. Really cool guys. My collegue will be spotlighting them for 2 days in Riga if you want to see the story it's here http://gotlatte.com/rigas_ritmi/12919a Added more of your questions to my list. It's 00:00 AM now in Riga. In 9 hours I'll be meeting Robert Glasper. Will check this reddit post for more questions in the morning.EDIT 3: The day of following Robert Glasper is over. It was a cool experience. Robert's Q&amp;A was superb, he's a cool guy and the way he answered questions was just mesmerizing. I got a chance to ask him some of your questions so here they are: –Regarding collaboration with Frank Ocean: "Maybe, he’s not on the top of list of people to collaborate with but it could happen." When asked who Robert wants to do a collaboration with Björk and Thom Yorke were the first to be mentioned.–Regarding tours: "I'll be in Rhode Island in August and will start touring the US in September."–Regarding the AMA: "I've heard of reddit and people did mention doing an AMA to me before. We'll see."Sorry for not getting all the answers you were hoping for.Tomorrow I'll be meeting MMW and will report on how that went.EDIT 4: It's been a terrific day. Met John Medeski, Billy Martin and Chris Wood today. Awesome guys and the way they play is just that more amazing. I couldn't believe 1.5 hours went by so quickly. I had a chance to speak to the regarding your questions so here they are:About the records and/or live shows with John Scofield.–Yes, they are planning to do a collaboration with John Scofield next year. They call him uncle John :)About when the album with skerik and Adam Deitch is coming out.–This Fall! About collaboration between MMW and Antibalas–They would love to do it but it's difficult both financially and time (a lot of people in Antibalas). Lastly, I told MMW all about reddit and doing an AMA here. They were pretty excited about it and would love to do one.Hope I delivered some good news today to /r/Jazz. I would also like to share my live blog which a was running to spotlight Medeski Martin and Wood stay here in Riga http://gotlatte.com/rigas_ritmi/d3d128

1n65xy	-13842	1380196420	Blogging	Latte - a new blogging tool for content creation and user engagement [Feedback]	Hi guys, I’d like to tell you and get your feedback on a blogging app &amp; platform we (the team and I) are developing. It’s called Latte for iOS and Android.The idea behind Latte is very simple - making stories from the mobile phone that are seamlessly and automatically uploaded to the web. This way stories become live broadcasts which is perfect for spotlighting events, festivals, trips with friends, news stories, and pretty much everything else. One user even used our app to do the live coverage of Apple September Event 2013. This was a pleasant surprise for us. When we were developing Latte, we went one step further with the live broadcasts by making that people could join each other’s stories and add their own content to them. This added a nice dynamic to making stories. We experienced it first hand when we did our pilot project in July by covering the Tall Ships Races 2013 event our city hosted. The feeling of collaborating in one story and the results we got were very encouraging. But I’ll get to that a bit later.Lastly, we developed an embed feature that enables Latte stories to be added to blogs and websites. We made the embed easily customizable so everyone could match it with their website’s design. Readers can follow the story without leaving the website.**Latte pilot project**In July, Riga hosted the Tall Ships Races 2013 and we thought it would be the perfect event to test drive our app. Feeling very optimistic we contacted our major online news outlet DELFI and pitched our idea that we would run a story from the scene and all they would put up the embed on their page. They agreed and we spent 4 days spotlighting the festivities. The results were better than we and even DELFI had hoped. The story got 20,000 unique visitors that generated 300,000 pageviews and on average spent 7 minutes on site. This showed us that live stories create a whole new level of engagement. Of course we got a lot of traffic from DELFI, but it was the story that made them stay for 7 minutes and look through 15 pages each.Some story examples:[Tall Ships Races 2013] (http://gotlatte.com/liveriga/bb9fa4)[Trip to a medieval festival] (http://gotlatte.com/cheeckyweasel/5be5e5)[Trip to Cologne for the Pirate Summit] (http://gotlatte.com/eegloolab/adb1da)[Apple IPhone Event Sept. 10th 2013] (http://gotlatte.com/bicyclist/066f43)An example of the embed can be found here: [http://eegloo.net] (http://eegloo.net)Download Latte here, it’s free: [http://gotlatte.com] (http://gotlatte.com)**Why am I posting this here?**I love reddit and who better to turn to for honest feedback than the bloggers of reddit. I’m hoping you’ll give Latte a try. I’m eager to hear your thoughts and feedback. I think it could be a great tool to bloggers in creating new content and engaging their audience.

Hi guys,Thought I'd share the 2 roses I made for gifts from scrap.Roses album - [http://imgur.com/a/JZiwy](http://imgur.com/a/JZiwy)Additional photos from the creation process [http://imgur.com/a/mow5j](http://imgur.com/a/mow5j)I found that such roses make for good gifts (or for selling). They are quite small, these are about 40 centimeters in length and require little material and, at the same time, make for good practice for a beginner like myself. There's also lots of room for experimentation.The first rose I wire brushed, then used rough sandpaper to add some contrast to the texture, and covered with transparent metal lacquer. With the second one I did the same but also added temper coloring to the rosebud using a propane blow torch. I think it looks nice. The colors do become less vibrant when you cover them with transparent metal lacquer (on the photos the colors are without lacquer), but they are still visible and look very nice.Beginner's tip: If you're planning on making such roses, (especially from scrap) I do recommend leaving one leaf and one piece of the rosebud so you can use them to outline future leaves and rosebuds. It can be paper or flat metal pieces. Makes it easier to find suitable bits and pieces when digging through offcuts.I'm told that hemp oil can be used to make temper colors - will see how it goes. I want to explore using temper colors further. If you have any pointers, please share.If you have any questions on the creation process or need specs, let me know.

a929s	-13843	1259452625	tipofmytongue	Anime Series from my childhood	Well guys, I figured that someone on here might be able to help me. I used to live in India, where TV wasn't really common when I was growing up (much less anime). Anyway, there were two anime series I used to watch, one of them I eventually figured out to be "Flame of Recca" (awesome series by the way). The other one is something I cannot remember the name of at all. I moved away a while back and want to finish watching the second series for emotional/nostalgic reasons.It involved a martial arts-ey sort of thing. It was about a group of people, perhaps 4-5 (I think friends). One memorable scene is when the group gets surrounded (they get circled in) by "bad guys" and one of the members of the group (who looks like a kid) basically acts like he is urinating and goes around to each of the bad guys and then urinates on them. I think the next thing they do is jump high and run away since the urine was actually some sort of glue that sticks their feet to the ground so that they cannot run after them.Come on reddit, help me out with this one. This has been bothering me since about 7 years ago, when I ended up finding the rest of "Flame of Recca".Note: This is a reposting from /r/self based on a suggestion.**EDIT:**eevilkat is my hero.You are an awesome individual who just made my day :) and reddit, you made my year :)

If you want your UDID approved, PM me and I'll add it to my approved devices list. The rest is up to you. I'm doing this for **free**.If I don't respond quickly enough about adding you to my list, it's probably due to me studying for my finals. Don't worry, as long as you meet the requirements and I have space, I'll add you.*As all offers must have a clause, here is mine: I'll only add you if you've been a redditor for &gt;1 month. Exceptions will be made based upon my discretion.******EDIT: Just as a note, if you are participating in app testing with another developer, you don't need to be put on a list. Your device is are already approved for the beta. Just find it and install it. Bear this in mind before messaging me, that way more people can have the opportunity.*****EDIT2: Wow, this is an overwhelming response. Please bear with me while I slowly add you people. It seems like people really want to donate -_-. **I really don't want to do this for the money, think of it as a present to the community on my reddit birthday**. The entire purpose of this was so that people don't get scammed by someone. If you want to give me money though, I'm not going to say no, so if you desperately want to, then message me.Also, the developer site is down for updating at the moment, so it looks like a new beta is going to be out soon. *****EDIT 3: False alarm, just iTunes windows drivers for 4.0.*****EDIT 4: Just as a warning, make sure to keep your phone updated with the latest betas when they get released. Otherwise you'll find yourself locked out of your phone.

Just like with the 3.0 beta, it appears as though they are sticking to a ~2 week release cycle. So I suggest keeping an eye out for that.*****I have not upgraded yet and I'm going to try to wait it out, but from what I gather, the issue with photos might be due to the fact that the camera roll folder is not named appropriately. Perhaps use iPhoneBrowser or a Mac equivalent (I like PhoneView) and see if renaming it back to **100APPLE** instead of **8888PPLE** will fix it.I'd really appreciate it if someone reports back about my proposed fix...

So I was wondering if you guys knew anyone who defends dog owners or any lawyer who is competent and does pro bono work.She's already contacted a lot of people, and most of them seem to be ones that fight dog owners than defend them. She did manage to get a hold of someone who could help her, but her asking rate is $250/hr and like I said, someone on a student's budget cannot afford that.I figured I'd ask you guys since we are a diverse crowd and someone must know something. Any help would go a long way. Thanks in advance guys.

We see a chick in a thong in the snow, pants hanging around her ankles, sitting on the sidewalk. All the while that one guy is yanking on her arm and the other has a camera and appears to be taking photos. This is happening as a semi-truck is stretched across the street, blocking traffic and the driver seemed to be just chilling and watching this proceed.I got my friend to call the cops immediately as the girl seemed like she was trying to push these guys away... Turns out the police have already been called and someone was already on their way...Just thought I'd share my random story of the day.Also, wow, Surrey has a crap-load of snow. There was barely any snow when I got into Burnaby/Coquitlam.

I don't know how long S42 is but I don't fancy playing it all in a single day just to reach the PU, not to mention if this campaign will be fail-able but optimised to cater to players of all skill levels - meaning it will either be adaptive - hardly fair if you get lucky, or fixed difficulty - allowing skills players to get through faster.I would love to be able to switch between PU and S42 so that I can enjoy the latter over a few days or a week.I hope S42 is released at least a week before the post beta PU goes lives.Also, if S42 contains data linked to your character migrating into the PU I guess that means it will require internet only to ensure that people do not cheat when bringing chars into the PU?EDIT:Replies have indicated that S42 will be fully released prior to the PU giving players time to finish it at their leisure.
2brvi0	-13846	1406376180	Starcitizen_trades	[Discussion] Interest in LTI Linked to skill	Hi there, I have 4 LTI ships and I sold my LTI Retaliator to a WTB Thread a few months ago, $365 after fees.There are lots of threads about LTI, reasons for/against, rather than jump in someone else's I wonder if anyone considered LTI to be **linked to self-perception of personal skill?**In elaboration: It's been established that some people think LTI is worthless - Its easy to think those are the people who don't have it, but with CCUs coming up, and Auroras giving the opportunity for (2nd hand) LTI for under $150 anyone can have it for the same rate.I was a kickstarter backer, since then I have two 2 man ships and a 5 man ship. I also did my good will by converting $800 of ships to LTI for 5 people.Do you guys think that demand for it is linked to skill, time and real-word financial circumstances rather than prestige and collect-ability? That is the worse someone thinks they will be the game the more they place value on a ship that never dies? Of course CIG claim hull insurance will be so cheap anyone can pay for it with $.What makes this thread any different to the others? Nothing really, but **I would like to hear why you have a* second hand LTI ship?** Does it give you the confidence in playing the game. I have my LTI hornet because I doubt my own skill, the other ships are to support the game development.*or more than 1 LTI ship.EDIT1: Bolded for clarity.

2e2pjz	-13846	1408536912	Starcitizen_trades	Why do people pay paypal fees if buyer protection does not apply?	From paypal:&gt;Claims can only be made for physical goods that can be posted and are not prohibitedI have a pending sale, and while I would never lie or take advantage of another user or ask them to go into a compromising position, I can see no good reason for me to have to pay fees, for them to gain nothing.  On the transaction I am currently working out the fees are 7.55 international, if there is no buyer protection, can I not list a lower price and have the buyer send less money?Note, I realise that until the seller sends the ship both parties have no proof that an item was or was not sent, thus why the paypal and recipient RSI email ought to be the same and the paper trail to that point should reflect that.EDIT:I'm not saying I will do this, but I cannot see a good reason not to. Any replies will be useful to myself and my buyer. EDIT2(conclusion):If both parties are in the EU fees may be pointless, as my buyer is in the US, I will pay fees on his transaction without objection.

So, I see a fair number of Phoenixes (upgrades) trading on this forum since the sale ended, I don't know if CIG has stopped giving refunds or what because given they sold out it seems odd that so many are available.It seems to me the list prices are varying at around 40 to 60% above cost, but are they actually selling?EDIT1: Or did people buy them purely to sell for a profit ~~and thus depriving people who really wanted the item~~ from getting it from CIG (~~it did sell out after all~~).Disclaimer - I bought one, and I might sell it, but certainly not in 2014.EDIT2:

I weighed up long and hard the decision to not buy some of these just to sell, so don't accuse me of jealousy, I could have bought five or more and making at least 20% that easily is an incredible but disgusting opportunity, on the last two days I strongly considered going against the tide of immorality* and buying a pair to sell for $700** down the road after the prices hike. *Not profit, the fact that the product is limited in number and thus every item bought to resell could have been purchased by someone who did not buy with that intent.**Round figure, I'd like to be compensated for my time, but if I charged $40 for my altruist conduct,  i'd need a further $40 in fees on paypal (currency conversion).I don't think such a Moratorium is **beyond** discussion. EDIT1: Should have been "peoples' perceptions" or "peoples perceptions' " :p**EDIT2: To clarify this speculation is targeted at people who knew they would sell it on purchase*** and people who have suddenly decided to do so for more than $700.01 within 60 days of purchase. Stores/WTB excluded (for perception reasons)*****And have deprived real buyers of an opportunity for the full goods (treating "being giftable" as an attribute people would be entitled to)EDIT3: I am surprised by the downvotes (not that I care in the slightest but it is indicative of opinion even if people who reply are not the ones doing it) :P EDIT4: Seems most of the downvoting is not for what I said, but simply what I wish to precipitate discussion on.

33l5lf	-13846	1429792133	starcitizen	Would you run escort in exchange for a cargo allotment in excess of your best [single seater] ship?	For the sake of argument 50 to 100FU.Just wondering the general opinion on running escort roles in **exchange** for cargo space rather than payment?Main advantage - if you're destroyed but the ship you're protecting makes it your cargo survives and you get paid (goods returned).This is the role I plan to play in the PU - helping starter ship players to make freight runs if they desire it. And of course openning up the option of their running 'medium volume medium value' cargos instead of the higher risk 'low volume high value [or if unaffordable low volume med/low value]'.This 'model' is very close to the kind of incentive one might expect for crewing a freighter.EDIT (speculative):I hope in the PU that the cargo the frieghter is transporting is still recognised within the 'system' as the property of the owner who deposited it in the ship and is flying in one of the escort roles. Hopefully CIG will allow a player to have cargo insurance on 'crates' not held within a ship the owner is flying on.EDIT2:Think of it as a symbiosis for fledgling haulers. There is no exchange of payment from any of the parties.EDIT3:An alternative to paying escorts flat fees or a percent of profits. Though NOT the same as asking escorts to buy 'shares' in an operation. A 'model' such as this would only be of use to players who actually wanted **actual** goods transported, but personally lacked capacity.EDIT4:Shame I didn't start this tomorrow - I have been thinking of the starfarer, Taurus and caterpillar, when the Hull reveal is tomorrow :) Still, this is one way to fill your Hull.EDIT5:To the naysayers, you're mostly referring to situations in which money changes hands, that does not happen here. I don't consider them comparable.

1tuqjg	-13878	1388201671	doctorwho	My theory on the swift regeneration of Matt Smith to Peter Capaldi. (Kinda Spoilers)	A lot of people are complaining about how quickly Matt regenerated and it made me think there must be a reason for it. I watched a few videos of previous regenerations and noticed that they seem to become more and more volatile as the show progresses. My theory is that with each regeneration in each cycle a time lords body becomes less in tune with the regeneration process, meaning that it requires more power and regeneration energy to actually regenerate. Matt Smith's first regeneration in the episode occurs after he receives another Regeneration cycle from Galliefrey, the resulting regeneration was powerful enough to wipe out the entire Dalek fleet, but it only succeeded in making his body young again.I think that was his body burning off the rest of his previous cycle so it could assimilate with the new one, and given that it was a new cycle it was much more focused, which is what I believe caused the *Snap* regeneration.

My morning train had technical trouble so I had to get off and on a different more crowded train (all while shlepping a serious amount of belongings). Followed by my connecting train closing it's doors literally in my face (I was about to step on). The library had checked out all the books I needed for a research paper. The meeting I set with a professor was late because a previous student was late to his meeting, making me late for my class (I like to be punctual). Now this class was a four hour waste of my life, almost nothing constructive came out of it because my professor did it "on the fly" (who doesn't make a plan for class?). So all the things I shlepped to school had no use and I did it for nothing.Now I was feeling a little gurglpurtz about the whole day, but things were gunna be fine until the lady on the train embarrassed the butt off me when she didn't believe I had a monthly pass because it didn't look like I could afford one. And now I'm just crying on the train even though I know in the grand scheme of things today wasn't a bad day.I just wanted to write that out. Hope everyone else had a good day full of positive energy!
2okx0n	-13881	1417985932	sex	An odd problem (f20)	I am in a long distance relationship, we live on opposite sides of the country, and other than the distance, everything is just wonderful.Now I have no problem with him watching porn and jerking it, and he has no problem with doing the same. We have sexy skyping times, and sext frequently, so I feel very intimate with him.The problem is, when I go to masturbate without porn I get to the point where all of a sudden this horny need to touch myself now is replaced with this empty, lonely sensation and I just start to cry because I miss him so much.I'm just a little frustrated because I don't know what to do.

2u2sw2	-13881	1422537501	self	Just a Sam having trouble with her Frodo	So I haves this friend, and for the sake of privacy I decided to change all the names, Frodo. We've been friends for a while, and she had an audition coming up in Bree, and asked me to accompany her on this little adventure. As only a good friend I say, of course! I support you! Let's rock this.So we go, have a total blast, and on our way back to the Shire I guess I said something stupid. I told my dear Frodo, that she had the power to change how she was feeling about this guy, who is basically Sarumon.She told me she didn't want a pep talk, and I said oh I am sorry. Conversation then ceased and she moved a seat ahead of me in the carriage. I wait about ten minutes and apologize, I didn't want to ruffle her feathers, and after a long, unexpected journey, I was mentally wiped. Frodo stated she was still annoyed and she had to listen to me talk about woes of love. The silence continued.My Gandalf picks us up and drives her to Bag End, where I get out to help with he luggage and apologize once more, and say let's hug! She stares at me and asks why. I hate to end things on a sour note, and especially with the weather, no one should leave feeling angry at someone you love. Frodo states she is still annoyed, scoffs, and leaves after a no hearted, half hug.I return home. Water my plants. Get a good night's rest. The next day I sent her a little stay safe text, and nothing from Mr. Frodo.It's been a couple of days and I haven't heard from Frodo. I feel real horrible that I said those things and upset her so. Now I don't know if I should finish making Mr. Frodo this shawl! I just wished to remove that from my chest! I hope you have a good day, and if not, my positive energy is in your direction! :)Tl;Dr went on adventure with Frodo; tried to be positive and supportive; backfire; mass apologies; I am the Sam in the third movie when Frodo tells Sam to leave; stuck with decision to finish her present. Also have a good day! :)

34uo75	-13881	1430764439	self	Dropping Out	I told myself after two years of college I would reflect upon whether I needed to finish my degree, or if I had a solid foundation to learn on my own.I'm in art school, and right now I'm living at home, commuting in, and taking on no debt. I've been given this wonderful opportunity of education, and appreciate it immensely but, I don't think college is for me.I've dropped out once before, and made a change to switch schools and it turned out for the better. I just have this feeling in my gut that I need to be doing something different. That I'm waiting around for this degree, only for the sake of having a piece of paper. I want to be doing more, I need change, something different.I feel like I have the foundation which I could build upon myself. I've got great time management skills and I'm incredibly financially repsonsoble. I have a plan and a curriculum put together so I can continue to build my skills outside of the classroom.And now I have this life changing decision to make. Do I suffer through another two and a half years of school to just get a degree? Or do I drop out and make my own way?I just wanted to write all this out and reflect a little bit. Thank you for listening. Hope you have a wonderful day!

I came to terms with that, when I found out all the lying and sneaking around you were doing. Losing my only best friend was fine, I got over it. I tried to at least. We graduated, you left without saying a word. I went to college, sort of forgot how much it stung. Until I saw you came and visited and saw every single person but me.We were best friends. And you didn't even give me a heads up you were coming to town. It stings. I don't want to admit it, but it hurts. My feelings are hurt and there's nothing I can really do but write it out and post it somewhere just to tell someone that I want to hate you. I want to drop it and never think about you again.But you were important to me, and I can't forget that. I'm so glad you are living a wonderful life. I just miss having you as a best friend and I'm a little sour about it.Love,Me.

2pd7a2	-13892	1418658033	Firefighting	What is your department's policy on out of town training?	In our rural, volunteer department, any active firefighter is allowed to attend any in state fire training seminar they want.  Our training fees, mileage to and from the training, meals ($35 for the day, no alcohol), and hotel room ($100 per night) are all paid for by the department.  This includes any classes we'd like to take at the National Fire Academy.  While not very many of us take the department up on this offer, personally, I'm a huge proponent of the policy.  It allows us to go and train on topics individually that there may not be enough interest to bring the course back to train the entire department.  Our training is entirely run by our local community college, and they require a minimum of 12 firefighters present in each class.  I attend 3 or 4 of these weekend seminars on a yearly basis, and have been bringing back ideas to our department that has resulted in changes and improvements to our policies and tactics.  In talking with other firefighters at the seminars, some departments pay for their members to go, whereas others pay for it out of pocket.At our last board meeting, one of our old board members (current FF with 40+ years of service) questioned the amount of $$ budgeted for training and started slamming the out of town training stating it wasn't worth the cost.  After a long discussion, the board thankfully decided to keep the policy as is for next years budget.How does your department handle out of town training?  What do you like or dislike about your policy?

Anyway, every 7870 XT I've seen has 1536 stream processors, but this one only has 1280. In addition, as it is claiming to be OC'ed I'm thinking it has been OC'ed to 925mhz core and 6000mhz memory to make it look like a tahiti card when in fact it isn't.Any help would be appreciated, thanks.

1j97r9	-13901	1375070170	Health	What are my chances of food poisoning	Hi, its the first time I've attempted to cook myself something in the oven. I had garlic + herb chicken and oven chips. The packet recommended 15-20 minutes gas mark 7 for the chips, and 15-20 minutes gas mark 6 for the chickenI put the chips in on gas mark 6 for 25 minutes and the chicken on gas mark 6 for 20 minutes. The chips were burned on the edges leading me to think the oven was hot enough. Because of the garlic and herb stuff on the chicken I couldn't really see the fluids from it. The inside seemed pretty white though. I was quite nervous at the time and worried so by the time I had started to eat the food it had already cooled down a lot. To put my mind and ease.. or make me worry, I seek opinion on my chances and whether I will be ok. I ate the food around 7 hours ago and I am feeling as I normally would. I am a bit of a hypochondriac though and really make myself worry, all advice is greatly appreciated (and I am home alone all week which is why I am asking here and not my parents)Thanks

It can become a bit of a chore to use and leaves me feeling there is more to be desired. I decided to make this post to try and get these changes implemented or at least thought about as I believe it can help improve the game.1) Rearranging items - I think we should be able to drag and drop items, it sure is a hassle inserting something at the beginning of your item build. 2) Multiple potions - Some gods I just can't cope with 1 potion to start with, for example I need 3 health potions with Sun Wukong just to sustain the early levels.3) Purchasing different stages of items - It would be nice to be able to purchase items and actives in their first stages and select the when you wish to upgrade them. For example, I would like my Teleport to Towers to upgrade from tier 2 to tier 3 at level 15.Feel free to discuss and suggest your own improvements below and if you wan't I'll add them to the post.

1suipv	-13901	1386995366	Smite	Discussion: Will Kali get nerfed/buffed?	I've been thinking about the gold skin and I really don't want to waste 15k favor for her to get nerfed. Personally I feel she is in a good place, not OP and not too weak. She can snowball and fall behind quite easily though which is why I'm worried they might nerf her in some way.Discuss away!

1uqvr1	-13901	1389219911	Smite	Suspended mid-match	So its probably been a long time coming, I get way too angry at noobs and trolls. You could make it so it does it after the match so it doesn't screw my team and friends over... also, someone link me to the Hi-Rez support thing so I can try to find out what I said that caused it. Finally, is there a way to find out if anyone I have reported has been banned? I'll be pretty pissed if I've got banned for BM when there are people who are actually racist in games. TYEDIT: I believe it also my first ban yet I have a week ban and my friend says it should be 3 days, any knowledge on this? ty.EDIT 2: Its also a Match Griefing suspension and I have a total of 3 leaves if this helps with narrowing it down ty.FINAL EDIT: So I was told to check my emails and sure enough it is there. It's my first ban and for personal attacks or insults to sexual orientation apparently, I'm assuming its the former because I make sure to avoid sexual/racist remarks. In addition is it my only warning and the next time will be a permanent ban it says. Thank you to the one helpful response I got.

Putting it simply, more servers and better matchmaking will come along with growth of the game. Making posts about it changes nothing, so stop. Thank you.

All the other game modes are boring to us and we have to wait until we get another player or one of us leaves.I know HiRez don't want 4 person parties because you can force a surrender and the 5th person can be bullied, but honestly I wouldn't mind being the 1 person paired up with a 4 man. Their improved communication should allow for a better experience for me as the team as a whole should have decent teamwork.Please can we re-consider this being an option?

1y42jn	-13901	1392605851	AskDocs	Sudden loss of hearing.	Hi. About a week ago now I woke up and couldn't hear properly in my left ear, it is about 20% of the volume of my right ear. I've had it before about 3 times but it only lasted a few hours each time, and rubbing my ear seemed to clear it.This time it has stayed. It went away for a while about 5 days ago but came back a few hours later.The only thing I have tried is clearing out the wax in my ear with salt water by letting is soak in and tilting my head to let it drip out.I have a busy timetable and I am going to try and get to the doctors ASAP bit any help is appreciated, thank you.Edit: a few more details: when I first got it there was huge pressure in the left side of my head, that seems to be gone now. I am either used to it or it has reduced a fair amount.Secondly: I have slight ringing in both my ears when it is quiet for as long as I can remember, but now when it is quiet the ringing is very loud in my left ear and intensifies as I focus on the ringing.

Should help higher ping players be able to place Noxious Fumes down in time after using Rain Fire.I'm guessing you didn't even change this like you said you have. The stun is still as hard to hit as before today's patch. The maths works out that it should be exactly the same difficulty to land a stun now as it was before you changed any of the timings. After first change: +0.3s casting on fumes, -0.1s recovery = 0.2s smaller time frame.After second change: -0.2s recovery, = 0.2s larger time frame.NET CHANGE: 0It definitely isn't as easy to hit as before these two changes, even though the math says it should be. Check the numbers in your code please.
1ykvne	-13901	1393025758	Smite	I know partially what causes the rubber banding in matches	When you get those matches when you can't do anything and everything is delayed by 5 seconds for everybody, it only happens when somebody leaves and rejoins. I've seen this one specific player do it 4 times now and I believe it is intentional, or at the very least something he can't control. Does any hirez employee want to take this name and look at analyze his account? Maybe you can see what is happening when he reconnects that causes it.And a proposed fix: A match restart option.Simple option really, type /voterestart in chat or a similar command, and it takes 6-8 players out of 10 to be successful. It kicks everybody and restarts the game at the same time/gold etc but every1 is back at spawn. I can't take these crap games anymore nobody wants to surrender and it is a waste of my time. 45 min game in ranked for a loss.

1zg0qd	-13901	1393865486	Smite	Some Scylla facts from analyzing the video.	So I looked at the video and tried to work out some important parts of her kit.* Her skill cooldowns are 10/10/15/90.* Maxing a skill gives +20 magical power, hence +80 at level 20. Some things in the video don't seem to add up, it is possible that it is a visual bug in the video or she gains +85 power at level 20 instead of +80.* Scylla's 3rd ability, Sentinel, lasts 5 seconds in the video. * Scylla's 3rd ability, Sentinel, scales in size as she levels it up allowing for greater ward coverage. * The delay on her ultimate between firing and it actually hitting is approximately 1 second. Comment if I've done something wrong or you find anything.

211ajk	-13901	1395442872	Smite	Proof matchmaking isn't matching close ELOs	If you queue towards the end of the timer you are less likely to get placed. Why is this? No matter when you queue the chance of being placed should be the same because it should fit you in with your closest matches and move one of those 10 to another group. Seems to me like it just leaves the 10 people as 9 x 2000 and 1 x 1500 rather than removing the 1500 and putting me (2000) in.Another example that just happened: Im queuing with 2 friends at ~2400 elo. I'm between them both on elo. They queue a few seconds before me, around 20s left and get placed but I don't? They should remove the lowest elo out of their game and put me in seeing as lowest elo will be around 2000.

21myxi	-13901	1396053353	techsupport	Blue screening and drop in fps	Hi, a few days ago my PC crashed and made a loud buzzing noise with a bluescreen. It has done it 3 times since then but windows was "collecting data before restarting" making me think it didn't crash as hard. The error message mentioned something about drivers being equal or below on this screen. I've had my pc for like 6months+ and never had this problem, also I haven't upgraded my drivers unless its done it automatically. I'm wondering what the problem could be? I have been noticing FPS drops as well so I'm thinking it could be my graphics card but I don't see why that would cause my PC to crash repeatedly.
21n314	-13901	1396056544	Smite	A question about V-Sync.	So I've played since I got my new PC like 6 months ago, always capped FPS on high settings with no AA.When AA and maximum settings were introduced I could run on maximum but AA made me lag, now thanks to optimisation it seems fine but I have a very important question. Does V-Sync increase the load on my PC, even if the FPS drops?Example I get 100fps, V-Sync drops it to 60, but does my PC load increase or decrease?I'm asking cos I've been bluescreening lately and I'm not sure why, it feels like I must be overheating or something but my temps are maxing at 80degrees c. I'm looking for ways to reduce the load on my pc. Thanks.EDIT: Just to clarify its the GPU that is reaching ~80degrees C and making me try to reduce my load.
22nsr4	-13901	1397095730	Smite	Ranked RAGE Post!	OBLIGATORY RANKED RAGE POSTOk I am 3000 elo and being placed with 1000 elo. What. The. Hell.Yes its been like this for ages, but I suggest a league-barrier to prevent unbalanced games like this. So here's how it would work. You are only allowed to be placed with people within 1 league of your league.Example 1: Bronze league? Only allowed to be placed with bronze and silver.Example 2: Silver league? Only allowed to be placed with bronze/silver/gold. Example 3: Gold league? Only allowed to be placed with silver/gold/platinum. Ok you get it. I think I speak for all decent ranked players that we do not want to have unbalanced games as it is one of the reasons for the BM and frustration in this game.

Something amazingly generous happened today and I felt the need to share it and show how awesome the smite community really is. So today was my birthday, I am ill with an ear infection, and my coursework was due at midnight. I tuned into suntouch's stream (my regular) while taking a short break from my work. I tell them of my situation and wzkid buys me a present for my birthday. 2500 gems! Thats $35! That is a huge amount of money to spend on somebody you don't know and I can't thank him enough for his generosity. It really made my day more than anything else receiving such an amazing gift from somebody who doesn't even know me in real life. Again, thank you so much wzkid for the amazing gift, suntouch for doing entertaining and regular streams, and the rest of suntouch's twitch channel viewers for giving it such an amazing atmosphere every day. I love you all &lt;3
25zpwn	-13901	1400548690	Smite	Did Hirez change the elo calculation?	Last night I was 2500 elo. Now I am 2100. It is has literally disappeared overnight. I am the 4th highest in ranked leaderboards. How did this happen?EDIT: I also found a way to prove it if this is not solved. Earlier today I played a ranked game on the same team as suntouch. I was top ELO and you can watch his VODs and find this out. Second elo was Applepiegod with 2400. Now I am 2100 and he is still 2400. Its impossible to lose 400 in only around 6 hours when I played no games. Additionally, I just spoke to youngbae in my game who also lost 500 elo during the server issues. Can we get this fixed please.2nd EDIT: This needs to be fixed soon, otherwise when I get promoted I will only gain 1 league instead of two, and my tribute point gains will be bad. Fix asap please!3rd EDIT: FFS. I only got promoted 1 league instead of 2 because hirez screwed my elo over, I am so mad right now. 
262836	-13901	1400618558	Smite	HiRez doesn't acknowledge important problems	Hirez doesn't seem to acknowledge any of the problems in smite, just some days they will change things out of the blue. Problems which they don't fix remain in the dark because they don't give us reasons why they can't be fixed or why they aren't being fixed.For example, the recent EU server outage caused a bug which cost me to lose 400 elo randomly. This has happened to some other big players in league such as youngbae. Now this loss of elo has already cost me 1 league. I was promoted and only gained 1 league instead of 2 because my elo is so low. Why is this problem not being addressed? I have made 2 posts specifically about it, and tweeted 2 HiRez employees, but no response. I would at least like a response saying if they know about the players affected by a drop in elo, and whether or not it would be possible to fix. I feel like HiRez is good at keeping the community updated for future updates and are a very cool company but when it comes to the problems I always feel like the players are excluded from knowing anything about. Another example is the league badges for "season 1", how we were given badges from season 7 rather than the start of season 8 which is what we had actually earned. I would like them to explain why we have to use season 7 and not season 8 which would account for the latest promotions. It is really frustrating to not get explanations for stuff like this.This is the end of my opinionated rant or whatever you want to call it, I really hope HiRez will start to address the issues and problems of the game and not just ignore them or fix them when they feel like it.

270tz1	-13901	1401620757	Smite	Kali QoL suggestion	Ok so I didn't think this was going to be allowed until Osiris was released so I never bothered suggesting it. But here goes:Can Kali have her attack progression changed to 0.5/0.5/1x?  Every time I play her and I start auto attacking, it just feels like a 0.5/0.5/1x after the first few chains. To me it just makes sense to have the bigger auto attack as the final one, I'm not sure if anybody else agrees. IMO this would make her feel more smooth and make more sense and perhaps get more people to play her.

29riom	-13901	1404414559	Smite	In game problem that affects the SWC - fix asap	You can't surrender in custom matches instantly anymore, you have to wait the full ten minutes. So when there are technical difficulties and a remake is needed they will need to wait 11:30 to surrender which will make the SWC slower and have huge wait times between matches.At least that's how it has been in the scrims we've played, so it will probably be a problem this weekend too.The reason I'm posting it here and not smite bug is because it should receive urgent attention, although its probably too late.

2ashcm	-13901	1405453348	Smite	Do we need another optimization patch?	I'm not usually one to complain but in the past I used to get 150fps and then it gradually reduced as they updated smite, then they did an optimization patch and everything was great again. Now I'm at about 90fps instead of 150fps so I am wondering if anyone else is having similar issues and whether or not we should ask for another optimization patch in the near future.EDIT: Alot of people are upvoting and commenting which is great, but can you also comment how your FPS has changed over the past month? Like mine is really bad now and I want to know if theres a problem with my PC or whether its just smite. Thanks!EDIT2: I'm still testing stuff. It appears the main problem for me is world detail. I've decided to put everything else on maximum and world detail on low as its a big drop in performance for me. You lose the grass and flowers and some objects outside the map from what I can tell, but the textures are still great on the walls/rocks/environment so the game is still beautiful. It will have to do for now!EDIT 3: 100 Net upvotes in 6 hours! So there is a clear evidence of people wanting an optimization patch, which may or may not be possible as the game is growing in content and could already be well optimized. Some words from HiRez letting us know if this would be possible would be great as many of us have bad performance lately.EDIT 4: Still messing with it.. today I turned on anti aliasing to high instead of off and my FPS actually increased back to 150fps, very weird.
2asx78	-13901	1405462021	techsupport	Random drops in GPU load	So I built this pc almost a year ago and it worked (as far as I could tell) fine. I would play a game that capped at 150fps and it would be at it constantly. Today I messed around in the bios and had a big problem, so I cleared my CMOS by removing the battery on the mobo. To get to the battery I had to remove the graphics card. Now I've plugged it back in and restarted my PC, I'm getting FPS drops on the game I was previously getting 150fps. I used GPU-z to look at my load for my graphics card and it would seem to drop out randomly for a few seconds causing FPS drops. I also ran the passmark 8 test and was getting results like thishttp://i.imgur.com/Iqu9XOk.pngThis test compared my PC performance to other PC's with the same graphics card. Sometimes my performance would be as good as the other PC's but in this particular case and on 3 of the 2D tests my performance would be significantly worse, usually half or even worse than half. What could be causing my drops in gpu load after the events I did in the past day, does anybody have an idea?edit: After running the test a few times my graphics card is really struggling on directx 9 complex every single time so its almost as if my GPU load isn't dropping, its just bad on these particular tests that it is struggling on, but the other cards its comparing with are fine.

2bweab	-13901	1406506365	Smite	Does smite use Direct3D?	I ask because before there was a tickbox in the settings so you know whether you were using it or not.But now, there isn't one, and I've been hit extremely hard performance wise and I want to know why. I seem to have some weird sort of problem with Direct3D/DirectX 9 and I have no clue why, but any game using that just lags like hell, which makes me suspect smite has done something with it.Before I was hitting 150fps all the time, now im bouncing between 60-100. If anybody knows or knows how to find out what my PC is running smite on, pls respond. EDIT: In the BattleSystemSettings config file am I allowed to change those values to whatever I want, e.g. enable D3d11 and prefer d3d11? or will the hirez anti-cheat thingy go whack?

A MOBA I play called smite though uses Dx9 and I can't force it to use anything else, and directx9 games on my PC are very laggy for some reason. I even downloaded a benchmark tester and some of the directx9 tests had insanely low fps (especially in fullscreen) about 4x worse fps than the same loop in dx10 or above.I really need help with this its driving me insane :(
2cgde4	-13901	1407016530	Smite	Fixed my FPS issues by using DX11	I've been having insanely volatile FPS lately and it was really getting on my nerves to the point I stopped playing the game, but I finally improved my FPS using DX11.Open the launcher and go into the options (the 2 cogs button). Then there's a box for optional game command line parameters. In the box type:"-dx11" without the quotation marks. This makes the game run in DX11 instead of DX9. A few notes:  -Won't work if your GPU doesn't support DX11  -Could cause worse performance in older PCs  And a last tip:Decreasing world detail from high to medium gave me a 30% increase in FPS. All of the other options could be low or maximum and the fps wouldn't vary much, so world detail is the most important one to lower.

2hc6kc	-13901	1411573004	dating_advice	New to dating, need help on timing?	Hi I recently had my first spell of dating a girl I liked. Things ended up being too soon for her since her ex so we aren't dating anymore but I really enjoyed the experience and want to pursue dating some more, but I have some questions about any future dates I go on.Firstly I want to ask about duration of dates. How long is a good duration for a date to last? Most of my dates lasted around 5 hours which in retrospect seemed a little bit long to me, a good portion of that time would be just sitting in the car talking after our date activity and I'm starting to wonder if spending too long together could have contributed to us not working out.Secondly, talking outside of dates e.g texting/facebook. For the duration of us dating it was the holidays so we'd speak every day for most of the day, usually ending up with about 10 hours total of messages to each other about movies, tv shows, and just other random stuff. Again I feel like this was too much, by the time our actual dates come around we'd have less and less interesting stuff to talk about and the dates became less enjoyable. So how long should I be aiming to message for and how many days of the week? And finally, how long should the dating period last before you become girlfriend and boyfriend? This was probably one of the contributing factors to why our relationship didn't work out. We had spoke about this and agreed a date on which we would call ourselves an official couple just to save the awkwardness of asking the question. Shortly before that date arrived she said it was too soon since her ex and broke things off. So assuming things are going well in a relationship how do you decide when to ask about becoming official? Is there a good guideline of weeks/months/number of dates or any other factor to wait before asking about becoming official?I appreciate any advice on any of the 3 questions I have or any other advice related to them in general, thank you!

2k0cdg	-13901	1413997818	Smite	I think HiRez did the right thing.	The bigger smite grows the more important it will be to maintain the integrity of the eSports scene. In other games such as CS:GO there are betting sites for real money, and eventually I see something similar becoming available for Smite. It's important to stamp out collusion and cheating in the early stages to discourage it from happening in the future on a bigger and more valuable scale, with players' winnings and potentially viewers' bets being on the line.  Good job HiRez.

2s22nm	-13901	1420981853	GlobalOffensive	How does the zoom sens work?	I am much more comfortable with rifling on a higher sens, but my awping struggles. I used to be much better with the awp when I was on 2 sens at 400 DPI and 1 zoom sens. Now I'm at 2.5 sens at 400DPI. Would zoom sens of 0.8 effectively give me 2 sens when I'm awping (on both levels of zoom) or does it work differently? Thanks :D
2sakyy	-13901	1421166516	GlobalOffensiveTrade	[Q] Acquiring keys in the UK?	In the near future I'm looking to buy a cheap knife or something because I spend a lot of time on this game and want to treat myself. Buying it off the market I lose some money and would have to sell for keys if I ever wanted my money back anyway.  So whats the best method for me to acquire keys? I could buy them ingame but I instantly lose like 30% value. If I do paypal from someone in the US I have to pay several different fees, I'm not really sure how much they would add up to either. Any advice appreciated!  EDIT: Another question! I literally have 0 trading rep, level 3 steam acc, would people even trust me? I imagine I'd have to do small amounts and go first and try to build up some rep. Anything else I need to do/consider?
2sc2z5	-13901	1421190118	Smite	Lets buff poly?	Better to have it picked up occasionally than not at all, right?  I propose: Increased damage, perhaps 70-80%, but only applies to first auto attack thrown after a spell. This would make it stronger on mages who have a bit of cc, or on players who are skilled at hitting auto attacks. It would also be counterable by aegis or beads and jukes.  Right now its only somewhat decent as a late game item, and it still hardly ever gets picked up. Its an interesting and unique item in the game and its a shame for it to be so bad.  Discuss!

From the end of september for 2 months I lost a fair bit of weight, went down from 175lbs to 154lbs (I'm a 20yo male, 6' tall) I wasnt exactly chubby before but I wanted to slim down alot and then start body building properly. My gym work slowed down a lot since then because of a medical problem but since I lost the weight sitting down has been quite uncomfortable, like my lower back bone seems to be hurting from sitting for too long. Will squatting help me develop some muscle around my legs/bum and make sitting comfortable again?  Or is there anything else I can do?Thanks for any input

2umnsx	-13901	1422965604	h1z1	My take on how to balance the guns/ammo in this game	So right now (in my opinion) ammo spawns way too much, and guns are just about right. In 12 hours we gathered over 3000 bullets, 3 pistols and 2 hunting rifles, no shotguns and ARs. So toning down ammo would be great.  However the important thing to consider is that the guns and ammo which are already collected don't get affected by making them harder to find, meaning that when the spawn rates for guns and ammo are reduced we need a server wipe to make it fair for all players.  Therefore this means that, in order to avoid wiping the server every week, guns and ammo needs to be really scarce and gradually turned up if necessary, because it is still fair to all players when making them more common, but not fair when making them more scarce.  And finally, the duplication hacks/bugs whatever need to be sorted before all of this to keep everything balanced, which is why I don't support the server wipe this week unless the duplication hacks/bugs are fixed by then, otherwise the gun/ammo balance will just end up as retarded as it is now.

2uvoh6	-13901	1423151115	h1z1	Lets discuss aiming: What method do you use?	First person or third? Hip fire or right click to 'zoom'? Standing still, moving, or crouching?  My preferred weapon is the hunting rifle and I crouch in third person and hipfire it, and the bullet nearly always seems to go where the white dot is. When using the AR though I've noticed that first person and zooming in makes the aim recenter after every shot, meaning you can fire much faster and more accurately.  I'm interested to know how everybody else uses their guns.

Why don't we suggest some QoL changes for once, stuff we can live without but would be an appreciated addition to the game.  I'll start:  * Let us rearrange items in the inventory* Show only servers we have characters on (/u/flowdev) - [Already implemented!?](http://www.reddit.com/r/h1z1/comments/2vpdbx/qol_ideas/coju0w8?context=3)* Be able to swim  (deeper water?)

We logged out in a similar position on the map and haven't been able to log in since. I'd rather not delete my character because I have the best gear in the game
2vyvt1	-13901	1424006651	h1z1	Make our names disappear when crouching!	When you lay down your name disappears and it can help you hide. Crouching should have the same effect because there is no reason to crouch unless you are trying to hide.  I've been seen several times hiding in a bush because my name showed and it really sucks, we need this change!
2w8ywf	-13901	1424215061	h1z1	Monitor Bullet damage!?	Can you please send every single shot that occurs back to your server and check the damage it does please. Just got 1 shot by a hacker twice at pleasant valley...  How do I know it was a hacker? Well heres what happened. First time I spin round and start running and get sniped from behind. I got 1 shot and I knew it was a hunting rifle so I presumed I got headshotted by a good shot and it could have been legit. So I respawn at PV luckily and go loot my gear back.. and my helmet was the exact same durability as before, so he had the 1 shot hack obviously. I am looking around and see 2 guys shooting at somebody in the police station so I lay down on my side of the hill and then again I hear 1 bullet and I'm dead, he probably wasn't even aiming at me and it just locked on and dealt 1000000+ damage.  This is pretty ridiculous now, I understand you can't prevent every hack simply but this one shouldn't be too hard? I saw some patch notes for a hack on this subreddit the other day and the 1 shot bullet was on the list as well as a load of other stuff, so I'm assuming most of the people who are hacking are using this and you could ban quite a lot of people. 
2w9abj	-13901	1424220403	pcmasterrace	So what games do you play these days?	Been on the H1Z1 hype lately but the hacking problem has got too big for my enjoyment anymore.  I'm looking for a couple of interesting games to play, preferably games that I can play with 2 of my friends, perhaps an open world game with other real players or just a co-op quest line game.

2wqae5	-13901	1424578764	h1z1	Gamebreaking shotgun bug	Did the earlier, pretty funny but gamebreaking none the less.  So if you have a shotgun and only 1 shell, sometimes it will load it in and the shell will disappear. Then when you click, even though you hear a tick on your side, for everybody else it appears as though you are firing live rounds and blood comes out but no damage is dealt. I was doing it to some guy and he was screaming and laughing about how bad I was and that it was all on stream, then when I told him the bullets weren't real he said I was being reported, gg.  Somebody post this to the issue tracker please, I've never done it before, have no proof and its late at night so I'm going to bed.

Downloaded the latest driver for my Qualcomm Atheros AR9287 from the website, when I try to install it I am told the latest driver is already installed. A complete lie, its 3 years out date.  So I uninstall the old and when I try to install the new its installing a windows driver instead, even though I'm directing it to the folder the new driver is in. How can I solve this?  Right clicking the .inf file and pressing install tells me "the software was tested for compliance with windows logo requirements on a different version of windows and may not be compatible with this version."  I've checked on the website and yes I'm downloading the correct driver. Windows 8 64bit for my exact wireless card.  Please help, I've been having a problem with this wireless card for months and have even bought a new router to try and fix it.   EDIT:So I finally installed a somewhat updated driver. I tried a not so recent one from a different website and it installed using the "have disk" method. Anyway I still need help for my actual problem, I'll try to describe it.  Every so often I randomly get ping spikes to my router - large enough to cause the ping attempt to time out, sometimes it even times out twice. I just purchased a new router which pretty much rules that out and points to windows 8 or the adapter being the problem. What things can I try?  The ping spikes occur randomly and infrequently, from one every 5 mins to one every few hours. The device drivers are updated significantly now (from 2012 to 2014) which doesn't seem to help. Are there any windows settings I can change? Custom software/drivers to install?

My actual speeds on speedtest.net have increased from 15/7 to 41/8! There are plenty of brands to chose from and they're fairly cheap.  Go brothers and enjoy this amazing technology!

Using WiFi or Powerline (basically ethernet through house electrics) on 2 different routers it hasn't made a difference - my ping to the router times out which in turn disconnects me from the internet.This means the router lies within my motherboard, operating system or other programs which are installed surely. I wouldn't know what to test for with the motherboard, and I've looked at my installed programs and can't find anything that looks problematic.  Is there anything I can try before I upgrade to windows 8.1 from windows 8 or not? Its really a last resort and I'm lost for other ideas. Thanks.

I'm using a BenQ 2420Z with DisplayPort connection, I'm pretty sure that combined with the windows drivers is causing this somewhere. I'm on Win 10 but it was happening on windows 8 too.If I leave my PC for say an hour and come back, the PC resumes from the black screen and sometimes about 50% of the time is in a resolution like 800x600 and I have a "DisplayPort Error" message showing up. On windows 8 turning the monitor off/on sometimes fixed it but on windows 10 it doesn't seem to be doing so.  Anything I can try?

It would be limited to the number of slots obviously, so using 6 as an example:  Click Sell All, then adjust the percentage price you want to sell for. E.g. click down -5% 2 times and then OK. It then sells the first 6 items in your inventory for roughly -10%.   Items which don't sell need to be cancelled yourself, and items already taking up slots would mean that it only sells the maximum amount it can.

3cqqdp	-13901	1436488731	2007scape	[Suggestion] Extreme combat potion	Relax, its not the extremes from RS3.  Idea:  Super combat potion + (Expensive item/herb/resource or multiple thereof) + Ranging potion + Magic potion = Extreme combat potion.  The expensive item/herb/resource(s) required should be expensive and bring the overall cost of a potion to between 50k and 100k I think? These potions are obviously very useful and should be expensive to deter them from general use but remain useful for certain scenarios, e.g. PKing/Bosses/Other PvM content.  It should have a high herblore level, maybe 96 would be appropriate?  My Ideas for the "special ingredient(s)" would be perhaps multiple Torstols/snapdragons? Or the unique idea I had was something to do with Zulrah:  Grinding up one of the 4 rare drops would give you some Zulrah Powder or shards, and so many powders/shards are required per Extreme combat potion. In the long run this would balance out the cost of Zulrah items and stop them from dropping to being worth nothing (for example the serp helm which is 500k and falling). Nobody would grind the expensive items either e.g. Tanz fang as they give the same amount of powder/shards as the other items.  So for an Example: Grind Serp visage with pestle and mortar receive 15 powder. Each powder right now would be worth 500k/15 = 33k. So this ingredient would cost roughly 33k, bringing the overall cost of a potion to around 60k?  The Zulrah part is more of an additional idea of how the Extreme combat potion could be implemented, but I get that Zulrah doesn't exactly need more incentives to be killed however it would stop the value of the rare items from plummeting to nothing.  Suggestions/criticism are of course welcome.

3d9qjh	-13901	1436891605	GalaxyS6	S6 Edge still crashing on 5.1.1 with snapchat installed	I had this problem before and although I got some advice it never got solved. When I have snapchat or casper or my device it causes that app and every other app to crash all the time. 5.1.1 came and the problem is still occurring.  I'm looking for some more advice on how I can fix this or how I can flash the 5.1.1 stock firmware using Odin. My main concern with using Odin is that the S6  and S6 Edge are meant to have some sort of protection built in against flashing the device I believe I read somewhere? So that it voids the warranty if I trigger that software. I really don't want to void the warranty because if I bite the bullet and want to return the phone because I suspect it is faulty I won't be able to.  I'm begging for any advise whatsoever here because its been 2 months and my phone is still unusable for what I want it for.  Thank you!  EDIT: My phone seems to vibrate alot when it loses responsiveness, if that helps anyone diagnose the problem? It vibrates like 3 times in very quick succession each vibrate lasting like 0,2 seconds
3db6v6	-13901	1436913235	techsupport	Frame drops in games, dropping CPU usage	I've been getting frame drops since I changed to windows 10 from windows 8 (I did it as a last resort to fix a network problem, it worked).  In resource monitor when my frames drop there is a drop in CPU usage at the same time. So my question is, what could be causing it?  My CPU is running at about 68-70 degrees when this is happening. I've seen it run at 80 before without this happening. The CPU usage is about 70% when the dips are occurring, so its not as though the CPU is being fully utilized. My motherboard is at 53degrees which should be fine, I've read this is important because if the VRMs overheat it throws the CPU off?  And my graphics card is at 90degrees, its a 7870XT and has always ran really hot and I don't think its the problem for the frame drops but it could be.  Updated the drivers with no help, cores don't appear to be parked, I'm on high performance mode.

3f10ag	-13901	1438177571	2007scape	Why are people bothered by high scales prices?	Buying a high priced item is essentially a loan is OSRS, E.g. you can buy an ags, use it for 10 hours, and sell it for a relatively small loss.  I'd personally prefer Scales to cost a lot to keep the high tier items from zulrah expensive to use. If scales cost nothing then everyone will be using blowpipes/serp helms and other content will become obsolete. 
3f3db7	-13901	1438212195	2007scape	Ice barrage is too expensive	The cost of using ice barrage is too expensive just like using a blowpipe so we need an update where we can use a chisel on a staff and convert it into 10k blood runes plz that way high tier content is cheap like it should be.  Does anybody get my point yet? Please fail this poll and allow the Best in Slot items actually have a suitable usage cost, instead of making them an auto-use in all situations.  I'll give an example, if scales drop to almost nothing, there is no reason to use a trident of the seas. 10gp vs a zulrah scale for higher magic accuracy and +3 damage. Cheap scales makes this an auto upgrade, as opposed to thinking such as: Is the activity I am doing worth the extra cost for +3 damage and higher accuracy?

3htyvq	-13901	1440152016	reignofkingsgame	Suggestion - A more complex tax system.	Tax different materials at different rates, seems simple enough. There comes a point where taxing wood is useless, and you'd prefer iron and so on. Having different tax rates for different materials allows you to collect only the ones you want, or even dissuade other players from collecting a material to gather the one you want. E.g. You need stone, tax wood + others 20%, tax stone 10% so its better for them to collect stone.

Should we have a gold membership or not.. I can understand that people might have issues donating as Reddit is owned by a multi-billion dollar company. Corporations on the other hand will do anything to make a venture profitable. They did not buy Reddit so that they can support it however they bought it as an investment and they want returns on it. They will not invest in Reddit unless they get profits out of it. But we don't want to donate a company like that which might be forcing Reddit to be something that we the users don't want it to be. I did donated a small amount to Reddit myself however did not do it to get gold membership but just to help out as if I will help out a friend.I have learned a lot from Reddit ... things that I cannot even imagine.. If for some reason I don't check Reddit for a day.. I feel something is missing from my day. I would not like my favorite place on internet to go bankrupt specially when it is such a large community .. we have such high traffic and good content. Rather than donating why don't we just help out in making the advertisements on Reddit successful. For example there are ads from Amazon on Reddit right now. If I need to buy a book or get a magazine subscription from Amazon, rather than going directly to the website why not use the ad on Reddit. If you have a business why not advertise on Reddit. Its the same way if my friend needs money I can help him out once or twice however it will be more beneficial for him if I get him a job and that's exactly what we need to do. We need get Reddit a job. We have one of the most brilliant minds on Reddit suggest them some good ideas on how they create a good Revenue model that is successful for Reddit. Let us give some good suggestions to the Reddit team so that Reddit can have a successful revenue model. EDIT: We can stop using adblock on Reddit..

We share the kitchen and when he moved into the apartment I as a courtesy told him that if he needs something he can have it. I don't mind sharing food as I cook plenty and if sometimes he takes some it doesn't really matter. This has gone to a point now that he just consumes a big chunk of the meals I cook. I invited a friend over the other day thinking that there will be enough leftover but he literally ate it all. This has happened multiple times now and he doesn't even ask me. Will it be rude if I ask him to stop eating my food. I mean I offered him that at the first place. Please help Reddit. Update - Thanks Reddit .. I will talk to him

During a random conversation with a friend I realized that I eat about 10 pounds of Onions in a Month and about half of those Onions that I consume are in raw form in some sort of salad. Another notable point is that I only eat them with dinner. If I eat these many Onions at work people will probably stop talking to me. Which made me think if I should moderate my Onion intake. However after reading a Wikipedia article about Onions I found the following information which suggests me otherwise. "Onions contain chemical compounds with potential anti-inflammatory, anticholesterol, anticancer, and antioxidant properties, such as quercetin and glycosides like quercetin 3,4'-diglucoside or quercetin-4'-glucoside"Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion#Phytochemicals_and_preliminary_researchI still think the amount of Onions I consume is a lot and I should reduce the intake.  Maybe start a Onions Anonymous Support group however, I don't think I will find more addicts.

Can you please suggest any legal options I have available to stop him for doing that. If he doesn't finish the work it will cost us about Rs. 300,000 to finish the work.

New Years Eve Story Time Title - Dec 31, 2014 - The Day I lost my favorite Sweat Pants So the party I went to last night had few interesting people. It was fun to hangout there with some people and I already know and some who I have never met. The night started winding up around 3 am. I am one of those people who don't like staying and other peoples house. Especially if I don't know them too well. There was this girl at this party who was wearing a dress and at the end of the night asked if someone has a pair of sweat pants. I carried mine with me but I was just planning on sitting on the couch until my roommate sobers up so that he can drive us home. So as a gentleman that I am I gave that girl my sweatpants for the night. What could go wrong right..? Well was on a single seat couch in a basement with 10 other people. Around 4 something I dozed off and woke up to the sound of a couple fucking in the middle of the room and it was the girl who I gave my sweatpants to and some other dude. they were not even being sneaky about it. Once they finished banging they continued to talk fairly loudly and the girl mentioned is a very naughty tome how the guys cam all over the sweat pants the girl was wearing. I face palmed and felt like killing both of them. Somehow I manged to pass the night called my roommate at 8 am and got the fuck out of there. I loved my sweat pants however its time to move on. New Year New Sweat pants. TL;DR - Some random girls borrowed my sweatpants for the night at a party. Fucked and random dude in middle of the night while 10 people were and the dude jizzed all over my favorite sweat pants.

Unless a Sailor gets in some serious trouble, all evaluations are written to place the Sailor in a positive light.  At his rank, the write-up doesn't even matter all that much.  If a promotion board were to look back over serveral years of evals, they still may not have seen the evals quoted in this story.  A promotion board can read through the BS as seen in this article:"Possesses unlimited potential and can become a valuable asset to the command with the proper guidance and self-discipline."That really means: This Sailor requires to be babysat and can't be trusted.Negative evals can negatively impact the fitness reports of senior leadership, so all evals are written to give borderline Sailors the benefit of the doubt.  Once an eval reaches a promotion board, it's easy to break out great performers from the weak.I won't get into Reporting Senior traits and rating averages unless asked, but those play a large part of the evaluation process as well.I can break down this article line by line if necessary, but hopefully I've already made my point pretty clear.  tl;dr: These evaluations are in no way great evaluations.

Regardless, I know the link to the original is posted in r/navy.This is the follow-up.I watched the end of the "old Navy."  I was there for one of the last post-PRT keg parties, cross-dressing, dudes who got the grease-gun up the butt...   I remember ropeyarn Wednesday, going out for a couple beers at lunch.Those were some great times.I also remember seeing a friend of mine beat so badly when he made MM3, they had to fly him off the ship (TRUMAN circa 1997/8).  All of R-Div was at Mast on the messdecks.Some things did get out of control, but I sure miss the fun times.Serving today is so very different. I too mourn the Navy I joined, I really do. But I can't lose focus of the Navy I serve.  Just my two cents.  
1pgk7v	-13909	1383049770	navy	Just some words from a good source (People seem to forget this).	As a Sailor, you represent the Navy. People form their opinions of the Navy based on your appearance and actions. Always wear your uniform with pride. Conduct yourself in a manner that will reflect credit on you and the Navy. In effect, you conduct the business of public relations for the Navy. The way in which you sell the Navy to civilians and the way you sell yourself to your superiors and shipmates determines their opinion of you and of the Navy.A good Sailor is morally responsible. That means you know what’s right and what’s wrong, and you try to do what is right. As a morally responsible person, you perform all assigned duties as correctly and timely as humanly possible without worrying about personal gain or inconveniences.To succeed in any line of work, you must be devoted to duty and be able to take orders. Shipboard life is so exacting that a team of members must do many tasks; one person alone cannot do them. In battle or in solving a battle problem, all personnel must work as a team; and it doesn’t make any difference whether the team consists of a few or many members. The Navy isn’t the place for the immature self-seeker who puts forth his/her best efforts only when some personal advantage is to be gained. Also, the Navy doesn’t have room for the resentful, hardheaded, self-important person who can’t take an order. Rules and regulations serve as guides for daily living and, if followed by all, make life more pleasant and easier for all hands.

1ra8x5	-13909	1385212626	LifeProTips	LPT: to get rid of spilled or dried wax from any surface, use a piece of brown paper bag and a steam iron.	My wife and I got drunk and she waxed my shoulders. Got wax all over the room. I remembered this wax removal trick from my grandmother. Totally worked.Just make sure iron is on and set iron over piece of paper bag.EDIT: NON-SKIN surfaces.  Taxidermy?  Not skin.  However, never attempted wax removal from taxidermy work.EDIT: set for hot. No steam.EDIT: heat melts plastic.  I didn't think that point was necessary to make.  As with anything in life, please use common sense.  I just supplied some simple tools.... I cannot supply you common sense.  However, yes, I will note in this text that heat does indeed melt plastic and plastic items like nylon.EDIT: /u/ramacher brought up a secondary LPT to this thread: Be sure to clean the iron afterward. EDIT 5: I have really had a great deal of fun with this thread! It's been really great answering your questions and comments.I feel I've done a "I soaked up wax with an iron and paper bag - AMA!"Seriously, thanks for entertaining me and if this helped anyone: thank my Grandma! She was an awesome lady!Ok, edit 6. I've been drinking for a few hours. Watching a band with my wife. 1) thank you again. And 2) didn't realize I made the front page. I am truly humbled by almost 1,200 up votes. Amazing. All this did was help me remember how great my grandmother was. She had 1/3 of her brain removed for a tumor in 1985.

1rfnur	-13909	1385405722	Military	Lurker observation	I don't post in here very often, if even ever.  This may be my first post here.Great subReddit. I really enjoy that this is an international group.True to the military mindset, there are people and personalities ranging from no-nonsense to purely nonsense.I love it. I keep debating about my retirement date. I may be reenlisting for the last time next year.  But it's the humor in subs like this that I will miss most when I do retire. I'm a desk jockey at a staff shore assignment. The most junior person here made Chief two years ago.I miss what I will miss right now -- being in the company of young, funny Sailors, Marines, Soldiers and even the occasional airman.I've done a DOD and a NATO tour. I've worked with everyone. I've been really lucky to say I have worked with everyone.I am not a karma whore, nor am I a SEAL.  But I have stood the watch as conn on a nuclear carrier for almost three years as a CPO -- something I will always be proud of.Starting to wonder why I wrote all this myself.... I guess the SEAL AMA (yeah, I know, enough already). Bullshit or not, the follow-on NOT a Navy SEAL AMA was fucking funny -- that's the humor I miss now and will miss a few years from now.Anyway: why would a SEAL selling a book not peddle that shit in the IAMA Sub?  And I'm just thinking out loud here.  But why limit your audience/perspective buyers to only a percentage of your potential?  I wish I saw the thread sooner.  I wish he was still on. I have marketing questions to ask a SEAL -- and of course he totally gets the concept... Right?  Perhaps not. That whole commercial about writing a book about your life... I've just done it.Ok, well NMCI seems to have reloaded. Back to work.If you don't get NMCI.  Just know you're better off not knowing.

2kpv2i	-13909	1414618759	navy	Five years ago today, a great Sailor rested his oars.	Posted in your honor, Pops!I'm guessing that like most people he contacted, it was a call out of the blue while I was at work one morning from a man with a gruff voice and a presence that could be felt through the receiver.“Hey Shipmate, it’s Pops.”“Who?”“Pops. Pops Schultz. I just read your post on Together We Served. I liked what you said.”I joined the military social site Togetherweserved in February 2007. By March, I found myself having regular conversations with several Chief Petty Officers in the “Goat Locker” forum. Retired Command Master Chief Christopher “Pops” Schultz was among the regulars. I was genuinely surprised by the phone call and can’t recall much else of it, but it was the first of many, of which I recall most of the latter conversations verbatim.The most important was the invitation to visit him and his family for a few days in Ridgecrest, Calif., as I made my transit from Va. Beach to Everett, Wash., in the summer of 2007. I told him I would consider it and didn’t give it much more thought. Over the next few months, the calls between us were more frequent. The conversations online, although light and usually pretty funny, were also bringing us closer as friends. Although the trip to visit him was nearly 800 miles out of the way, I said I would stay at his place for a few days.What happened next impacted just about everything I see and do in this world. A few days before leaving Va. Beach I got a call from another retired Master Chief. “Hey, I just want to let you know that what you’re doing isn’t just a good, Chiefly thing to do, it’s a good Christian thing to do.”I didn’t really know what he meant. I’m not the most religious person on the planet. I also never took the time to really understand all the problems Pops was having. Our conversations were usually light and silly. I knew he had a few physical issues, but didn’t know much else. Then I read up on Pops. He was an Old Salt, a tried and true Sailor and Chief. A Viet Nam vet who served in some very tough patrols. He eventually became one of the Navy’s first professional career counselors and later served and retired as a Command Master Chief New Year’s Day, 1989. Years later, the results of his service and sacrifice became apparent. He had complications relating to Agent Orange exposure. He suffered from diabetes, pulmonary fibrosis, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease and pulmonary hypertension. Even still I had no idea how much pain and inconvenience he suffered on a daily basis. To this day, the day of his passing, I still cannot begin to fathom any of that. I met Pops at a Walmart not far from his house.Ridgecrest is like an oasis town in the middle of the Mojave Desert. Pops exited his much-bragged-about, brand new Toyota RAV4 with his oxygen tank in hand.That’s when the "Chiefly" comment began to make sense for the first time. Pops shook my hand, gave me a hug, said he thought I would be bigger and then told me to follow him home. We got to his house just in time for him to lower the Colors on his front lawn at 1700, just as he did every day –from 0800 to 1700 his flag flew proudly in the front yard of this home. He grilled me up a steak, poured me and himself, yes he cheated a little, a nice glass of scotch and talked until his wife, Tess, came home from her job as a nurse at the local hospital. They are the perfect couple.Over the next four days this man pushed himself beyond his limits to show me everything from Mt. Whitney to the Manzanar War Relocation Center and Lone Pine, the site where many of the first cowboy and western movies were filmed. Throughout these adventures were the times he had to stop to give himself insulin and change his oxygen tanks –the reminders of his condition I tried to block out my entire visit.When we weren’t sight-seeing, he filled hours with sea stories from his 24 years of service. Stories that included monkeys and chickens running free about a ship shortly after pulling out of an Asian port, and stories about his personal heroes who had long since passed, which would bring tears to his eyes. Not all were sea stories. He was a wealth of wisdom and knowledge in leadership and could have held seminars on how to be a great, well-respected person in any organization or community. Much of what he talked about immediately changed many of my behaviors and attitudes. Of all the places we visited, none compare to our trip to Albertson’s.He had introduced me to so many people up to this point. His daughters and family , we visited and had dinner with his son, Chris and some friends. Met a few of his neighbors… I’m from Jersey. If someone tells me we’re going to Albertson’s I’m going to think of people… the Albertson’s.Pops took me to a grocery store –Albertson’s. Until this point, about the third day of my visit, we’d had gone out for sushi, we had breakfast at Denny’s… and EVERYONE knew him. It seemed everywhere we went, people knew him, and asked if I was the “friend from Virginia he’d been talking about.”Albertson’s was a lesson in just how great a man Pops Schultz truly IS, even in his passing. He was the Command Master Chief of Albertson’s grocery store. He knew every manager of every department by name. He knew what sports their kids played. He knew EVERYTHING about ALL OF THEM. And they all asked the same question about me being the friend from Virginia, to which he replied “he’s from Virginia, but this is my other son.”Pops became my Pops at that moment. Everything I could ever think to admire about any one was a complete stranger only a few months before. In three days it seemed like we knew everything about each other. This man is my hero. I left on the morning of the fourth day. I had an 1,100 mile journey still ahead of me to Everett. I cried. I cried from the time I left Ridgecrest until I reached Portland, Ore. I cried so much I had to pull over.   I frequently teach classes on the Lincoln about leadership and character. I always tell this story. Some days I can get through it without crying, most days I can't. I’m crying right now.This man, Christopher Moore Schultz knew more about living life to the fullest than most other people will ever come close to understanding. This man was dying –for years and never went a day afraid or deterred to face the challenge ahead. He kept his sense of humor even when things were at their worst.In an email update from his wife Tess, she captured the essence of the character her husband amazingly contained for 63 years in a singular human body: “Yes it has been hard and I truly thought he was dying two weeks ago. He thought so too...we made arrangement with the mortuary before he went to the hospital. He was telling them that all he wanted was to be thrown into the back of the truck, taken to the crematorium and thrown into the fire. They told him they were sorry but by law they had to transport him in a container so he picked out a cardboard box that looks like what you'd do your moving in. They were so compassionate and quiet at first but he got them laughing and it made the ordeal much easier to take. When they asked what kind of container he wanted his ashes in he told them an old cigar box will do. He said that he won't go out without his sense of humor. Crazy guy....but I love him.”God bless you, Pops! Enjoy your rest! You will always be missed and never forgotten!http://i.imgur.com/3YC7771.png

Asshole.Those were my monikers from age 6 until I finally left that house at age 23.I was raised in a highly abusive household by a drunken, ex-soldier with severe PTSD (not combat related, I think he and a few of his Army buddies killed a black man in the 60s - I have no proof, just a suspicion). He rarely wore clothes in the home. He would kick my door in on weekend mornings, butt naked and bark orders at me to do chores; everything from yard work to washing and waxing his cars. "Get your lazy ass up, you white nigger!" Was my alarm clock on weekends.My mom tried protecting me. I was the oldest kid of four living in that house, and the only one not his by blood. My mom's first husband was also fucked up and enjoyed watching her sleep with friends. So, I don't know who my real father was. Today, none of that matters. She remarried a man she thought was stable, but turned out to be mad with anger.He once walked into the living room just to pull my hair hard enough to make me cry, and then he walked off. I went to school with a fat lip a few times. I was forced to drink a glass of whiskey (at age 8). He forced me to give him back and scalp massages, and rub his feet; him naked on the bed. I still get a pit in my stomach over the memories.Jew Boy was written on every lunch bag I carried to the bus stop. He took pleasure in writing that. My neighbor one morning caught me throwing a bag into a growing pile in the corner of his yard. The contents of the bag were always the same: four slices of bread. The neighbor just looked knowingly at me and didn't say a word.By high school I was a full-blown daily pot and acid head. These were my escapes from the horror at home. I went to school regularly on acid. Looking back, I have no idea how I was able to maintain so well. I was always high.... Until I got busted my junior year; at school and led away in handcuffs.Part of my punishment (thank God I was a minor), was to go to rehab and fulfill hundreds of hours of public service through speaking at high schools, institutions, and even two state prisons about drug abuse. I was really good at it. I was so good at public speaking, I was nominated for a state award and wound up at a dinner with the state senator.I returned to high school and graduated at the age of 20. During these same years (my bust and return to school), my step dad was caught in an affair and had moved out. Sadly, he and my mother reconciled shortly after I graduated.I had a very hard time with girls and relationships. I left high school a virgin. But shortly after, I met a girl I would later marry.She knew about all my baggage, but didn't know how I was still unable to cope with all of it.At 22, following an argument, I made the correct of two choices: I called the suicide crisis hotline and was hospitalized. Following my stay, I was placed in a state half-way house. I started to rebuild myself. I got my first apartment (one room; shared a communal bathroom with three other tenants, all of whom had mental disorders). My girlfriend stayed at my side. I wanted to marry her, but no career, no real place to live, no real outlook for the future....So, I joined the military. Nearly 20 years later, I'm still in, and it was absolutely the best decision I ever made. From the time I entered Boot Camp until the day reported to my current job, I have loved every minute of my time in service. My ex wife knew I'd found my life, and it just wasn't a life she wanted. We're still friends. She tried for eight years, but it just wasn't what she wanted. But she knew I was happy.I stayed single for 10 years before I met my current wife who introduced me to my daughter. I never wanted a kid. I never wanted to risk becoming the monster who raised me.I didn't. I love that kid. She's almost old enough to drive, and I'm not rich by any real standard, but that young lady has a car in the driveway.But how? I titled this "how I." I forgave that man. I forgave that man and took away one simple lesson: NEVER be like that man. I treat those in my life with as much respect and kindness I can offer.I forgave a monster.Today, that man is a shell of what he once was. He's in his 60s and can't hold a job. He's addicted to pain pills. He's hopeless. And I don't do the happy dance over his situation. It's sad. He's a sad, scared old man.I forgave him, but I'll never forget what he did.

3h5vwu	-13909	1439693658	navy	Best sea stories; what's yours?	I'll start with one of my favorites:St. Thomas 1997. We pulled in Thanksgiving weekend.  Me and my two best buds (I was a PO3, Sea Daddy was a PO1 and our sidekick was a PO2) hit Fat Tuesdays at fleet landing.  We walked off with some frozen drinks and sat on a concrete wall.I looked across the street from where we were sitting, and there was a bar with no roof (it had blown off in a recent hurricane), and two locals were drinking beer out of a cooler.  I announced I wanted to go drink with them. My buddies protested, but then followed me over there.  It was a most awesome decision."Guinness is good for you!" they shouted as they handed each of us a can.  It wasn't until I looked at the can that it actually said "Guinness is good for you" under the logo. And, at 7%, it sure was.  Nothing like actual Guinness cans from Ireland.  Anyway, they were selling us Guinness cans for a $1 each.  It was an amazing moment in time.  But this is just the start of the story.Me and the 1st class put in for leave for the port visit - approved.  No duty.  Four days in St. Thomas.  Within the first hour, we are drinking $1 Guinness in a blown-out bar.  Then, in walks Calypso Sis.  Calypso Sis owned the bar.  And, since we were the only American Sailors who immediately came to visit her bar, she gave us full fucking run of the bar.  And I mean she gave us her kitchen, bar and whatever the fuck we wanted.  We were grilling burgers and cooking food.  We were ridiculous.  We made her laugh.  She went and got her guitar and sang Bob Marley songs while we ate and drank all afternoon.  Then, something even more amazing happened; she offered us her apartment for the entire weekend.  Fucking unbelievable.  And we spent Thanksgiving weekend in the fucking ghetto slums of St. Thomas.  Cock roaches big enough to scare anyone.  Gun shots throughout the night.  It was fucking scary.  Calypso Sis didn't stay with us.  She stayed with her girlfriend, like real girlfriend.  And left us to our own in her place.I was fucked up and finally passed out on the couch in the living room.  No idea what time it was when I woke up to see a FUCKING HUGE dude with massive dreadlocks standing over me and looking down.... my heart stopped and I thought I was going to die.  He just shook his head and walked further into the apartment.... and entered the master bedroom where he witnessed my buddies having a sword fight with two dildos they found.  It turned out this huge, scary guy was Calypso Sis' son.  And he had a sense of humor.  Thank God.  He only said two words that I remember; "No worries." And then he left us to carry on.We spent the next two days hanging at Calypso Sis' bar and encouraging our shipmates to join us for food and drinks.  We were charging them.  But we were also serving them.  Fair enough.  We offered to give the money to Sis, but she refused.The third day, the PO2 in our crew had duty.  Calypso Sis had one request for all her hospitality: bring me a ballcap from your ship.  That's all she fucking wanted.  It was a Saturday.  The ship's store was open.  PO2 had the ball on this one.  Just get her a fucking hat.He left the next morning on the liberty launch and forgot to buy her a fucking hat.  It was now Sunday. Ship's store was closed.  That motherfucker forgot the most important thing ever.  We were leaving for liberty expiration later that day.  Calypso Sis wore a rasta hat every time we saw her, except that morning at the bar.  She wore no hat.  She wanted a ship's ballcap.  And that motherfucker forgot it.Almost 20 years later and I'm still pissed at that dude.  Me and that PO1 busted his balls every day until he transferred.  We offered to mail her a hat.  She refused.  I swore that I would one day return to St. Thomas, and it just hasn't worked out.  If you ever go, and meet Calypso Sis, please tell her an American Sailor never forgot her kindness, and only wishes she had gotten her ballcap -- every fucking day.TLDR, you should just read it. HAFND.

I am very fortunate to have tuition, living expenses, books, etc completely covered financially wherever I go, regardless of cost (thank you, grandma). I also will have worked in HI (a little in the courts, mostly legislature, and some in private firms) for almost four years by the time I go back to school, so there are those connections here at home.I'm drawn to HI because of the low tuition, no rent to pay, I'll know a bunch of people there, and local connections. However, I really want to get away for a while. I love home and want to end up here eventually, but I want to explore.What to do, what to do?

1zim2g	-13921	1393925065	Rowing	Uncooperative knees on the erg	In a horrible lapse in judgement I've gotten back on the erg to burn off holiday fat stores, and I'm having some trouble with my knees:1) At the finish they don't seem to be completely flat, that is, my legs are still a little bent. 2) When I do try to completely straighten my legs, coming back up to the catch feels like my knees are double jointed and I have to go from bending backwards to straight to bending the normal way again...it's a weird sensation.I don't know if this makes any sense but I hope someone has some answers! I thought maybe about just moving the foot stretchers to a different number, but I'm not sure which way to go. I also thought maybe I'm just out of practice and should go painfully slow to get correct form back.Thanks!

2wpjg8	-13921	1424563448	LawSchool	Anyone been to Bucerius Law School in Hamburg for the international business/comparative law fall program?	I'm currently a 1L, this exchange would be for my Fall 2L semester. My law school has an exchange program with Bucerius. I spent a chunk of last summer in Munich/Berlin and loved both, but I've never been to Hamburg.My main concern is the tension between having no experience in/idea if international business/comparative law actually interests me, and never being able to do this sort of fun abroad experience again. I would pay my own law school's tuition (~$10K/semester) but need to pay for food/housing/books/etc which wouldn't result in any debt for me. Airfare is usually covered by friends of the exchange program.Has anyone here studied at Bucerius/heard anything about it? Is jumping in to this area of law a bad idea? Thoughtful thoughts appreciated.

The garage is heated. As I've been working on the house the boiler (and my oil) is burning more than I thought necessary. Turns out the 3rd air handler is calling for all if the heat.The 3rd air handler is ducted to an apartment over the garage and the garage itself. There is an old round Honeywell trol a temp stat with heat and fan controls in the apartment which I have set to 50 degrees. In the garage is the same round trol a temp dial with no fan or heat controls..dial only. I need to turn "off" this garage stat as I don't need the heat in the garage...or the cost.Can I just swap out the garage stat with another cheap 4 wire stat with hot/cold and or fan?  Will I even be able to turn it off with this since it is a slave and I have no zoning panel?Thanks in advanceMax

Thanks in advance.We just had new hardwood floors installed, wide plank character white oak.  Choosing character grade, we were looking for the knots and imperfections in the wood, we like the look.The entire project was about 750 sqft, on certain planks they left clearly broker/split ends (not naturally occurring fissures/knots/cracks). see images.Floor was installed yesterday, they filled some bigger knots today, and tomorrow they will sand and stain.Is this proper that they used these planks, there was well over 6-8 full planks of extra wood or boards they could have used instead of these.  Am I within my right to  question why these were used and not better planks? once they are down, theres no way to pull them back up correct?Thanks to all those with insight, much appreciated.Maxhttp://imgur.com/a/mcMwG

3cmasq	-13931	1436402500	HVAC	Air handler Click but won't blow	Hi r/HVAC, you've helped me in the past so I'll come back to the well.I have a hydro air heat and ac unit. Over the winter I changed out an old Honeywell troll a temp mercury round stat for a digital one, 6 wires, O,YB,G,W and R.All worked fine.Went to fire up ac and no dice. Compressor nor air handler came on.Heard click at air handler when fan set to on, but no motor. Put in old stat to make sure it wasn't a comparability issue and same thing, AH click, no blow, no compressor.Other relevant info, there is a zoned slave stat in this system as well.What would be common trouble shooting for why I would get click but that's allMany many thanks in advanceMax

3cy3cb	-13931	1436647250	electricians	Outside circuit breaker was tripped- when I flipped it- the whole breaker box RUMBLED.	So our AC wasn't working, and upon normal trouble shooting of the HVAC all seemed in good order, but the condenser wouldnt turn on.First stop was the breaker box and low and behold- the outdoor double circuit was tripped.  When I reset it the entire box starter to shake and rumble, ~~and then tripped again~~Trying to call in an electrician, but im trying to educate myself here first.  Any insight or suggestion would be great.Thanks
3d0qyy	-13931	1436715039	HVAC	Rumbling/ and loud banging in breakerpanel when flip breaker from condenser.	HI R/HVAC.Sorry I'm here again.Quick background- condenser wasnt starting. checked breaker, was tripped.  Flipped, made sounds then tripped again.  A while later flipped again (video) and the same noise continued, but breaker didnt trip and condenser worked.What noise you ask.  enjoy.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrjTrJIpySsSent to my electrician, he said he had never head that noise ever.I flipped it off for safety, and have him coming out tomorrow.My question for r/HVAC.Does this sound like anything, maybe a short at the unit, or more likely just a bad breaker.Its brutal hot today in CT and having a 2 year old bday party.Once it runs teh cycle with the banging, the breaker stays good so i could but unit on, i just want to make sure im not gonna cause damage to the unit.posted first in r/electricians...varied opinions.  Suggested I check with you guys on equiptment.thanks as always.max

1pige1	-13951	1383100373	Rowing	Somewhat Nervous	So let me give you a little history in my rowing career before i get into my question. I rowed for 2 years in high school. I was okay, a bit above average, but nothing special. After I graduated I went to a school that didn't have rowing, but I transferred my sophomore year to University of Maryland: College Park where there is rowing. This weekend is our first regatta (that novices get to participate it). We just got our line-ups and they put me in the varsity 8. I had to re-read twice to make sure it was correct. I don't really know what to think about this. To be honest, I'm terribly nervous. I don't think I have done anything to warrant being put in this boat. All of the guys are super nice and I don't want to let them down. But I just don't know quite why Im in this boat or how to not let down my team since the rest of the boat are all varsity guys that are much faster than I am. I need your guys' advice. Sorry for the long post.TLDR; I'm in a boat for my first race in 2 years with guys that are better than I am. How do I not screw them over in the boat?
1qmx4p	-13951	1384458788	yugioh	Help with a school project	For those of you who are over the age of 15, or have ever been scrutinized (by your peers, parents, etc.) for playing yugioh due to your age or other reasons, can you please give me a one line quote that explains your stance on the argument of if there is an age that is too old for the game. I am currently 20 years old and love the game, but my parents are not the biggest fans of it to say the least, and half of my friends just laugh it off whenever it's brought up. So, when I got the opportunity to write a project on the matter (it was open-ended) I thought "why not?" If you could just give me a school-appropriate quote that states your mind on the matter, that would be great. Thanks!

1t78ww	-13951	1387405548	pokemon	How long have they been doing these new rarities?	So, my friend and I used to play/collect back when pokemon first hit American markets and since then its been like 13 years or so. I thought that it would be fun this Xmas I could find some old starter decks and get a few packs for the each of us and we could play again for a good nostalgia trip. Anyway, I got myself a couple packs just for a little nostalgia and there are so many different rarities now. I was hoping you guys could shed some light on what they are/mean. So I got a full card art Emolga (favorite pokemon from gen 5 :)), two cards that were holo in the colored area but not the picture, one that was holofoil everywhere (I figured possibly one foil in every pack now?) and a few that are pretty subtle. They have stars printed everywhere on the but are only visible when the light hits them right. I was just wondering what the different styles of rarity mean or if there's nothing special about them at all. Thanks!

The page says it may take a couple weeks for them to get back to me with an application. I was wondering if anyone else here has taken the test and heard back from Konami. If so, how long did it take for them to contact you and what steps did you take to start judging locals, regionals, or YCSs? I definitely want to do as much as I can, but I don't really know where to go from here. TLDR; I just passed the Konami RC-1 test. What steps should I take now?
1yhsbc	-13951	1392944824	yugioh	R/F Synchro Heroes (I goofed and deleted my original post)	I tried to edit my original post, but accidentally deleted it. So here's the deck with extra. Ignore the side deck, those are just cards I'm testing out. Here's the deck visual: http://i.imgur.com/tqdvAdm.pngMonster (11):3 Neos Alius (Staple)3 Bubbleman (Staple)3 Photon Thrasher (Great for Xyzing and 0 def is nice)2 Masked Chameleon (Really nice to synchro with Thrasher or xyz)Spells (19):1 ROTA (Staple) 3 Emergency Call (Staple) 3 Duality (Makes it a lot easier to get to my monsters)2 Super Poly (LOVE stealing monsters with this)3 Miracle Fusion (Staple) 3 MST (Staple) 1 Book of Moon (Not sold on this. Might take out for Wild Heart)3 Gemini Spark (I tested at 2, but I like it at 3)Traps (10):3 Fiendish Chain (With no Veilers, this is imperative)1 Solemn Warning (Staple) 1 Bottomless (Staple) 1 Compuls (Staple) 2 Mirror Force (Great against the Fire Fist matchup)2 Dimensional Prison (Like, but may be a better side deck card)Extra (15):2 Absolute Zero (Staple) 2 The Shining (Staple)1 Nova Master (Really good against Fire Fist with Super Poly)1 Gaia (Why not? It can be okay at times)1 Escuridao (Not completely sold on this)2 King of Feral Imps (So good and easy to make)1 GEM Knight Pearl (Ophion is the most annoying)1 Gagaga Cowboy (Love burning for game)1 Stardust (If you can make Lv8 synchros, I think it's a staple)1 Crimson Blader (So good against Hieratics/Mermails)1 Scrap Dragon (Good spot removal)1 Colossal Fighter (So good with so many warriors and recycling) A typical play is making King of Feral Imps if possible to get Chameleon. Then synchro/XYZ depending on the situation. This deck is great at slowing your opponent down until you get your combo pieces and exploding when the time is right. Tell me what you think of it and any ideas you may have. Thanks!
1zgd2g	-13951	1393872473	relationship_advice	I [20/M] think that I royally screwed up and don't know what to do and could really use some help.	I have never posted or commented here before, but I'm starting to fear that my relationship is in dangerous waters and it's all my fault. I'm really just looking for some advice and I didn't know where to turn. First, here's some backstory: in the fall of 2012 I fell really sick. Sick enough to bring me back home from college to miss a semester. Bless my GF's [20/F] soul she came and saw me every day and spent every night that she could with me at my house while I recovered. I transferred out of my college and am now attending school with my GF. Now in the present time, she is in a similar situation except she's sick. We live in the same apartment at school and I spend days and nights with her, not out of obligation, but because I want her to get better as soon as she can and if I can help that by being there then there is no other place I would rather be. Last night, as I'm sure you are aware were the Oscars on TV. My GF likes to stay at her home over the weekends and I also like being there with her, so we have spent a bunch of weekends there. But, I came back last night to our apartment to watch the Oscars since she doesn't have a TV at her house. I'm kind of a movie buff and so the Oscars are like my Super Bowl. During the awards I texted her and Fbook messaged her. She texted me back and I texted her back, but after the awards I fell asleep. It's been a pretty long week and I am exhausted most of the time. But, when I was asleep I missed a call and messages from my GF saying she was feeling particularly sick and could really use to talk to me. But, I stupidly fell asleep and was not able to respond. I feel so stupid since she has done everything for me and when she needed me most I wasn't there. I love her so much and I hate that I just can't do for her what she has done for me. Now, I just have this feeling that I have screwed up for the last time. I could really use some advice on how to move forward. Anything would be appreciated. And if you just want to call me scum, don't waste your time. I already feel like shit over this and I really just want to know if there's anything I can do. Thank you.

It's kind of bugging me out that something that could trigger an emotional reaction is just gone forever. Does this happen to anyone else?

The only downside I see is lack of euls = somewhat pressed for mana, but a bottle/soul ring solves this quite easily.Thoughts?

2t96br	-13969	1421900190	TrueDoTA2	Why is troll so popular right now?	I've heard a lot about how the bkb nerf hit heroes like luna, gyro etc., heroes reliant on bkb hard, and that's why they aren't being picked in the competitive scene right now. What's different about troll? He relies on being able to attack and lifesteal for his sustain, and stuns/disables kill that. As bkb charges run low, he falls off. Is he being picked solely for early game potential? I've heard others say that many teams underestimated his ult beforehand, and are only now realizing its power. Is it that he was underrated before, and the 6.83 buff pushed him over the edge? I'm confused.

Alright I know heart's been getting bashed a lot on the new pl because "he's not a splitpusher anymore" etc. but I've been looking at a lot of the dotabuff top 100 pl players, it looks like a lot of them still build it. Most notably this guy taki with 2000 games on pl, dotabuff #1, http://www.dotabuff.com/players/51823648/matches?date=&amp;hero=phantom-lancer&amp;skill_bracket=&amp;lobby_type=&amp;game_mode=&amp;region=&amp;faction=&amp;duration= . I think the reasoning behind it is that pl can be very hard to locate among his illusions, and he'll have illusions as long as he's attacking, so if you have enough tank to begin the illusion orgy you're infinitely more survivable. Thoughts?

3fvnvs	-13979	1438785014	fantasybaseball	Richie Shaffer is here	Can you feel it in your plums? He's 3B eligible. Hit a HR in his second major league game last night. The 2012 first round pick mashed 16 HR in 55 AAA games this year. Who is making a purchase at Richie Shaffer BMW? Could he possibly save Pablo Sandoval owners from their season long misery?EDIT: he just got pinch hit for in the 5th after CWS put in a righty reliever. No bueno.
