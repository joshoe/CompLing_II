2ov9wn	-54004	1418223820	hiphopheads	Kendrick Lamar signs with Reebok, will design shoes and streetwear for 2015 release	**You can find more info on the partnership at [Reebok's website](http://fitness.reebok.com/Kendrick-Lamar/Stories/2014-12/ThisIsKendrick/).**December 10, 2014 (Canton, MA) – The brand committed to continuously pushing boundaries through partnerships with some of the biggest names in the industry, Reebok takes the fusion of music and footwear to a whole new level with Kendrick Lamar. Together, Reebok and one of the most prolific artists in music today, will inspire and empower youth to become their best selves through programs designed to provide a positive alternative to the streets. Their shared goal provides the creative foundation for a short film released to announce the partnership.“Reebok has a history of helping kids in the community realize their potential is limitless. I saw what the brand was doing, and I wanted to be a part of it and make it even stronger. It’s as simple as that. Kids that listen to my music are looking for inspiration. It’s important that I continue that message in anything I represent,” said Lamar.Reebok and Kendrick Lamar bring their joined vision of celebrating the limitless potential of youth through a short film created to pay homage to kids in Lamar’s hometown of Compton, CA.  The video, “Reebok Presents Kendrick Lamar,” was directed by acclaimed director Anthony Mandler and was shot at locations that hold true meaning in Lamar’s life.  A nod to his roots, the short film features today’s standouts at his alma mater, Centennial High School.  The youth featured in this film are showcased to inspire the new generation to find their voice, and not to be afraid to become their best selves. The short is narrated by Kendrick through a powerful verse called “Kendrick Lamar – I AM” -- his own personal ode to Compton.“Reebok has a long history of working with trail-blazing music artists, but we knew a partnership with a lyricist like Kendrick had to mean something bigger for our brand.  With Kendrick, Reebok truly finds a new voice, and together we look forward to launching ground-breaking projects over the coming months,” said Todd Krinsky, Global Vice President of Reebok Classics and Entertainment.Kendrick fans will get their first glimpse of the Ventilator OG, debuting January 15th within the short film. As part of the new partnership, Kendrick will be featured in Reebok’s global campaign celebrating the 25th Anniversary of Reebok’s iconic Ventilator shoe, which will debut in March 2015. Kendrick will also create his own limited edition capsule collection for Fall/Winter 2015, which will include signature Ventilator styles inspired by the artist’s life, style, and personality and will be available as of June 2015. A Reebok fan since he was a kid, Kendrick grew up wearing what he called “TeeBos and Rees” (white tee, Jabo jeans and Reebok Classics).  Today, his Reebok shoes of choice are the Ventilator, and the Classic Nylon. “My style is simple, but with an edge – and it’s as classic as that,” said Lamar.

I've been lurking in this sub for over a year now, and while there have been some progress pics before, it seems that since becoming a default, they've become a much, much larger portion of the posts here. Considering the fact that /r/progresspics exists (and is another great sub) and that dime-a-dozen progress pics are really only motivating *if that kind of progress your particular goal*, should we still allow these posts?
2571j4	-54013	1399709607	biology	Jobs for a recent bio grad that allow full-time school?	I'm about to graduate from a large, decently prestigious state school with a B.S. in Biology, with a 2.8 GPA. Long story short, my academics were seriously damaged by two years of depressive immature cowardice, itself a result of undiagnosed ADHD. Since my diagnosis this January my academics are *much* better – a 3.8 for the semester, a TA gig this summer for biochemistry, etc.My ultimate goal is to go on to medical school and become a physician scientist, but to get into medical school I'm going to have to take a lot of post-bacc classes to raise my undergrad GPA. I harbor no illusions about the difficulty of this path I'm choosing, but it's the pain I choose. Circumstances dictate that my tuition will be covered for the two years of post-bacc work I need, but I'm ineligible for federal financial aid and have no co-signer for private loans, so I'll need to work to live while taking ~15 hours a semester.So far the plan is to scribe in an ER full-time or part-time, which typically pays about $9 hourly. I'd supplement that with tutoring at anywhere from $10 an hour online to $40 an hour in person. However, this kind of work schedule would be very difficult to manage, and would leave no room for extracurriculars or sanity, and would likely hold me back in my academics, which are the top priority.I'd really prefer a flexible full-time job that pays enough for me to have time for extracurriculars, but I know the job market isn't great. Given that I have very inconsistent lab experience, none of which is in my intended field (stem cell biology), could I potentially network my way into a lab tech position? What other options do I have?**TL;DR Graduating with a BS, but need to pursue more undergrad full-time while working: do I *have* to become a barista?**
26cyvq	-54013	1400912376	Christianity	I need your help. I'm struggling with certain ideas. Am I Christian enough?	*I'm sorry this is so long. I can't really TL;DR it. You seem a peaceful bunch, so I thought I'd ask you all for help reconciling or shifting some issues I'm working through with my beliefs. I really appreciate it.*To start, I'll give some information on my religious background. Growing up an only child in the US, Christianity was always present, but never explicit. Neither of my parents go to church, but they're members of a Christian culture. I know my mom considers herself Christian, and it's of moderate importance to her, but it's really only visible through her extreme charity, which is what I admire most about her. I think my dad believes in God, but I don't think he would necessarily consider himself Christian. From what I can glean he respects people, nature, and righteousness, but isn't at all concerned with dogma.My early religious experiences came from pre-K at a church, vacation bible school in the summers as a child, and a few too many funerals for my largely Catholic extended family. In middle school, I independently decided to start attending the Methodist church near my house. I cry when I hear Switchfoot's "Beautiful Letdown." I hung out with YoungLife kids in high school and thought it was cool, though I rarely went. If a group of missionaries or evangelicals approach me, I earnestly share my beliefs and pray with them if they offer. I can talk about God to a select few people, but I love to do it. I'm always trying to figure out what I believe. Where the dogmatic elements are concerned, it's a spiritual tide of faith and doubt.Having reached early adulthood, I'm learning what is and isn't important to me. I'm exploring everything I can think to, including but not limited to my faith. I definitely believe in God. That's the only absolute for me. I just graduated with a biology degree and want to be a physician-scientist, and when I look at the complexity and diversity of the natural world I just feel so happy. I don't necessarily buy into the logic of the watchmaker analogy. I believe in God because I believe in God, and I think the universe is beautiful because I think the universe is beautiful. Still, my personal beliefs about God, creation, and the universe make everything from evolution to robotics to biochemistry to music seem like wonderful emergent properties of something grand beyond our comprehension, if that makes sense. Whatever doctrine may be true, I recognize that my experience of life is the summary result of some powerful force of goodness. Some call it nature, some call it meaningless. I call it "grace". I believe in the human capacity for good. I find hope and love in many places that it seems many others do not. Hellenistic philosophy really speaks to me. I've found myself earnestly seeking truth, virtue, authenticity, and goodwill among men. In my personal life I've found great power in the writings of Marcus Aurelius, whose deeds against Christians are disturbing but who I believe possessed some great wisdom nonetheless. At my most positive, I see all of this as grand manifestation of divine influence (the specifics of which aren't really important to me).I believe in Christ as an important part of this divine influence. I say grace at meals. I pray in times of fortune and times of hardship.There are certain people I've met who just strike me as being extremely holy simply for the light they bring wherever they go, independently of their own religious beliefs. Faith, hope, and love, right?So what are my challenges here? Somewhat paradoxically, I tend to find myself rather upset by what I characterize as "displays of religiosity". I'm not referring to the intersection of bigotry and Christianity, although that bothers me too. I'm referring to unreasonably long Facebook posts about carrots or graduation or vacation where every sentence contains those Christianist buzzwords. To me, this sort of thing resembles the displays put on in the Massachusetts Bay Colony or those horrible hypocritical private schools. I feel guilty about this. It seems to follow logically from the central concepts of Christianity (as I understand them) that if we truly love our neighbors, we should want to go out and explicitly share Christ with them. Thus, the more Jesus on our Facebook, the better. But this doesn't sit well with me, and I don't know why. Even if I know the person posting it is being wholly sincere, it still makes me uncomfortable. Perhaps I subconsciously believe that all such displays really are just phony. Perhaps I associate this type of thing with less friendly branches of Christianity. I'm not really sure. I follow religious authors and retweet dogmatic messages that I find comforting. I have no problem sharing my religious beliefs with others *in a conversation about religious beliefs*. Maybe the part I find so odious is the perceived lack of contextual appropriateness in such displays – to me, it seems tacky or attention-seeking to force religion into every single situation.I've thought of pursuing a church community that is less "showy" than the ones I find these people in, but I'm stirred. Maybe if I *really* got it, I wouldn't *want* to limit my relationship with God to the private domain. But I think of all the people I've met who are loud Christians first and good people second – or worse, not at all. This may be inconsequential in terms of those individuals' souls, but Christianism without Christlikeness only comes across as hypocritical and harms the cause.Personally, I've always wanted to go out and help the world. I want to be a champion for good, and in doing so, be a champion for God. I would gladly proclaim my faith to anyone who should ask, but I never imagine myself carrying a banner. Better to practice *and then* to preach. Even still, I find context important. Then there are matters of doctrine. It seems silly to me to vehemently argue about the correct number of repetitions of whatever prayer, or papal indulgences or the Trinity or Mary or sainthood or drugs and alcohol or sexual sin and what have you. To me, at the end of the day, none of us is perfect, and condemning each other is the least productive way to spend our time. My rejection of the temptation to "hardline" on these issues is partly a result of the America I've grown up in, and partially due to a personal need to understand and agree with the logic behind something in order to truly identify with it. The problem is that when I question these things, sometimes I catch myself lacking intellectual integrity.For example, I don't consider myself a biblical literalist, at least not by my understanding of the term. For all that I've said about God's plan and our beautiful universe, I just kinda don't buy that the bible is the alpha and the omega when it comes to life and religion. We have to use our intellectual faculties to interpret things that are and aren't relevant. But if I feel I can discount verse X for reason Y, what right do I have to hold onto Romans and John so tightly? This can be especially problematic when I read about anthropology or world religious history. I find it beautiful that there can be so many commonalities to creation myths across cultures. Joseph Campbell's works, to me, indicate yet another beautiful emergent property of this wonderful world. However, my whole religious worldview is *built* on biblical principles. So I feel like I'm putting the cart before the horse when I bring my faith to my readings about the historicity of Jesus or the assembly of the different canons. This is especially troublesome, and leads to seeds of doubts, when I read things that challenge fundamental notions common to all of Christianity. For example the writings of Bart D. Ehrman (which I admit I haven't had the time to read in full and really process) challenge the exaltation of Jesus by the earliest Christians, which gives me the notion that the divinity of Jesus is a somewhat revisionist concept. This isn't an idea that I embrace, having only superficially encountered it, but however absolute my faith, I think it's important that it be grounded in reason where possible.As I've mentioned to a smaller extent, I'm also troubled by the lack of pervasiveness of standard dogmatic Christianity in my life. It certainly contributes to the way I see the world, but sometimes I feel it isn't the center of my life. I pride myself on my reason and skepticism, as all scientists do, but sometimes I feel guilty for identifying so strongly with non-biblical philosophies. As I've said, I find divinity everywhere, so this doesn't really keep me up at night – who really thinks they're living their life wrong?! – but this brings up notions of pantheism, idolatry, animism, or some other paganism, or just a self-centered or human-centered worldview, and I've never heard any of those words used in a nice way on a Sunday morning. Sometimes I worry that I place too much emphasis on love or unity and too little on redemption or fallibility.Finally, I occasionally struggle with my rejection or trivialization of specific dogmatic elements. In particular, the Protestant views of heaven, hell, and Satan just seem a little childish to me. No hell would mean no need for salvation, so that's not really my view, but I embrace the "separation from God" concept over fire and brimstone. Satan, to me, isn't a little goat man, but a personification we use to make the consequences of our own fallibility easier to swallow. Ultimately, I don't think it's very important whether we subscribe to these cartoons so steadfastly, as long as the fundamental substance of Christianity is preserved.I try not to concern myself too heavily with the secondary aspects of Christianity, for fear of diluting the message. I think I'd be most secure with whatever the absolute reductionist, bare-bones version of Christianity is, if I could ever identify it. I just don't know what it is, or if that's okay.
27khr9	-54013	1402170674	AskReddit	Cell phone conversationalists of Reddit: to whom, how often and for how long do you talk on the phone?	In an era dominated by social media and text messaging, the need to actually call and chat on the phone is considerably diminished as compared to pre-iPhone levels. I just talked to my cousin on the phone for two hours, and it was kind of nice. Then my phone died. The other day I spent twenty minutes catching up with an old college friend while I cleaned my living room.Who do you talk on the phone to? Business contacts only? Family? Friends? Old friends? Dates? Roommates? Do you pace while you chat for a couple of hours  while you vent or catch up, or simply take care of business and hang up?
28ylwc	-54013	1403614166	Christianity	Scriptural basis for Christus Victor and other atonement theories?	I'm relatively new to theology, so I apologize if my question is flawed. I know a lot of theological writings are built on the works of other theologians, but I imagine there would be a scriptural basis for the majority of ideas posited, even in an indirect way.So, are the different theories of atonement we read about today founded or influenced by different scriptural passages, or are they generally all just different interpretations of the same passages? I'm most interested in how the different theories differ on a scriptural basis (if indeed they do), and especially Christus Victor in particular, since that's a way of looking at things I never heard about growing up.
293kad	-54013	1403735074	TalesFromYourServer	Had shift in a restaurant today – can you help me with advice about guests, moving up from take-out to server, or general survival?	I just finished my first training shift at "one of the 10 fastest growing restaurants in the U.S. based on year-over-year sales". I had a great time, and really loved meeting my coworkers and staying busy. I had zero restaurant experience before this, and was surprised at how much I enjoyed the work. I loved that there was always something to do, which is a very positive change of pace from my old office or retail jobs. In addition, I learned a lot about the pace of this sort of restaurant and the food itself.I applied as a server, but was told that take-out would be a better place to start so I could learn the menu really well and acclimate myself to the restaurant environment. My manager said that if I do really well at take-out, he'll move me up to server after a couple of months. For my first shift today, I started with a little bit of training for take-out but they had me running food once the lunch rush hit.From then until 3, I was always either bringing food to a guest or asking a coworker what I could do to help them. I once read on this sub that a great attitude to have is "I will never leave the kitchen empty-handed", and I made sure to apply that today.I had a bit of a hard time with the map of the table numbers, but I didn't make any major screwups. I made sure to introduce myself to everyone – servers, hostesses, dishwashers, bussers, cooks – and get to know them a little when time allowed.As far as I can tell, my coworkers were warm to my enthusiasm and eagerness to pitch in make myself useful. My trainer specifically told me that this is a quality that will endear me to my coworkers very quickly. However, I'm somewhat concerned that this attitude could become offputting to my coworkers – I don't want to rub anyone the wrong way or come off as a doormat or suck-up.Besides that, I was a little nervous about the littlest things – the kinds of things that are too little for a trainer to think to point out. This was especially true when interacting with guests. Things like how to hold a plate when you present it to a guest, what to say to guests when I greet them or before I head back to the kitchen, or whether it's appropriate to talk to them at all as a food-runner. I know I'm only training and we learn from mistakes, but I'd rather minimize mistakes when I'm in a position that could harm the restaurant's image.**TL;DR** Does anyone have any advice about these sorts of little things? Or perhaps any more general advice about how to endear myself to my manager and coworkers, become a server, and interact well with guests?

2bc57n	-54013	1405980522	math	A question about sigma notation	I apologize if this is too elementary a question, and will happily repost it elsewhere if necessary. I was going through some old statistics notes and found a pretty lengthy bit that I think could be expressed more simply.What I'm trying to say is Pr[A] = Pr[A|Z]/Pr[Z] + Pr[A|Y]/Pr[Y] + Pr[A|X]/Pr[X] + ...Where A is dependent on [Z, Y, X, W...] and [Z, Y, X, W...] are mutually exclusive events. It seems to me that this might lend itself to sigma notation, which would simplify things a lot. However, since this isn't the simple sort of function I'm used to dealing with, I'm not sure how this would work. Basically the mathematical way of saying"The *probability of A* is equal to the sum of the quotients of the *probabilities of A given (Z, Y, X, W...)* and the *probabilities of (Z, Y, X, W...)*."Is this what a "set" is? Should I define "Z, Y, X, W..." as a "set" and use some symbol to mean that? Is there a standard symbol to use there for this? Am I barking up the wrong tree with this?
2dgoy6	-54013	1407956421	ADHD	A rant on my two selves, and my current inability to resolve them	You know how Dr. Hallowell kind of says ADHD comes with gifts to go with the curse, and points out all these mad successful people with ADHD? And how Dr. Barkley kind of says that those mad successful people with ADHD are outliers just like non-ADHD CEOs and rock stars?I've *always* strived to be an outlier, but right now my life feels like a trial by combat. On one end, my burning inner desire to excel, accomplish, and conquer. His emblem: a red lion, rampant. His champion: my medicated self. On the other end, my id, with its primary function of dopamine-seeking at all costs, family life, self-respect, academics, and achievement notwithstanding. His emblem: an otter, chilling in the river. His champion: my flaky, depressive, unshowered pet man-child.If there's such a thing as a "true self", I'm a blend somewhere between the two extremes. I really do want to be a physician, an educator, a scientist, and a great dad, and to have an Iron Man finisher medal, and money to get my kids great educations. I really do want to ride motorcycles, play guitar on the beach, read, nap, have leisurely brunches, see the world, and have fluency in four languages, knowledge of a hundred hobbies, and thousands of cool stories for my grandchildren.Therein lies the problem: even with medication, I haven't found the right balance where can I grow to become this superperson. Instead, I'm left bouncing between the extremes. I am either:way too hard on myself, dry-mouth, skipping meals, setting superschedules, pathologically analytical, taking on too much commitment, having zero fun, *proactively* punishing myself for ever not being perfect. *or* way too easy on myself, guiltily blowing off item after item on my superschedule, flaking left and right, turning in late homework because duh, Netflix, and self-flagellating when reality bites, *reactively* punishing myself for not being perfect. If I could live out my life as the average of the two, I think I could accomplish my goals. Instead, my medication dictates which person I am for whatever time period, and neither self acts like the other self's friend. I end up wasting way too much time dealing with the fallout. At best, I take three steps forward and one step back. Lately it's been two steps forward and two steps back. I can't just live out my life unmedicated, because my ego will maintain my values (progress, accomplishment, effort) but act counter to them. My coping mechanisms seek to feed my id's dopamine and emotional security, not to consistently pursue accomplishment and healthy self-respect. I just end up hating myself, which leads to more of less. Nothing on that list of dreams above could be accomplished by the person I become when I get into this rut.But I can't literally be medicated 24/7, because I'd never sleep, I'd go crazy from exhaustion, and I'd never see my friends or family. I'd become bitter and evil and repressed, and I'd never play my guitar or appreciate a pancake.I have little interest in taking "days off", because a single unmedicated day tends to throw a wrench in my momentum.There have been good weeks where I've felt I had it figured out, but once my routine is broken even slightly, I fall back into this pattern of self-hating jihad. Has anybody resolved this polarity with some consistency?***tl;dr***  A rant in which I explain how my lofty goals feel basically unachievable as long as I have to exist as either medicated or unmedicated. Wish I could be like 60% medicated, all the time. Right now, I switch between "presidentially diligent" and "oblivious man-child". I spend too much time trying to resolve the two selves to actually pursue any goal with sufficient consistency.Maybe I need better routines or better logistics, but right now I'm just frustrated.

2mzelg	-54013	1416577281	ADHD	Willpower, Meditation and Medication	I've been reading Kelly McGonigal's *The Willpower Instinct*, which is a great read for those of us interested in the neuroscience aspect of our disorder. While it is mainly focused on willpower as it applies to the general American population, every chapter touches on the prefrontal cortex in some way.One of the first things the author emphasizes is that meditation can do more than clear your mind: it can actually strengthen synapses in the prefrontal cortex, making it a lot easier to resist the cheesecake, the urge to read reddit in class, or to sit around dawdling instead of leaving on time for work.Here's the thing: I tried meditating for just five minutes on one of my unmedicated days, and it was HARD. Thoughts flowing in at me like a sandstorm. Then this morning I took my Vyvanse, let it kick in, and tried a five-minute meditation.

It almost feels like cheating.TL;DR Meditation evidently does great things for the prefrontal cortex. My personal experience has shown that (as in everything else) medication makes a night/day difference when you're trying to meditate.

I read the FAQ and used all of the links it provided to try my hand at selecting the best parts for my purposes.I'm ready to move on from my college laptop. One of my roommates in college had a build he called "The Beast", and I remember being so infatuated with it. He had a 1TB HDD and a smaller SSD for booting and his primary applications. The thing would boot in seconds. I would transfer my Civ V saves to it to get a few dozen turns in while he was in class. The difference in performance was just incredible, so now I want one of my own.Gaming is a guilty pleasure of mine, but I try not to play too much. I really only play Civ V, Paradox Games, and Football Manager. I may try out The Sims 4 if I get a machine that can handle it. Beyond that it's pretty much just Office, iTunes, and web browsing for me. I do have a pretty extensive music library.My budget was, initially, $500.

2yjftr	-54013	1425976926	ADHD	I have an appointment with a cardiologist tomorrow morning.	I recently passed the one-year mark of my life post-diagnosis, and it's really incredible how far I've come since then. I went from nearly failing out of university to getting a 3.7 in my final semester. I've grown more as a person this past year than I ever thought I could with or without meds. I've learned so much about how my brain works and how I fit into the world. Best of all, I've learned that there is hope for me, and that I really can achieve all of those lofty goals that always seemed out of reach.The trouble came when I switched primary care doctors last month. I mentioned during my physical that I've had chest pains off and on since I was 18. Never severe and never long-lived, but always severe and long enough to make me stop what I'm doing and say "ow."Of course my doctor wanted to get an EKG, and of course the EKG came back abnormal.After weeks of battling with my insurance company to find a cardiologist I can see, I decided to pay out-of-pocket to see the one I was referred to. My appointment is in 7 hours.I'm so nervous. The last two weeks, I've set my life on hold. It's amazing, after living medicated for months, just how it feels to be unmedicated for two weeks at a time. Back to my man-child existence of Netflix, sugar, sex, and all the other cheap dopamine I could find. No more MCAT studying or exercising or financial responsibility. No more sustained effort toward my ultimate goals. No more delayed gratification or really anything I can get away with not doing. Just the couch.Tomorrow, God willing, the cardiologist will clear me for medication again. If not, I don't know what I'll do.Pray for me.

3cps14	-54013	1436472768	ADHD	As a young, single, male with ADHD and lofty goals, what role should sex play in my life?	Basically, I'm feeling quite conflicted when it comes to sex.A year and a half ago, I found out I have ADHD, and it was really cathartic. Suddenly it felt like I had a path to get around the obstacles to all my goals (mostly medical school, but also a handful of other lofty long-term goals). Trouble is, after limiting some of my less productive dopamine-seeking behaviors (mostly video games, television and mindless web use), I found myself increasingly using sex to replace the dopamine rush. It got to the point where it became a huge distraction; it almost felt like an addiction. I'd have three or four girls on call for guaranteed 24/7 coverage in the event that I wanted to have sex, and then another handful who I was working up to that point with. Honestly, in terms of time management, the sex was less problematic than maintaining the network of contacts so I could reliably get it when I wanted it.Over a couple of months this stopped feeling fun and started feeling meaningless, shameful, and icky. Like, these are other humans with ideas and goals, and despite my better intentions, we were reducing each other to pretty meat. In the somewhat distant future I'd like to have an awesome marriage with a woman I value as a whole person, where we share everything. Sometimes I feel like my recent participation in the whole millennial-promiscuity-culture will be harmful to that. In keeping with this thinking, I decided I'm better off putting that time toward my educational, financial, and personal goals. Eight weeks ago I decided to become totally celibate, cut off all my relevant contacts, and get shit done. That's largely been successful.The trouble is I *really* like sex.Last night I went out to a bar with a couple of friends (for the first time in what feels like forever) and a pretty girl started chatting me up. Immediately, it felt like all the reasons I've had for committing to celibacy the past eight weeks flew out the window. All I wanted was to go home with this for a quick, fun, meaningless night together. Luckily, I have good friends I've confided in about this issue who helped hold me back.I've had these on-off cycles with sex before, and it seems like every time I get straightened out, one little slip-up turns into a months-long sex bender where I neglect my personal development in favor of easy dopamine.I'm at the point where I don't even know how I feel about sex. Is it a nice thing two people who love each other should share? Is it merely a fun thing for any two consenting adults?

3cpvph	-54013	1436474310	DecidingToBeBetter	As a young, single, male with ADHD and lofty goals, what role should sex play in my life? [x-post from r/ADHD]	Basically, I'm feeling quite conflicted when it comes to sex.A year and a half ago, I found out I have ADHD, and it was really cathartic. Suddenly it felt like I had a path to get around the obstacles to all my goals (mostly medical school, but also a handful of other lofty long-term goals). Trouble is, after limiting some of my less productive dopamine-seeking behaviors (mostly video games, television and mindless web use), I found myself increasingly using sex to replace the dopamine rush. It got to the point where it became a huge distraction; it almost felt like an addiction. I'd have three or four girls on call for guaranteed 24/7 coverage in the event that I wanted to have sex, and then another handful who I was working up to that point with. Honestly, in terms of time management, the sex was less problematic than maintaining the network of contacts so I could reliably get it when I wanted it.Over a couple of months this stopped feeling fun and started feeling meaningless, shameful, and icky. Like, these are other humans with ideas and goals, and despite my better intentions, we were reducing each other to pretty meat. In the somewhat distant future I'd like to have an awesome marriage with a woman I value as a whole person, where we share everything. Sometimes I feel like my recent participation in the whole millennial-promiscuity-culture will be harmful to that. In keeping with this thinking, I decided I'm better off putting that time toward my educational, financial, and personal goals. Eight weeks ago I decided to become totally celibate, cut off all my relevant contacts, and get shit done. That's largely been successful.The trouble is I *really* like sex.Last night I went out to a bar with a couple of friends (for the first time in what feels like forever) and a pretty girl started chatting me up. Immediately, it felt like all the reasons I've had for committing to celibacy the past eight weeks flew out the window. All I wanted was to go home with this for a quick, fun, meaningless night together. Luckily, I have good friends I've confided in about this issue who helped hold me back.I've had these on-off cycles with sex before, and it seems like every time I get straightened out, one little slip-up turns into a months-long sex bender where I neglect my personal development in favor of easy dopamine.I'm at the point where I don't even know how I feel about sex.

I am inexperienced with other women besides a quick peck on the lips, so I'm not looking for a sex partner. My current situation:I am in a relationship with a 21 year old male, but he is one hundred percent supportive of me and my sexuality. I'd like to get that out of the way because I don't want to lead anyone on. Which means, YES I am allowed to explore my sexuality without it being cheating. He (and I too) prefer that I: Tell him and have both parties get an STI test (if/when it leads to anything sexual)Something that'll make me feel a bit more comfortable too is if he meets my new female friends. There's a couple of reasons for this.The first being that I unfortunately still live at home, am in the closet, and my family is overly protective since I am an only child. So in a strange way, my boyfriend is my "cover" to go out and meet other women. (teehehe) The second is I'd rather it feel like to everyone involved that I'm having a girls day than me going off with random girls doing "God" knows what. Seems pretty fair right....? (I hope, I'm trying not to make this too long. so SORRY!)Okay so now that all that is out of the way. I'm sorry this is so complicated. Here's a little about me! My name is Ashley.

My SO is an amazing guy, and we haven't even had our first serious/big fight. My family likes and trusts him. BUT I'm not allowed to sleep over at his place. They also think that just because I live with them means it's **not okay** to stay the night at my his place. I've tried asking them to start treating me like an adult and let me but... They think I'll make the same mistakes they did. But I won't because I've watched them fuck up and/or heard stories and I know I don't want that... I don't want kids young like them or to be married young. Hell I MIGHT get married when I'm 25 but that's if I'm 1000% sure. It's so frustrating and it makes me want to move in with him ASAP so I can do whatever I want. I don't party and do drugsDon't stay out super late, even though I could**DO** go to work regularly and work hardso all in all I just wish things were different. Especially since my SO is my best friend ughh

I am bisexual (I've known since I was in middle school), I'm interested in  having an open relationship with another woman. I'm inexperienced so I'm sorry in advanced if I'm really nervous and shy.

Last week I was on a steady rise from 3.2k to 3.5k now im back down to 3.1k because I keep getting 2 vs 5 matchups. By 2 vs 5 I mean the matchmaker keeps giving me 3 absolute cretin spastics and only 1 good allie for the last 12 matches or so while the enemy gets 5 competent players. The 3 spastics feed all game long and there's nothing me and the other guy can do. The 3 idiots also pick heros that the enemy has a few hard counters for (picked before they did). To make matters worse the feeding bastard in my last match who was 0-17 in 20 mins got a mythical set drop. Am I in some sort of shadow pool where Valve purposely fucks me over for reasons unseen? I'm tempted to sell up all my items and uninstall the game. I just can't seem to get a fair balanced match anymore. It's just not fun.

Firstly it was controlled by LeapMotion. Jury considered this app perspective and gave us an award. But since we didnt have own LeapMotion, as hackathon had ended we change platform to Android and controls to accelerometer to finish this app and share it. It's our first attempt to publish our app on Google Play.It was a great experience, especially localization since we had never encountered it before.Feel free to ask any question and test the game.

It is a 3D drag racing, but not just a boring driving in a straight line. I find it more like good old NFS Underground, exactly a drag race from that game. There are lots of obstacles and heavy traffic on the roads. So you have to not only shift gears in time, but also be really careful with another cars. The controls are pretty easy: tilt the device to steer and press the button to shift gears.I am as the coder want to hear your opinions on game's UI and overall visual appearance, since the visual design isn't my strongest field.Here is the [imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/gBRwW) with short story of development in screenshots.Right now the 1st part of huge optimization update gonna hit Google Play.

I wanted some advice on putting together the flood and drain plumbing. I've been reading a lot about timers for pumps and bell/loop siphons.I'd like to use a siphon (not sure which type yet). I've ready many articles and blog posts, but I'm not sure whether I would also need to time my pump (15 min out of every hour) or if I should use it continuously. Can someone explain the correct way to set up a flood and drain system?I've got a grow bed that measures 2'x6'x10" about 3 feet above (4 ft head) a 55 gallon fish tank.I've read that you need to pump the volume of your tank every hour. I think I need a pump capable of pumping at least 60GPH at 4' (if I am to use the pump continuously).  If I only use the pump 15 minutes out of every hour, my understanding is that I need a pump capable of pumping 240GPH at 4'.For clarity, am I understanding the calculation correctly?Any recommendation on hose size? I'm thinking half-inch should be sufficient.Thanks for helping me dive into an exciting new experience!
1biryk	-54081	1364918217	aquaponics	Loop Siphon floating up with grow media	Hello,I'm building my first aquaponics system and I decided to go with a loop siphon (as opposed to a bell).  I've gotten the system built completely and am currently in the testing phase where I make sure it floods and drains properly.I'm having a lot of problems with this stage, primarily because the hose I'm using as a siphon floats up with my clay pebble grow media and the siphon never activates. I want to weigh the hose down, but need to use something food-safe.  I was thinking about finding some heavy stones and boiling them, then using silicone caulk to glue them to the siphon hose.  Do you have any suggestions on a better way to hold the hose down? I can't tie or staple it down, because I use a pond liner to contain the grow bed.Thanks for your guidance r/aquaponics!

1cnbch	-54086	1366333135	tifu	TIFU by accidentally starting a fire in my high school chemistry lab	So at the moment in my high school chem class. We were given a lab where we were to mix lead nitrate and potassium iodide, or something to that effect. So it all goes well till we have to dry our solid, which is on filter paper. My chem teacher told us that we could use one of the two microwaves in the room, but be careful how long we put it in for.This goes against every natural instinct I have of using the mystical microwave. "No metal in there" my mom would say when i would try to nuke my spoon with my instant oats.But I'm like, he's the teacher, and throw that yellow bastard child of lead and iodine in the shitty, 80s-era microwave. As soon as I shut the door, the square button you push to shut it fell off.There's my fucking black cat. Shoulda walked away right there after that omen. But as the oblivious bastard I am, I shove it back on and set the timer for one minute. I proceeded to BS with my lab partner till i heard peculiar clicks. I turn to watch the lead iodide sparking like hell, then a slight "woosh".Fire began to consume the filter paper like a fat kid eating steak at Golden Corral. By now a smell not unlike burnt marshmallows mixed with burning plastic has filled the lab. I rushed to hit the 'open' button to and this ugly display of my own ineptitude. Alas, it and the "end" button were broken. Thankfully the power plug was nearby and was pulled.Slowly the acrid steam began to stream out of the microwave, stopped only as my chem teacher threw a beaker upside down over what was now a black crater in the microwave.The fire gone, he looked at me with the biggest "what the fuck retard" look. Mind you I am in an honors class. Luckily I don't think I will be in any real trouble.TL;DR: I set fire to the microwave, watched it burned as i smelled the rays.Or something to that effect. Sorry if this is shitty quality, I'm on mobile.

It had very little effect on the wobble I felt, and today when I got my car to 60 mph, the whole car shook violently.I am confused as it's not a damaged wheel or tire, because I and a mechanic inspected them. What could be the problem? any and all help would be greatly appreciated
24bihq	-54086	1398812467	Cartalk	Possible strut mount broke or loose? '05 Scion tC 2.4L 56k miles	Recently my car has been making an odd noise, best described as a clanging, when the front passenger tire passes over a bump. I also am getting vibrations at highway speeds akin to that of a wheel balance issue, despite them being balanced very recently. I looked at my front passenger suspension components and everything seems to be in order. No leaking ball joints, cv joints, control arm looks fine, all bolts are tight. Strut is fine as well, as I am getting none of the symptoms of a broken one. Even did the "push down on fender" test and it did not bounce.My best guess is strut mount. Any/all help is appreciated. Thanks!

When is a certain media outlet too big to fully trust, and vice versa, when is a certain media outlet too small to trust?	Hey everyone. This has been something that is constantly crossing my mind as of late. There are so many news and media sources in the world with the internet and many other ways of sharing. So many of them are large multi-million dollar enterprises, others are small blogs that have grown and developed over time. A coexisting feature of these is that when they all put out coverage on the same event, it is all in a different voice and a different perspective. Certain of these may find ease putting in their own stretch of the truth. When do you draw the line of a group knowing too much, or not enough? When a company is too big too fully trust what is being said. Or not big enough to have enough information? I feel that when bigger companies make ties and lots of money is involved the news can be shanked into different directions. But the same goes for an attention-hungry smaller outlet looking for its time of day. I don't really expect a full on answer to this obviously, but what are you guys' opinions on this?

1myg8u	-54104	1379942009	breakingbad	(Spoilers) The purpose of the Grey Matter interview. 5:15 "Granite State"	I see a lot of people thinking that Walt is going to poison Elliot and Gretchen after what they said about Walt in the interview, how all he contributed was the company name. I think the main purpose of this was to show the ultimate parallel. It showed both of the fields in Walts life where he had an exceptional talent and his success is taken away from him. It shows that even though Elliot knows Walt did more than that, he is looking out for his own self-interest for overall success of his company. Gretchen promptly answers he isn't alive as Walter White because of the last interaction she had with him. That was not the same Walt who she worked with in their younger days. It showed Walt that Jesse was cooking and is still being held by the Nazis. He knows that Lydia is buying and selling his product because it is in Europe. Sure Walt is angry about what Elliot says and I don't think that was the last time we will see the two, but he has already accepted he isn't going to get the credit he deserves in Grey Matter. When he was talking to Jesse in his house and telling him how he sold his share in Grey Matter for $5k, he said all he has now is the Heisenberg Empire. I think that interview sparked the classing nerves of Walt getting angry at not getting credit for his work, and this will lead to a fierce confrontation with Walt and Jesse next episode. **TL;DR - Seeing that interview was super important. It shows Elliot and Gretchen's fear and self-interest, and it tells Walt that even after a month Jesse is still with the Nazis cooking and Lydia is buying and selling it. How will this play into Episode 16?****What do you think seeing the interview means for Walt?**

"Pilot"	Finally, I got my girlfriend to fall into my trap and watch Breaking Bad in its entirety with me. I watched the show from start to finish (with a notably large gap between watching season 2 when it aired and then catching up to watch 5A). Now knowing the outcome and all the parallels I noticed from newer episodes to to older ones, it is time for me to do a deeper look at it episode by episode, see what I missed, what you guys think I missed, and everything above and beyond that. So here we go!"**PILOT**"* Wow, looking back at it now after so long from watching it, what a beautiful episode. You get a perfect balance of being thrown right into the madness unbeknownst to you, and a solid introduction of who everyone is and where they start.* I always wonder why Walt was such a bad liar, he can't even tell his wife straight up that he passed out at work. I can understand not wanting to break the news of cancer to her, especially when Sky gets angry at him for spending $15 at Staples on printer paper.* Also, maybe Walt should have took note of how he used a dolly when he was bringing the barrel out right before he passed out at the carwash when he was stealing the Methylamine.* Thank you Hank. If it wasn't for you, Walt would never have even had an interest in Meth, let alone forming into Heisenberg.* One of the biggest drastic changes I found even watching the first episode is how much more comedic the first season is. "How does it feel to be old?" - "How does it feel to be a smart ass?" "Fuck you, fuck you and your eyebrows!" Some killer comedy lines in here. Honestly I think when Saul comes in he single handedly takes all the comedy in the show for himself.* There is a lot of talk on this sub about when Walt officially "Breaks Bad." For me, I think it is in this very episode. The scene when Jr. is getting new Jeans and is being made fun of by the jock in the distance. Walt walks out the back door and comes in the front, immediately taking this son of a bitch down.* Jesse is my favorite Breaking Bad character, period. He portrays a perfect modern day person his age who would be in that situation. Everything about him is so real. How nervous he gets when Walt shows up at his house. How offended he gets when Walt says the meth he makes is shit. Also how obscure he thinks it is that an older man is stepping into a younger mans game. * Walt says that he would turn Jesse in if he refused to cook for him. I think that was all talk though, that would put Walt in too much of a risky spot for a Chemistry teacher to unearth that a former student (who the DEA couldn't even figure out was behind it) was a meth Kingpin. Just pointing that out. What if Jesse had said no? I would have said no if some geezer came and practically tried to force me to partner with him.* By the time that Walt busts out the Red Phosphorus he has already broke bad, that was not the beginning. Immediately we see how quickly Walt is to think on his toes which is an extreme part of the show.* Krazy-8's house is awfully nice, so is his car. The fact that no one was suspicious of that is beyond me. How he didn't get questioned right when his cousin was arrested is also interesting.* Since we know how Jesse actually got the RV, it's pretty funny to think of the space in between when Walt gave Jesse the money and the time we first see the RV.* It's pretty fantastic to see how quickly the relationship between Walt and Jesse develops. Granted Walt is a genius, he could have just left Jesse after Krazy and his Cousin kicked the shit out of him. Walt trusts Jesse with the RV money, It's like a cute little Teacher/Student relationship reborn. He even talks to Jesse like he is still in a classroom with him.* Poor Walt Jr. I'm sorry you had to listen to Walt bang your mom so hard that night. * I can't pick them out word for word right now (I watched it last night and am writing this afternoon) but there are a LOT of quotes from Walt to Hank and Sky implying that Walt wants to be up to something. Is it that easy to ask a DEA agent to be shown a place that got busted literally minutes ago? Walt seems like a drone until he starts questioning the big 700k meth bust Hank did, and then all of a sudden grows a huge interest. That would be fishy to most family members, but why would someone so innocent want to fall into something so deep.* Walt gazing into his Nobel credit prize kind of ties up the series almost for me. Longing for what could-would have been. Little did he know what was going to come from this all. The money Krazy-8 gave him seemed ultra realistic to him at the time, but starting with that is just bumping up and up his expectations. He could have been a billionaire, he secretly is striving for that and it doesn't take long for these thoughts to escalate into a reality.___________________________________________________________My reason for doing this is that I want to brew up deeper and deeper thoughts on what little events will entail in the future of Walt, and all the other characters. Discuss away, critique my analysis, ask questions. We are all here to dig deeper that what is simply on the surface. Thanks BrBa for changing my outlook on what is possible for a TV show to do, and how much emotion the whole crew brought out of millions of fans.

1pm0mf	-54104	1383224354	breakingbad	*PatataSalad's Re-Breaking Bad Analysis* discussing "The Cat's in the Bag.."	Here we go, episode two. Crazy stuff actually goes down here too. I remember watching the show initially and thinking it took until around season 2ish/3 to really get going. Subtly it really gets spicy from the get go.* Walt destroys the memory card on the video camera from the film of himself he made thinking the beginning was already the end of the line for him. That is the first of many things to be snapped and destroyed to get rid of the data!* Along with this comes the first ROYAL mistake they make. They are both smart guys, I wonder what happened in their heads that made them forget the gas mask lying on the ground. Maybe the thrill of what was going on overwhelmed them and kept them from thinking of the obvious? Regardless that comes to bite them in the ass almost (If it wasn't for those meddling kids!)* Walt can’t even lie to a damn tow truck driver. You think the guy would notice a funky smell and bullet holes in the thing, and especially be concerned about the soaking wet money.* Comedy is still extremely present too. Things aren’t ultra-serious yet. “I’m Skyler White yo.” That whole scene where Sky shows up at Jesse’s house is probably the only successful lie Walt ever told her, and it works out perfectly in each of their favors. Jesse is a little naive at first about it, though. * Walt is not ready for the reality of the situation he is in with having a hostage. He is scared to even hear Krazy-8’s voice when he goes down with the bag to kill him. You can visually see him feeling extreme guilt which is something that constantly pops up for him. * It personally agitates me that when Sky and Walt are in an intense situation she has to in a way guilt trip him, in regards to when they find out they are having a girl and she thinks that is a perfect opportunity to ask about Jesse.* Skyler digs deeper than she needs to. Curiosity is flooding her mind, she doesn’t even know Walt has cancer. She is poking her nose in the wrong territory by looking up who Jesse is.* This episode is directed by Adam Bernstein, who also directs the following episode “And The Bag Is In The River…” He also directs “Mandala” “ABQ” “Caballo Sin Nombre” “Half Measures” “Box Cutter” and “Hazard Pay.” All of these episodes are really deep and dark, and this one is no different. * Jesse is beginning to realize that he should listen to things that Walt advises him to do. When he tries to destroy Emilio’s body in the bathtub and it comes crashing through it, he has a face of pure regret.* This episode is also the first time we see Jesse actually smoking meth. We are shown a new side of him that acts on impulse, rather than reason. He is in a panic and needs to get rid of the body but can’t wait to do it properly. At first Jesse tries to be like a teacher to Walt when it comes to the meth game, but he quickly learns there is a lot more than just cred and experience involved.* Also, if you are wondering how Sky figured out where Jesse lives, his address is shown on the site that has his profile on it.* I forget what the exact quote is, but Walt and Jesse are having an extremely serious conversation and he slowly says “I think, our best course of action, would be to ___.” Sort of a nod to when he was having the incredibly serious and renowned conversation about “treading lightly.” * One of my favorite montages in the show is when Walt is trying to roll a joint. On the recurring theme of comedy I have been talking about this is top notch. It’s hilarious to see Jesse walk in to the room to his former Teacher, now meth partner smoking a joint. Granted cooking meth is a far bigger issue than smoking pot, Walt never actually DOES meth, and him smoking weed is showing even further how much this business changes him drastically. He is doing things he would never have done initially. Walt already broke bad, he just is digging deeper and deeper. * The whole scene of Jesse talking to himself while disposing of Emilio and the gun is awfully childish. Jesse is still really into his own ideas. He thinks that virtually anything he does is “the bomb.” His Chilli P meth, how he critiques Walt when starting the RV.* Walt is getting sicker and sicker, Sleeping on the bathroom floor naked, the cough is starting to really draw attention to him. Everyone gives him a funny look as he coughs and it makes me feel like people understand that this isn’t just your average sickness.* Although I say how things that Jesse does is childish, he is awfully good at thinking on his toes. When he grabs the bike lock of the motorcycle in the garage and tests it on himself before putting it on Krazy is really smart.* The soundtrack in this episode is phenomenal. That is constant throughout the show for me. There is a great spotify playlist with all the music, I’ll link later. But the song playing while Jesse goes to get the bike lock is actually called “The Bike Lock” by Dave Porter. Also the song playing while Walt smokes is called “Nine Years” by Ticklah, it is hilarious.

1r253h	-54104	1384956969	pokemon	Looking for a good deal on a DS for the new Pokemon games. (Sorry if this isn't the best place for this!)	Hello! Old school pokemoner here. Took a break after beating Pearl and haven't came back since (I still mess around with my old copies now and again). I played a friend of mines copy of X the other day and I was kind of blown away by all the progression the game has made! I've been lurking this sub but not really posting because I haven't had a reason to with lack of game and kind of being in a tight financial spot. I think I am getting close to being ready to join all of you though! After stopping my DS run, I have since turned it in with a lot of my games due to needed money, but I am looking to get my hands on a system to play it with, used, refurbished, new whatever. I am just looking for something I can get for not a huge amount of money so I can get my adventure on. If any of you have a suggestion where I could get the system and game for a reasonable deal that would be much appreciated. If you have an old DS that you want to get rid of as well I would gladly buy on from you fine redditors. Any sort of help would be appreciated, thank you!!**TL;DR - I sold my DS long ago in a money crisis, I want to start again and play X/Y but I need a DS, HALP.**

1shcoh	-54104	1386615736	pokemon	Searched, looked in other subs/sites, still have a few questions about competitive play/"regionals."	Heya guys I haven't posted too much here. I just got my 3DS and Y on the 29th of November and am about to slaughter the Elite Four. I am mainly looking to be playing competitively post game but I have a few questions before hand.* With this whole cross game banking thing, is there going to be some sort of rules against which pokemon you can/can't use (i.e. only pokemon caught in X/Y or something of the sort) or is that a stupid question?* What's all this talk about a competitive season/regionals? I kind of get the gist of it, but is it going to be online play or will I have to go somewhere on a certain day and play? Maybe another stupid question but I can't get on a lot of sites from where I currently am so am only getting a small block of information.* Lastly, if I am looking to play X/Y competitively, would you recommend getting B/B2 - W/W2 and HG/SS to increase my possible teams?Thanks in advance for any help.

Personally I think running mold breaker and having Earthquake in the moveset would be a beneficial counter to a lot of frequently used pokes, but personally I use certain berries that I would be screwed without (Passho on Arcanine). I'm not really interested in Rivalry right now, just looking between the two mentioned in the title. I have a good understanding of the pros and cons of both, but what do you all think? If you're wondering the rest of the team I would be pairing it with is  Trick Room Slowbro, Baron Pass Togekiss, Arcanine, Prankster Sableye, and Mega Manetric.

1wdp8v	-54104	1390927198	stunfisk	[Question] Looking for a little help with picking a Fire type.	So the ones so far I think would be good on my team are Prankster Sableye with Taunt, Will-o-wisp, Foul Play, Recover. Poison Point  Stealth Rock Toxic Spikes Earthquake Protect Nidoqueen, Rocky Helmet Blissey Wall Of Death and Intimidate Mega-Mawile. I was originally going to run an Arcanine with this but I am now second guessing. Fire types are one of my personal favorites, but I am having trouble picking one.I was thinking Volcarona would be good with its access to Quiver Dance and it's typing My only worry is its huge weakness to stealth rock. Also looking at Emboar, between it's really good base stats, and running Reckless with Flare Blitz seems pretty affective, maybe holding a Passho Berry would prove to be beneficial to it. With having I could also use pointers on my 6th poke as well.Any sort of pointers on Fire types that you have used would be helpful, long time pokemon player and just this gen getting to competitive play.

1yaobb	-54104	1392771772	ShinyPokemon	Anyone interested in the Shiny Palkia from the event? I'm looking for some dex entries for my shiny charm!	Such as said in the post. I am at like 387 in the national dex right now so I need a lot, if anyone wants to do some tradebacks I would be more than appreciative! If you would like, I'd appreciate a shiny for the Palkia, but I'd also take some competitive ready pokemon or a pokemon ready to breed.
1ye3cb	-54104	1392854176	friendsafari	LF: Chansey, Nuzleaf, Throh, Maractus, Gastrodon and Excadrill. Will add all! (Also looking for National Dex help :D!)	Title says it all, I have the 'swine. I am also looking for help filling my national dex so if anyone feels so inclined to help me it would be much obliged and I can gift a few 5IV's for your help, all dex entries would just be tradeback anyhow. If you want to help, PM me and I can show you what I am missing! I have 401/718, missing 317/718

1ysl91	-54104	1393249636	stunfisk	A team with two of the same abilities.	Greetings Stunfisk, lurker, not much of a poster but here goes nothing.I have been breeding and training a bunch of different pokemon to have ready so I can make an assortment of teams. A couple of the pokemon I bred that I think I would like to use on the same team are Sableye and Whimsicott. Here is how I am building them.Whimsicott. Bold @Leftovers. Prankster (252HP 252Def 4Sp.D)* Leech Seed* Encore* Stun Spore* Moonblast Sableye. Calm @Leftovers. Prankster (Honestly can't remember my invested EV's but its a pretty standard Sableye set)* Recover* Will-O-Wisp* Foul Play* TauntEach of these absolutely have their own unique, annoying traits. Between STAB foul play, will-o-wisp and taunt, Sableye serves as a perfect stall and force switcher, who also has the ability to hit like a truck when needed. Also with its typing it leaves not a lot that can hurt it before a switch is pulled or they get seriously injured.Whimsicott on the other hand is just pure annoyance. Depending who I face I can either initiate with a Leech or Encore (hoping they do a boost) and set in a paralyze so they miss their second attack. Moonblast for the kill, encore, repeat. Whimsicott having got fairy type in gen 6 makes it so much more viable it's incredible.Chances are I would only run these two together in singles, but if I were to play doubles I wouldn't run them next to eachother. Anyone got experience running two of the same natures on a team? If you have any questions, comments or concerns about these two sets I'd love to discuss. I bet some of you have some interesting takes on both of these characters.

We're looking to give players the opportunity to connect with master league coaches that can dramatically improve your SC2 play, and we'd love to hear feedback from the Starcraft community before we get started! Specifically, we're interested in how much players would be willing to pay per hour for 1-on-1 play time with the top 2% of the SC2 community. These lessons will include replay macro &amp; micro analysis, 1v1 player versus coach sessions, homework, etc. Thanks in advance to anyone who helps our research with constructive responses :).

3ga32u	-54112	1439066422	starcraft	A Quick Fix and Fresh Air to HoTS Zerg	Merge the 2 Hydralisk upgrades into 1, like how it is in LotV beta currently. This LotV Hydra buff is neither game changing nor marketable as a new "LotV addition." The perfect candidate to slap into HoTS last minute.Hydralisks have such a better place in LotV for the following reasons:**ZvP:** Hydra/Ling attacks force the Protoss to choose a tech branch, Collo/Archons/Storms/Something other than blink stalker. The nerf to SH has allowed protoss to sit on Blinker Stalkers-only tech for too long.  The offensive hydralisk allows a zerg to pressure, rather than all-or-nothing attacks like we're seeing now; there's no retreat so you have to.**ZvT**   Hydralisks can be a great counter attack or side flank unit against a number of mech armies; liberators specifically, but even HoTS mech I could see it used vs. the more medivac-heavy or banshee mech styles.Or it may help Zergs by naturally spreading their army, having various ranged attacks sooner.**ZvZ:** Roach Hydra pushes could be more doable, maybe putting a timer on the current mass roach meta? These days particularly, you rarely see RH work until you reach high army values. With the quicker movement speed, offense in general and splitting vs. no Bling speed Banelings will be easier. So if your opponent isn't scouting, maybe stuck on mass roach, he/she can't last-minute morph some Banelings and hold handily.This is a quick fix on a game we all know Blizzard isn't investing additional hours into, and I think it'll be the perfect touch Zerg needs to shake the current meta.Thanks for reading,SirRobin

19m88g	-54124	1362368515	TrueAtheism	Not sure if this is the right place, but I think it fits.  The dismissal of evidence from religious people what makes me feel more and more comfortable in being away from the religious.	I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/191xdq/report_pope_resigned_in_wake_of_gay_priest_scandal/) to /r/Christianity when it was just speculation with adherence to proof.  It was very quickly dismissed (without proof) and downvoted (please dont upvote it, its at 10dv-5uv).  Im not mad at all about that, Im frustrated with the ideology of those people.  I cant grasp my head around what is going on in those peoples heads, if I had something bad in my organization I would try my absolute hardest to make it stop.  I understand that there will always be 'gossip' like one person pointed out, but I never thought about it like that, especially a police investigation.  The post shows the layout of what has unfolded in the last week or so of Cardinal Keith O'Brien admitting to what he did.  Now I understand attacking the faith is something we should all try to avoid, as its making fun of what people choose to believe in.  I feel the actual organization is a whole different thing.  I dont feel as the organization should have the *special* aura surrounding it like religion? Does that make sense, sorry Im writing this and while studying.Why are some within religion so quick to dismiss evidence against their organization?  I understand being loyal, but Im at a loss for words sometimes.  That dossier was delivered to The Popes desk back on December 17th.  I want to know what the rest of this document entails.  Will more stuff come to light that the public is still unaware of?  If you have any information please post it, I want to read more on this subject.What are you thoughts about the organization itself?  Thoughts, where should we draw the line to scrutinizing the church itself (not religion)?Im sorry if this is a mess of thoughts and words, Im having trouble conveying my thoughts currently while trying to study.  Discuss.

I have heard stories of people getting shotguns pointed at them once it went under new ownership a few years ago.I have also heard people dont patrol the place you jump, they only patrol the place you park, so you will be fine as long as you have a driver to drop you off and pick you up.Thoughts?  Where can you jump off cliffs? Please dont respond back with Cascades or something.  Im willing to drive within like 2 or so hours rom Blacksburg.

237z27	-54124	1397688191	VirginiaTech	To the Blue Mountain State Fans, Why BMS is based on Virginia Tech. Also there is a BMS Contest (link inside)	Why Blue Mountain State is based on Virginia Tech.* Coach Marty Daniels states that "He is going after Joe Pa's record as he was next in line"  Hes Beamer.* Blue Mountain State somehow always seems to get a better bowl game then they deserve, then Marty Daniels comes out and hardcore denies the naysayers that they 100% deserve their bowl game.  Sound familiar? Beamer did that exact same thing.  Sounds identical to our last Sugar Bowl year...  Funny enough that episode was at the end of the second season, it premiered 3 months after our game.  And the best part, what city did BMS go to for this bowl game? NEW ORLEANS.* I dont remember the exact episode but its strikingly similar the endorsement deal Marty Daniels did with their local gas station to the one Beamer has done.* Blue Mountain State... What mountains are they talking about?  BMS is an East coast school as they mentioned they had to fly to the West coast for a game.  What mountain range could they be talking about?  Appalachian mountain with our Blue Ridges.  What is the top and best school in that mountain chain? Virginia Tech.* We know BMS is a state public school.  If you watch the BMS recruiting video, their main slogan is "What is BMS? - (every student responds) I AM"  **What is a Hokie? I AM**And my personal favorite...* The Kicker has a drug problem, this one speaks for itself....This is just a fun list that I put together, add some more and Ill add it to the list.  That is not the main reason for my post though.  Blue Mountain State wants to make a movie, they have a Kickstarter set up and are trying to make it happen.  Well I felt that it was only appropriate that the BMS cast all came here to privately showcase the movie, at the *real* Blue Mountain State.  Well they are doing this.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/773106364/blue-mountain-state-the-movie/posts/811504They are having a college competition for whichever college can raise the most money for the movie.  I say we set something up, to make this happen for Virginia Tech.I will need help trying to do that, as Im not even sure how to start, but I thought it was an awesome idea and I will need all the help I can get.  I personally think a Frat needs to sponsor this, because you know *The Goat House*.  I would love it if Hokie House (as a play on words of Goat House) would be on board (where the after party serving Mojitos could take place, even though currently they dont serve mojitos, maybe for one night though?)  But I dont know how to even go about doing that.If we could get Beamer in recruitment video for this, or some football plays to act like some BMS players, Honestly I dont think it would be a hard sell to the Virginia Tech community.What do you think?
247muj	-54124	1398713783	CFB	What college is the show Blue Mountain State really about? Virginia Tech in my mind is the clear frontrunner for the show.	Why Blue Mountain State is based on Virginia Tech.Coach Marty Daniels states that "He is going after Joe Pa's record as he was the second winningest coach" Hes Beamer.Blue Mountain State somehow always seems to get a better bowl game then they deserve, then Marty Daniels comes out and hardcore denies the naysayers that they 100% deserve their bowl game. Sound familiar? Beamer did that exact same thing. Sounds identical to our last Sugar Bowl year... Funny enough that episode was at the end of the second season, it premiered 3 months after VT bowl game. And the best part, what city did BMS go to for this bowl game? NEW ORLEANS.I dont remember the exact episode but its strikingly similar the endorsement deal Marty Daniels did with their local gas station to the one Beamer has done. (even though many coaches have done this)Blue Mountain State... What mountains are they talking about? BMS is an East coast school as they mentioned they had to fly to the West coast for a game. What mountain range could they be talking about? Appalachian mountain with our Blue Ridges. What is the top football program and one of the best academic schools in that mountain chain? Virginia Tech.We know BMS is a public state school. If you watch the BMS recruiting video, their main slogan is "What is BMS? - (every student responds) I AM" What is a Hokie? I AMAnd my personal favorite... The Kicker has a drug problem, This is a reference to Cody Journell.This is just a fun list that I put together, its not meant to be very serious so please dont take it that way.  Its not meant to spark anger in anyone or anything, but if you think the show in question is based on Boise, WVU, or *fill in your school*.  Please tell me why!  I know this show is not based off of *one* university and it is based off of many, but I had fun putting this list together.

24vwsn	-54124	1399402537	Coffee	Hey guys! Not sure where to turn, but we have this antique coffee maker and Im looking for information on it. Google had not been any help.	http://imgur.com/SQjiETUA little backstory - It has been sitting in my grandmothers basement kitchen for since 1960, and it has all parts attached (so my gandmother tells me).  She said she didnt ever have it working and bought it for a decorative piece, but was told she could hook it up if she wished.  Anyway Im just looking for some information on it.  She believes it was made in the 1920's.  If you can actually lead me to information about this, along with an estimated price, Ill give you gold.It says Romanelli Coffee on it.  Thanks guys.

This is in-store only, but it worked for me! Heres the proof. http://imgur.com/Uogy04pOk, heres what to do.  American Eagle is running a sale *50% off any Christmas special items*, these are just jeans, khakis, and chinos (retail $44.95 ea), well these are all buy one get 50% off on top of that I used coupon to get another 10 off the purchase. http://couponsprintablecodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/american-eagle-coupons-crafts-clothes_ocche_1.jpg.  I at the time didnt know it was buy one get one 50% off, so I went and picked up my khakis that I liked (retail $59.95 ea), THIS IS IMPORTANT - I gave them the more expensive pair second, and it discounted the SECOND ITEM RANG UP.  It didnt discount the now $14.95 jeans it discounted 50% off of the 59.95 khakis.  59.95 khakis + 44.95 Jeans = $104.9Still Honors Christmas sale + Buy one get one 50% + $10 off + ring up more expensive pair second = $29.46Saved $75 bucks on total purchase.  I was extremely happy.

I think they are fun and keep me interested in the game.  I love Clash, but seriously Clashs Achievement section is incredibly subpar.  In clash you could host a world of crazy Achievements that would be an absolute blast to attempt to complete.  I dont even care if I get gems or not for completing the goals, give me like 150k Gold and Elixer, let me decide if I want a different color on buildings (EX: let me put, other than Red on my cannons, air sweeper or XBows when maxed), give me a new stupid decoration to show off I completed a hard challenge, different color balloons for traps, and maybe we could add in different armor options for the King and Queen.  Seriously there is so much here that SuperCell could add in that would be of great benefit to the game that they are not acting upon.I love Achievements and they really keep me active in the game.Feel free to add in your own of either challenges or rewards, the more creative the better!Just my 2 cents. Thoughts?

This is a children's book I read when I was about 8 or 9 years old. I read it at school (Public, US). My memory is foggy, so take these details with a grain of salt:* The majority of the plot takes place on an island* There are fantasy elements* My main (true) memory is that I drew a map of the island (which I don't have now), so I think that the action in the story spans multiple locations on the island.* I want to say that either monkeys or dolphins (or both?) play a role* The protagonist reaches and/or leaves the island via a flying wagon (like, Radio Flyer style)Good luck.

We just had our little girl, and she was tongue tied ([Ankylogossia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankyloglossia)). It affects their ability to feed, and apparently the degree of her tie was "profound." It was a learning experience for us, but we had it fixed around week 2, and since then her feedings have been great.Now she's happy, health and gaining weight. She also sticks her tongue out a lot. I assume that's a good thing.One heads up for anyone in the same position: The procedure is bloody. She actually didn't seem to mind too much (I would say she had the same response she has to shots), but it's definitely hard to watch for new parents.That's my story!

2yuqdd	-54150	1426203749	books	Cloud Atlas: A Total Misreading	Ok, I just wanted to share my experience of reading Cloud Atlas. Now, it’s a fine book. This is not a criticism. Rather, while reading Cloud Atlas, I THOUGHT I saw what the author was doing with the story, and… IT WAS AMAZING. Or rather, it was going to be amazing. It didn’t go the way I thought it would (and again, not a criticism of where it ended up going!). At this point, my circle of friends knows this as my “Cloud Atlas Rant.” One preface: I totally go in for books where the author not only tells a story, but does something interesting in the telling of the story itself. Maybe they do so in a way that illustrates something about the nature of storytelling itself. Italo Calvino is one of my favorites (and “If On a Winter's Night a Traveler” is a great illustration of what I’m talking about here). With that said, let’s begin.Okay, so I go into Cloud Atlas knowing nothing about the story or its structure. I enjoy the stories in the first half, and am intrigued by the little ways the stories weave together. I’m liking the concept that, in some way, each protagonist is consuming the story in which their story is nested. So far so good.I finish the 2nd half of the Zachry story then, about halfway through the 2nd half of Sonmi451 my idea starts to brew. Sonmi is consuming the Cavendish story and, presumably, her story is going to end with her settling down to watch the 2nd half. Also, at this point I’m pretty sure that the 2nd half is going to involve Cavendish trying to escape. So Somni, who is a captive sentenced to death, is about to settle down and watch the 2nd half of a story in which a defeated protagonist (Cavendish) will make his escape.And now my hypothesis forms. David Mitchell has written a book of stories in which I, the reader, actually finish each story in my mind. I’m able to do this because I know what each protagonist is reading/watching/etc. at the conclusion of their written story. Because of what I, the reader, know about how art influences life, how we are inspired by literature, etc. I am able to infer the TRUE ending to each story. Somni sits down, finishes Cavendish’s story of his daring escape… and is inspired to make her own daring escape! A whole ‘last chapter’ to the Somni story unfolds in my mind, and it unfolds because of what I know Somni will do based on what she’s reading! Somni takes action based on what she’s reading and I, the reader, complete her story because of what I’m reading!Now I test my hypothesis. Cavendish sits down at his conclusion and reads Luisa Rey’s story… Luisa will end up at the funeral of Sachs’ funeral, focusing on an important personal connection in the midst of this huge, multinational scandal. Therefore, Cavendish’s REAL story will end with him being inspired to make good with his brother, by realizing what ‘really matters.’ (at this point I’m halfway through Luisa Rey’s 2nd story).From here I kind of piece the rest together. Not sure about the Luisa/Frobisher connection. However, Frobisher will finish by reading the rest of the Adam Ewing story. Goose will end up saving Adam (look, I know), and somehow that will make Frobisher decide to change his relationship with VyVyan. Again, it gets pretty weak at this point because I haven’t read the 2nd half of the stories I’m speculating about.But it doesn’t matter! This is incredible! The telling of each of these stories causes me, the reader, to ‘complete’ the preceding story in my mind! I have become part of the story telling process! And, it’s because of the nature of storytelling itself, and how I know each protagonist will react to the stories they, themselves, are reading at the conclusion of their ‘written’ story on the page! I’m telling my wife this is more than a book! This is a piece of participatory art! I am having an experience!So anyone that has read the books knows that, at this point, I’m way off. Totally missing the point. Once I complete the Frobisher story the wind has been taken out of my sails. I grind through the rest of the book. I don’t care. Totally dejected.Eventually I read it again and, yeah, it’s a great book. However, it’s totally tainted for me, because it’s not this other thing I though it was. It’s totally my own fault. I’m notoriously bad at seeing where stories are going, and this was the worst of times.However, I will write the story I wanted some day! It won’t be Cloud Atlas 2 (The Atlassing), but it will be a collection of stories that, through their own relationship, may just cause the reader to create their own beautiful endings to each story. And then the reader becomes their own story teller. Come on!**Tl;dr** – I totally misinterpreted Cloud Atlas about halfway through, and my ‘misinterpretation’ will someday be my greatest creation.
37qcsk	-54150	1432914274	piano	Left hand only music recommendations?	Hey all! I'm looking at an injured right shoulder with surgery on the way, so I think two-handed playing is no longer an option for a while. Anyone have any recommendations for left hand only pieces? I'm more into romantic, not at all a pro, but I've been playing for about 20 years off and on. The most difficult thing I can normally play is probably Chopin Étude Op. 10, No. 3, but I don't really care if something 'difficult' or not. I'm more just into pretty, challenging and interesting.Any thoughts? I'll post up some recordings if get anything sounding good. Thanks!

Title explains the post.I've been playing normals for a long time, been playing league for a long time, but I still don't think I have the art of roaming down. This (plus a lot of other things that I won't delve into) is one of the reasons I find myself losing lots of games because even if I do well, and even if I do actively roam, I can't find anything due to wards or lanes being pushed up.Can anybody give me a couple pointers in terms of roaming from the mid lane (what am I missing, what I can do, etc.)? I feel helpless when my bot lane/top lane doesn't have too hot of a game and I always pin the blame on myself for not roaming more, but even when I do I can't seem to find anything.

I signed off, and I came back the next day to see that I couldn't join VAC servers due to "unsignatured files". I searched the question on google and reddit to find that other people faced the same problem, and I tried to implement the game cache verification people recommend, and it worked the first time. I the logged off, re logged in, and found the same problem bugging me again. To play, I'd have to constantly verify the game cache.I then brought the issue to steam support, who recommended to refresh steam files and then try and verify the game cache. While this helped, it ended up in the same way as before, where I just logged in today to play to find the same annoying message.**TL;DR: unsignatured files, a little annoying to have to verify the game cache every time, anybody have any idea what is wrong?**

wnh39	-54192	1342458634	Games	Looking for a 1st/3rd person game with invasions and large scale fights	I'll do my best to describe what I'm trying to find and would appreciate any help.I loved moments in games where you play as a single character or a squad and have to deal with lots of simultaneous fighting going on between computer players as well. The end of oblivion, the civil war in skyrim, and parts of FEAR 2, deadspace and doom 3(if I remember correctly) when you'd hear or see people trying to fend off enemies and dying all around you. Maybe even the world events that a good number of mmos have in which cities are attacked by mobs and the players have to defend.I snagged the Mount and Blade collection off steam and I get the impression that's somewhat close to what I'm looking for. I'd love anything with the feeling of being just one person in a larger battle that is happening separate from the player, but stuff that deals more with invasions would be awesome! Maybe not necessarily a large battle, but something different than just all the enemies focused on the characters you control. Do you guys have any games that come to mind that invoke that same sort of feeling?Thanks for any help!Edit: Come to think of it, Star Wars Battlefront 2 is pretty awesome in this regard, although it does make you feel more expendable than I'd like. I think I'll have to pick it up on steam too!

1jrjx3	-54209	1375736026	Fitness	I increased my Testosterone by 71% (from 371 to 635) naturally in three months. Here's how...	About me: 45-year-old male, 6'1" 190# I had my T tested April 30 because I was feeling low energy, subtly depressed, lack of strength, difficult to lose weight (I am up 15# in the last 2 years). My test came back 371 - within the range, but near the low end. I considered pursuing TRT but given the hassles and risks, I decided I'd rather see what I could do on my own.All right. There are a lot of variables here, and some may have had more effect than others. What worked for me may not do as much for you. By and large, I believe that the most benefit came from heavy lifting. I did 1-hour + workouts, with heavy compound lifts, five days a week. Prior to this I hadn't been working out consistently at all.**The Recipe:**Primary ingredients:* Heavy lifting and lots of it - Squats, deadlifts, bench press, overhead press, chins, dips, etc.* Protein - Protein Powder after workouts, Eggs (3-6/day), lean meats.* Mineral supplements - mainly zinc, magnesium, selenium, also vitamin D.Secondary ingredients:* Creatine - used during the last two weeks. I don't think it increased T, but possibly helped muscle recovery.* DAA - I did one 2-week cycle of D-aspartic acid early in the process. I didn't feel like it made any difference, but it is supposed to increase leutinizing hormone and, in turn, testosterone. Who knows?One other factor:I am on thyroid replacement, and have been for 20 years (thyroidectomy at 25). About 8 weeks ago I had my doctor increase my dosage of T3 (the symptoms of low T and low thyroid are similar. It's worth exploring both). Theoretically the two endocrine systems (TRH-TSH-T3/T4 and GnRH-LH/FSH-Test) are independent, but I can't rule out the possibility that higher thyroid levels don't have some effect. Mainly, it gave me more energy which helped me to get off the couch and go work out. I know this is largely bro-science, but I think the exercise, particularly the type of exercise I did, had the most impact. I hope someone finds this helpful. I don't think I left much out, but if you want any details feel free to post questions. ________________________________________Update:There are many variables here, but after a lot of discussion it seems that while weights and diet may have had some effect, the Thyroid medication dosage was likely a significant factor in increasing Testosterone. I wasn't trying to mislead anyone and didn't realize the relationship was as strong as it probably is. Thanks everyone for your positive comments and sharing knowledge on the subject. I guess, if this can be helpful to anyone, it's to know that if you are dealing with symptoms of low Testosterone, be sure to have your Thyroid levels tested as well. Symptoms are similar, increasing Thyroid may bring up Testosterone levels, and you want to be sure you are treating the real problem.

1mbf2y	-54209	1379083311	Fitness	Resting my shoulder after some pain. What lifts can I do now? Which ones should I add slowly or avoid?	I've been having some shoulder pain (tendinitis/bursitis?) on certain lifts and it hasn't been getting better, so I decided to give it some rest to heal and let the inflammation die down.I'd say bench press is probably the worst. Using a narrower grip helps somewhat. Anyway, I've decided to lay off all shoulder work this week, and anything that aggravates the shoulder. What I'm wondering is what exercises can I start into first that likely won't bring back the problem? And what exercises should I start into slowly or with lighter weights? Any advice you can give is appreciated.

I'm wondering, could you find enough good deals to keep continually improving the car you have?

If you're an involved parent and spend a fair amount of time on school property (where I assume cc is prohibited in most or all states), do you just leave it in the car or home every time?  Do you manage it another way?  Have you ever forgotten and then realized you had your gun where it shouldn't be? Stopping by schools twice a day or more requires some very conscious attention to your carry/non-carry methods. I'm sure this kind of issue applies to people in other walks of life too, but schools seem like a big one to comply with.

Sieve me a chance” She told me she had just ended a waffle iron relationship and didn't want to baste my timer. I plattered her by complimenting her on her spice rack. She really bowled me over when she said she liked my mug. I thought I had a shot glass so asked if I could colander some time. She said I could counter in. I said “hey, let's fry” and whisked her away around the butcher block to my plate. When we got there, she showed me her Tupperware and told me to get out of my drawers. I thought I might get lucky, but she said it was too spoon. I promised I wouldn't love her and cleaver. Then she asked if I could blender some money. I thought she was trying to shaker me down. But she told me she had just lost her job down at the pepper mill and it's just not rolling pin like it used to. Well, being an ice guy, I forked over some dough. But that strainered the relationship. We had a big spatula, then she left town on the gravy boat and I haven't seen her since.

Seems like a queue of some sort for people interested in receiving an invite would work better than lurking and hoping to find someone offering while we're on watch.   - Just a thought. I'm not sure how it can be implemented.Edit: This post is sort of taking off. So, if this actually becomes something we will need:  * some way to check off or remove names of those who have received an invite.  * some way to keep the order fair, so someone doesn't claim the next in line when they should be last.  * some way to keep this list visible to those with invites so they know this is the place to look, and  * a way for inviters to easily find the next invitee in the queue. Maybe that's too much for a comment thread to accomplish. Feel free to share thoughts (and invites).

2urrky	-54209	1423069598	atheism	Handling Jehovah's Witnesses - my encounter, and wondering how to do better.	Yesterday morning I had the pleasure of opening my front door to a pair of Jehovah's Witnesses - two elderly men. Rather than dismissing them, I decided to engage in a little debate. I did fairly well for an off-the-cuff discussion. I brought up things like the validity of other gods - Allah, Buddah (technically not a god), Zeus, forgot the Flying Spaghetti Monster. I mentioned the age of Christianity vs other religions, the age of earth, the universe, humans, touched on evolution. When they said humans were 5000 years old, I set down the Watchtower issue he'd handed me and told them "there's no point in discussing this if you won't even acknowledge that we've found scientific evidence of human (hominid) life from at least 500,000 years ago. I also mentioned how the most religious politicians are the ones denying climate change and standing in the way of progress. Oh yeah, and I mentioned the insanity of the idea that a loving god would banish you to hell for breaking one of his rules. Turns out JW's don't believe in hell. Oops.Anyway, I'm wondering what else I could have brought up that would have been effective for debating their religion, catching them in some contradictions, and giving them the message that I'm not buying their deluded fairy tale. It's been a long time since I read any of the bible, and I don't know anything about the JW version, so that's where I'm weak for this kind of debate. I'd probably prefer to stick with the science vs myth angle anyway. Any help would be appreciated.tl,dr: I debated some JW's pretty well, but would like some suggestions for the best ways to question them about their religion and make them squirm a bit.

3diccl	-54209	1437057669	Cameras	Deciding on a M43 camera, looking for advice.	I've pretty much narrowed down to either the new Panasonic G7 or the older Gx7.  I'm wondering if for casual amateur photos and video I really need all the capability of the G7. I could save some money towards lenses (about $200) by getting the Gx7.  Advantages of the G7: newer, 4k video, maybe nicer grip, mic input...  Advantages of Gx7: smaller, less expensive, very good reviews...Would I likely be satisfied with the Gx7 or will it be showing its age too quickly? I don't think I need or even have a use for 4k video right now, but I recognize the G7 is probably a bit more future-proof. The simple thing would be to go with the G7, but that's quite a bit to spend when I'm not even sure how much I, or the family, will actually use it in the long run. Any viewpoints appreciated, thanks.

3j3qwm	-54209	1441039503	atheism	If financial advisors operated like evangelists they'd be thrown in prison.	After listening to several hours of religious radio, I've come to the conclusion that evangelists are no better than fraudsters. Would you invest with a financial professional who offered you an investment with the promise that "if you only believe in it" you will end up in the distant future with a financial windfall so great that you won't ever worry about money again? He won't be able to offer you any proof of how your investment is doing along the way, or that your money is even still there, but just believe and you shall receive. Have faith. However, if your faith isn't strong enough, or pure enough, (or you once thought your neighbor's wife looked kind of hot) then all could be lost and you would be subjected to complete financial ruin for the rest of eternity. Oh, and by the way, be sure to convince all your friends and family to invest too. Sounds too much like a Ponzi scheme to me. I think I'll manage my own money, thank you very much.

I was planning on walking every street south of Calhoun and documenting/researching interesting places to develop personalized tours for my friends and family, but I've run out of time and have little done. I'm still planning to do this (and would be happy to share the results), but I know I won't be able to finish before Christmas.What I'm asking, Charlestonians, is for places with interesting stories to tell (such as Philadelphia Alley or the house that has evidence of cannon fire) or interesting people that can be connected to a certain place (such as the dentist who painted his house the color of healthy gums) on the peninsula that I could take my friend to, preferably places off the beaten path.So, what are your favorite places and stories?Thanks a lot!

They have to shed their old shell to progress. When they shed their old shell and are waiting for their new shell to grow, they're vulnerable and scared. But that vulnerability is necessary for growth. Her point was that sometimes we have to let go of part of our past and our preconceived notions in order to become better people, even if that can be frightening.I think that's particularly apt for us.Anyone else have any words of wisdom you'd like to share?
2tud10	-54222	1422369677	AskHistorians	What was the GPA system like in the '40s? (Grade inflation)	Yesterday in class, my professor showed us [this](http://www.gradeinflation.com), which shows that the average GPA in colleges in the US in the '40s was around 2.4. My first thought was that maybe they used a different scale back then, which converts to today's 2.4, but my teacher said it was the same scale. Is that true? If so, why was 2.4 the norm? That corresponds to a C. I was wondering why they made a scale where 4.0 was the highest option when almost no school averaged even close to that high. Is it because they wanted the current average (C) to be the middle of the GPA system? And even if that's the case, why would colleges be satisfied that the majority of their students are understanding 70-79% of the material, especially compared to today's B average?Any enlightenment on this general topic would be welcome.

I just finished coming out to all the family members I planned to tell individually (parents, one brother, grandma, one aunt, and grandma and grandpa). Hooray!I feel both relieved and nervous. Relieved for obvious reasons, it no longer feels like I'm hiding anything and everyone was incredibly supportive. I'm nervous both because it makes it real and because it means that the next step for me is to come out to my classmates and professors this week. It's a small cohort program with eight other students in all four of my classes (plus a few extra from another program in one of those classes), plus I'm a graduate assistant for three professors. I think I'll single out three people to tell privately beforehand and then just tell the rest of my classmates in a group and anyone else whenever I happen to see them.That's it, just wanted to share my progress and type out my plan, though I'm not adverse to advice. Thanks for reading this far!

I'm in the market for some nice new shoes but I'm a guy with  really small feet. This is not a good combination in terms of choice.tldr; I'm looking at two specific shoes right now and I'd like to know which is likely to be the best value given my specific wear conditions. I know I could find similar threads but I'd like advice tailored to my specific situation. *I'm also open to any advice on other shoes that may fit my needs.*Without further ado, I have small feet - men's size 4.5-5, women's size 6-6.5 ([based on this size conversion chart](http://www.zappos.com/measure-your-shoe-size), I'm currently wearing a comfortably fitting, cheap women's 6.5 boot that's falling apart) - and this has limited my search. My options at the moment seem to be this [Iron Ranger](http://www.zappos.com/red-wing-heritage-6-iron-ranger-amber-harness) or the women's version of the [Wolverine 1000 Mile](http://www.wolverine.com/US/en-US/Product.mvc.aspx/29368W/0/Womens/1000-Mile-Boot?dimensions=0) which is nearly identical to the men's. I've looked into children's boots too but with no luck. I like both of these boots; they're my style and they'll work both casually and at the office and classes. I'd be happy with either.However, I'm a college student, so I'm hesitant to spend that kind of money before I'm sure that I'm investing in something very long-lasting, which is why I'm asking for advice.Whichever boot I buy, I will be wearing them at least five days a week (possibly all seven), walking an average of 5 miles a day. I'll be walking through frequent rain and flooding and over somewhat rough city terrain (jagged sidewalks). I also have an awkward gait that tears up soles quickly. I destroyed my (admittedly very cheap ($30)) current boots in less than four months (and they're currently Krazy glued). I don't intentionally destroy my things, but I'm not one to devote much if any time to maintenance. The most I usually do in terms of care is filling them with newspaper if they get wet.Will either of these shoes be worth the price considering how badly I wear out shoes? Is one better than the other in this regard? Am I being completely unrealistic, and if so, can you offer any alternatives?I appreciate any and all advice. Thanks for your time.
2yeu58	-54222	1425876764	braces	Retainer Replacement Question	EDIT2: Ignore this post.First time posting here, let me know if I should post somewhere else or change anything.About a week ago, I went to sleep wearing my (Hawley) retainer and woke up without it. I found the bottom piece on the floor. I figured I'd find the top piece in my blankets later and didn't think too much about it.It's been a week and I still haven't found it despite frequent searching. At this point, I should probably get a replacement. I'm a college student short on time and money, but I still have my original plaster molds. I no longer live anywhere near my orthodontist.What are my options? Ideally, I'd like to send my mold out to a company as I feel like that would be the easiest and cheapest method. Do you know any reputable companies that will do this? The cheaper the better, since I'm still hoping to find my original eventually.Thanks, Reddit!EDIT: It has to be Hawley. I can't sleep in the plastic ones. I drove my ortho insane when I first got my retainer (about 7 years ago) because I refused to wear it. Once she switched me over to Hawley, I wore it nightly.EDIT2: I finally found it! It was tangled up in some power cords under a table on the other side of the room.

She's a physical education instructor and I assume she wants to use it in her classes.It actually feels a bit like a conspiracy. Everyone in the YouTube comments is giving the same wrong answer. Google suggests the first two lines once I start typing it but doesn't have any answers.  Even YouTube automatically fills in "world cup edition dude perfect *song*" so people must be searching for this.Help?Thanks.
30rede	-54222	1427679698	literarywriters	Thoughts on non-traditional literary fiction?	It seems that most of the literary fiction (based on what I understand to be literary fiction) that I've read is very much set in the real world. The only exception that I can think of is Tom Perotta's The Leftovers, which is based on the premise of the Rapture.Are there any other literary stories out there that aren't entirely realistic?I'm working on a novel right now. Originally, when my 16yo self wrote the first draft, it was a fantasy novella. Now, I'm intending it to be literary fiction and I think it's working well. It's very character-driven. I only have one fantasy/paranormal element in the story, which is that a species exists in my story universe that doesn't exist in our reality, but it's a major part of the story. One of the main central themes in my story is how people cope with the unknown and come up with explanations for things that they can't understand.Do you think that literary readers would enjoy a story with an element of fantasy (or sci-fi, or whatever)? I'm not necessarily looking for advice specific to me, just hoping to spark a general discussion. Do you think the suspension of disbelief required of readers is different between different genres of fiction?
33askz	-54222	1429576454	ftm	Update Post!	When's the last time I posted, December?Well, in December I had my big revelation that, yup, definitely trans. I'd been in therapy since late September, just a month after I had moved to a brand new state (SC).My friends had been following along with my self-discovery journey, so they basically already knew. I told a few key members of my family and then told them that they could tell everyone else. I told everyone I interact with at school and at work (which are basically the same people because I work as a graduate assistant in my department).Today, I got my T letter. I could have gotten it a couple months ago, but I wanted to wait until summer to start because grad school is stressful on its own. My first endo appointment is June 4th.In non-trans news, my brother who lives a few towns over is getting married in a month and just before that, I'll be traveling back to my old state to visit friends and family that I haven't seen in too long.So overall, my life is going great. I'm more stressed about grad school and financial aid than I am about transitioning, and that's a good thing.I look forward to June and the rest of my life, and I'm so thankful for the community here. You guys rock.EDIT: What exactly is a first endo appointment generally like? I get nervous when I don't know what to expect.
36nxjg	-54222	1432150410	nerdfighters	Make It Happen	I always have dozens of ideas of things that I want to do. Maybe there should be a video series about this that I should make. Maybe I could start an organization in my community that does this. Maybe this should be a thing. Maybe I should do that. Many of them I even start. I have more rough drafts and outlines and business plans for projects than I care to count.I'm sure I'm not the only one who wants to take on more than they can actually handle. I know that I have to pick just a couple of things, the things that I'm most passionate about, and devote my full attention to those, but I don't want to abandon the rest completely, because I think they should exist.Maybe there's other people, people who have the passion and skills to finish projects but need something to get behind.Some projects, I'd love to give complete control over to someone who I know will be able to devote more of their time to it than I could. Some projects, I'd just like to find people who would like to team up to work on it. John and Hank can be involved in so many projects because they're not doing it themselves.Is there a site like this, where people can share projects (and associated documents)? If not, can we make one? I could post all my projects here and hope someone bites, but I think it would be great if there was some sort of place specifically to exchange projects and ideas, sort of like Kickstarter but for much earlier on in the development process. This would be great not just for Nerdfighteria, but for everyone.Thoughts?

3ckk0w	-54222	1436375215	ftm	Brother won't tell 5yo niece that I'm a guy...advice?	So my niece (O) is 5 and she's adorable. Her mom (my SIL) is totally cool with my transition. Her dad (my bro) supports me but is worried that my transition is going to screw O up, even though I've told him that's ridiculous. So, my SIL was the one who talked to O about how I changed my name and that instead of calling me "Aunt [Birthname]," she should call me "Adrian" instead, and my SIL and brother avoid using pronouns to refer to me in front of her. That's been great (or at least better). The last few times I saw her, she seemed to be a bit confused about my gender and would occasionally use male pronouns, put me in the role of male characters, and asked me questions like why I have short hair. Last weekend, though, she gendered me girl the whole weekend. I think she's sort of adapted her worldview like, "Adrian kinda looks like a boy but is really a girl." Which would be great if I were a masculine-presenting girl, but I'm not. I started T three weeks ago. I'm planning on seeing them at least every two weeks to make the transition more gradual. My main issue is that I think my brother isn't going to tell her that I'm a guy until O says something like, "Why does Adrian have beard hair if she's a girl?" or she asks why strangers are calling me "he." My SIL recognizes that that is ridiculous and that not telling her is going to cause more problems than telling her. But I really don't think my brother is going to acknowledge the issue until it's that blatantly obvious, and I don't think my SIL can make him see reason. I get that she's his kid and it's his decision, but I'm worried that waiting until it's impossible to ignore will confuse her more than them telling her now will.TL;DR: My brother isn't going to tell his 5yo daughter that I'm a guy until I start fully passing, and I'm concerned about how that might affect her more than if he told her now.Does anyone have an advice on how I can convince my brother to talk to O about it (or to let my SIL talk to her about it)? Failing that, does anyone have any advice on how to tell a child that age in general, or any personal stories about telling a family member that age?Thanks, guys.

If I in for a fling, I know he will fling as well, if I try to poison trail, he will try to get in front and so on. Feels like my mind gets in a knot. Anyone else have this sort of feeling?

So my question is, how big of a difference is the real deal and what additional training would be helpful in preparation for extended duration trips?
wsh27	-54227	1342658045	AskReddit	Recent college grad looking for advice on staying social.	So I recently graduated from an engineering university and am back home looking for a job.  Home being a small suburb of NYC that the vast majority of inhabitants are either high school and below or 35 and above.  Nobody I know from my university lives anywhere near me and my old high school friends are all gone for the most part.  So basically I am back at square one in terms of socialization.This leads me to my question...What are some good ways that I (any anyone else who is or will be in a similar position) can stay social even in these inconvenient situations?

12wiia	-54227	1352443433	AskEngineers	Engineering managers, which is better? Field experience or company experience	So I am a recent grad and new hire to a large Fab and hold a management position.  The two guys I am mainly in charge of are always bickering about which one technically has authority over the other.  One has about 2 years of experience with the company, but outside of those two years, does not have any direct experience with my particular field but still has been working in somewhat similar manufacturing all his life.  He knows the particular machines in my facility better than guy 2.  The other has been in the field all his life but has only been with the company for about 5 months.  His knowledge of the field itself and the inner workings of how its run better than guy 1.Which do you think is more important?  Field experience or company experience?
1307d4	-54227	1352630076	summonerschool	Nunu + Kog early-mid game advice	My partner and I play a lot of normal draft (he plays Kog usually and I play Nunu usually) and I had a few questions about laning phase aura items.  We do pretty well but I am always open to more advice.  If anyone could critique my strategy I would be grateful.My normal opening is Charm, Wardsx3 and 1 of each pot.  Because of Nunu BB (which I rank even with Ice Ball, taking BB first) I don't feel the need to get boots before both my GP10s.  Until level 3, I usually keep kog constantly buffed just in case he has an opportunity to harass or we need to fall back so by lvl 3, unless I have been doing some harass with Ice Ball, ill usually be around half mana.When I get the chance, I usually stack my passive by attacking the cannon minion, since that tends to be easier to CS for my carry than hitting the other minions 1 or 2 times a piece.  Also I try to only use consume on full health cannon minions so they dont die at early levels.  This sometimes pushes the lane a bit and Kog does not have much in the way of escapes.At this point I grab t1 books and like taking either an early Orac or pushing for a Zekes (not sure if I should for for AoL first instead).  Its usually not until after my first aura item and maybe another health item that I go for t2 boots (CDR boots).At this point we just play a standard "Protect the Kog" game.  Is there anything I should change and are there any other supports that synergize well with Kog (My partner is dead set on using kog alone unfortunately)?

I usually only play him when my ADC needs the AS steroid but sometimes I just feel like playing him.  Its during these times that I usually get confused if I should level my ice blast more than BB.  This is my usual basic thought process when choosing.BB:1)ADC scales well with AS2)Enemy Jungler has hard CC gap closer (MS keeps out of initiation distance rather than risking IB to slow them down)3)Facing strong early lane (Mostly farming near or under tower)4)Team Jungler has no hard CC gap closer (needs MS buff to catch up in his gank)5)Enemy ADC/Support focus heavily on Skill Shots (makes it easier to dodge)IB:1)Enemy ADC scales well with AS (Slowing their AS more important than increasing team ADCs AS)2)Team ADC good at trading pokes (for focus poking either of the enemy champs)3)Team Jungler can tower dive well (prioritize hurting them more than helping team)4)Enemy Jungle has MS steroid (IB slow becomes more effective than BB escape)5)Team Jungle is tanky/support (So I can add some AP to build)Not everything is down on this list but for the most part I feel these are the most important details.  Depending on which side has more ill usually level that first.  I would love to hear any disagreements on the basic list and anything that would be good to add to my thought process

Those things are pointless (for the most part, haven't played B/W yet). I would change it so that you can trade version exclusive pokemon. For example pokemon Ruby And Sapphire, you could trade a seed in game for a lotad. However, you wouldn't be able to get all the version exclusive pokemon, just a few. So, I am curious, what would you change?TL;DR? I would change in game trades to trade a few version exclusive pokemon to help the pokedex. What would you change?

1ahx6w	-54242	1363569755	NoFap	Beginning my no fap journey	so my story, real quick, is that I was a pretty self-conscious kid, being husky and what not, and I discovered porn. Being self-consious I never thought a girl would have sex with me so I got really into porn. It felt...good. I saw things I never expected to see and I slowly got addicted (even if I denied It). I discovered many free sights and forums that gave me what I wanted when I wanted.    Recently It hasn't been enough and I started getting into the weird porn, the stuff that makes people look at you like you just killed a kid, type of porn. I know it is wrong but nothing else works as fast anymore. Also recently I met a girl who I really, really like and this Wednesday will be our 7 weeks together.    I bring this up because, tonight we were ready for sex (both of us are virgins so it was a big deal) or at least it would have been, but when It came to it, I just couldn't get hard. I don't know if it was because I was nervous or not, but something In my mind screamed (porn). I was more embarrassed at that time than I have ever been.    So here I am. I don't know what the reason for what happened is, but porn will not be beneficial to anything I do, so I am giving it up, for real this time and not like the hundreds of other times I said I would and didn't. I am done with it and I wanted to make sure to make it official and announce it, to keep myself honest. I will be looking to you guys for guidance and help because I know it wont be easy, but I know I can do it!    So, right now marks day 1 of 90 and more of no-fap. Let the renewal begin!

1p7ft7	-54245	1382722789	leagueoflegends	My prediction for upcoming S4 meta	Hi,I will try to keep it simple and short this is my view of next meta. This is just my view.  Ok i will first start with **TOP LANE**            For solo-top players i think that it will stay pretty much same, depending on team composition it will be bruisers or assassins.Only different thing will be trinkets. We have triangle of trinkets.Ward trinket&gt;CV trinket&gt; Sweeper Trinket&gt; Ward trinket.So you can see there is triangle like paper&gt;rock&gt;scissors .Probably first trinket will be wild guess and from that point it will be some kind of mind games (because you can free change trinkets in base). It's a fun concept.**MID LANE**I think that Marksmen's will take this lane. Its harder to gank lane and they have better tower rushing potential then classic AP Mids. You all know that mid turret is most valuable turret for map control. Also , most Marksmen's don't have hard cc like APC so they fit better in mid lane because it's shorter.  For trinket i think that it will be Ward or CW.**BOT LANE**In bot lane i expect APC, it's easier to gank and most APC have some kind of escape or hard cc to avoid or help with ganks.Trinkets will be like in top lane , mostly mind games but i think more focused on Ward or CW.**JUNGLE**With new extra camps and more xp i think that main camps will clear Jungler. Side camps will be for Support or i will call it Sweeper. His job is to provide and destroy enemy vision (maybe wards will get you some xp) but he can also help Jungler and gank. It deppends about champions. Also they can clear jungle together but i can't say now what is better. **SUMMARY**Whit this changes I think that game will be more dynamic, not just farming. Map vision will change every second, you will need to outsmart your laning opponent with trinkets and also keep csing/poke and be more carefully because there will be 2 junglers.

I had that card since Nov 2010 and i absolutely love it. I think it's video RAM (VRAM) failure and one guy already tried to fix it but unsuccessfully. So I am looking for some cheap graphic card that is in that range but maybe even better.   I mostly use my PC for college and that's reason why i can't afford some high end card. I like to sometimes play some games like LoL or HS but i am looking forward to play GTAV or Tom Clancy's the division when they came out.  Rest of my PC is : 4 GB Ram  AMD Athlon II X4 640 @ 3.0Ghz  Asrock 770 EXTREME3  Samsung HD502HJ 500GB ( I was planning to upgrade this to SSD but that not gonna happened soon)  Also I am regularly checking /r/buildapcsales and I am trying to find some subreddit with some contest and giveaways (hardware) , is there such thing?

In meantime i had HD4650, everything worked fine. When i install new card (7790) my pc didnt turn on. So I disconnect everything but CPU on motherboard and tried again but it fails. It start for about half second ( vents start spinning) and just stop. After pressing again power button it doesn't do anything, even vents dont spin. When i disconnect 24pin and 8 pin from motherboard and connect again i get same effect, just half second. I even pick up battery half minutes from motherboard.   I tried that PSU (seasonic S12 , 520 W) on another pc on some old motherboard and it worked. I also check with paper clip and it worked.  Does anyone have any solutions? EDIT: Its seem like there is some safety switch because i cant power it again for like 10 minutes or when i dissconect and recconect all cables from mother board) . And when i finaly power it up it last just half second and its dead. Thank you in advance and sorry for my english.EDIT2: Here is solution.After i got good sleep my friend brought me his power supply. We power up with "new" PSU and it worked. Then we connected back my old PSU and it worked. I dont know how but it works now.

Thanks for all your hard work, buddy? no.He says "I guess it pays to pray".......I imagine in his mind, once he prayed to God for his account to be fixed, God went back in time to my childhood and forced me to make good life decisions that would eventually carry me to this place, in this job, so that I could make sure this good christian man has his e mail.

She says I take things from the bible out of context to make it sound bad. So I ask her if throwing rocks at someone until they die is in any way out of context, or not at all in the bible. She actually says "Go fuck yourself James, I'm not talking to you about this"Excellent. Challenge the bible?

1k1tey	-54263	1376081741	atheism	If Christians are right, isn't it immoral to spread the word?	Sorry if this has been brought up before, but something really bothers me about christianity. From almost every christian I ever talk to, I get the same response to this question. "What about people who never hear about jesus at all, or are taught the wrong religion and don't know any better? Do they all go to hell?" The answer they always come up with is that when they die, God/Jesus will show them the truth and give them the choice to believe/follow, and they can get into heaven. To me, that seems like a pretty easy way of getting into heaven. BUT.... if you have heard about Jesus and you reject christianity, you are doomed to burn in hell. So shouldn't we just stop telling people about jesus and let them be ignorant their whole lives, so they all get a free pass into heaven?

I work on a military base and every year during the holiday season, they put up a nativity scene and a menorah right at the entrance from the main gate. It's nowhere near a church or chapel, and they don't put up any secular decorations or decorations from other faiths. I am going to try to get them to put up something else along side it (mostly because I know they will say no) but I don't want to ask for a festivus pole or just secular decorations like Santa or the Grinch. Are there any good winter holiday decorations from other faiths that I could offer them? Something besides judaism, christianity or catholicism.

33ejwc	-54263	1429653097	atheism	Government Civilian training and the lord	Hey guys! I just wanted to rant a little about the kind of crap I have to deal with working for the government. We have annual training that we have to attend, that covers a very wide variety of subjects. This year already, I've had some very interesting training. First, in the substance abuse training, we had a talk from an AA rep. He mentioned several times in his sermon that he was a christian pastor and that you have to be right with god to recover from addiction. At the end, my friend and I both questioned him about it. My friend simply said "What does recovery look like to the non-religious?" He looked visibly concerned, and he just danced around it saying that "god can mean anything, and I didn't necessarily mean religion". So I raised my hand and asked why the paper he handed out specifically stated that one of the requirements to recover was religious affiliation. He just went right back to the whole "god doesn't mean religion" statement. I mean it was RIGHT THERE on his handout. Then we go to EO training, which is equal opportunity. This is where they teach us that we have to treat everyone the same, and how to file complaints when we are discriminated against. He reminded us several times that he is a christian pastor, and that he has certain beliefs about certain behavior. (I swear, it wasn't the same guy).  He starts getting into WHO can file EO complaints. Seriously, not everyone can. Did you know that if you're under 40 you can't file a complaint for age discrimination? That's right. Your boss, if you work for the army, can discriminate against you in any way they want if it's age based as long as it's not because you're old. But that's not what really pissed me off. He started talking about homosexuals and transsexuals. Basically, he reminded us AGAIN that he was a christian pastor, then he told us a story about a little boy who knew he wanted to be a girl even before he knew what gay or transgender meant. He admitted to everyone in the room that it wasn't a choice for this boy. What did he follow that up with? "What that tells me is that these people have a NUMBER of different issues. But we have to take their feelings into consideration. Their discrimination cases have to be heard just like everyone elses. And to be honest, that's probably what's going to cause me to leave this job." That's right. The fricking Equal Opportunity guy where I work... the guy who's responsible for hearing discrimination complaints and training people on them... wants to quit because he has to treat homosexuals and transgender/transsexual people the same as the rest of us. It upsets him and he's willing to tell a huge classroom full of people about it. He is literally the LAST person on this post who should be talking like this. I can't believe I didn't say anything. I was in shock. My jaw was dropped open unable to move. And as I looked around, I was the only one visibly disturbed by his comments. Most people were just nodding in agreement. our government. Oh and the EO guy was actually a government employee. The AA guy was a guest speaker. Neither of them should have been able to say what they were saying in a classroom. Paid for by the government. Sorry for the long rant. It's just been bothering me since it happened. I just... I can't even right now.

1gtn0b	-54266	1371853161	leagueoflegends	I've got a question about points in while queueing as duo in ranked	My buddy and I have been duo queueing over the past 4-5 days, and are wondering how LP is determined. He started in Silver IV, I started in Silver III. When I was trying to get to my Silver I promotion series, he was in Silver III. I was at 94 LP, and then won a game and got 3 LP, putting me at 97. The game following that, I got 1 LP.I then failed my promotion series and got dropped down to whatever LP, and started getting anywhere from 17-28 LP per game again.I'm now Gold IV getting 20-28 points per game, while he is Silver I getting ~7 points per game.**How does this system work?** When he gets to Gold V, should he start getting the same amount of LP per game as I do? Or do I need to wait even longer to where he's within one division of me?Thanks to anyone who might have some insight. Whether it's speculation, fact, or suggestions on how we can get him more LP per game.*And to note, we first thought I was getting low LP because I was too far ahead of him, but I didn't understand why there were no changes to his LP. I can't really find an understanding for why he isn't getting as many points as I am now.*

2dy0k5	-54266	1408414854	csgobetting	Can CSGOLounge take steps to prevent DDOSing? If so, what do you think they can do?	This is in reference to the recent Macedonia vs. Greece DDOSing. Obviously it's not the first time this has happened, but there hasn't been any positive rules set up against DDOSing. So, I ask you, **what do you think CSGOLounge could do to prevent DDOSing, *or improve the way they deal with it*?**~~~**My Thoughts**:CSGOLounge is a pretty big part of the CSGO competitive scene at this point. The investments that people make into CSGOLounge correlate to a larger audience in matches. Would I watch as many of these random ESEA and CEVO matches as I do if I weren't betting on them? No. I'm sure that is the same for many people. The views on most of the matches outside of majors would plummet without CSGOLounge hosting bets on the matches. The point of bringing this up; CSGOLounge is important to the CSGO leagues and overall competitive scene.**The best way that I have thought to deal with DDOSers is to have CSGOLounge work out a deal with the various leagues**. There needs to be a requirement that **if any league wants to have their games placed on CSGOLounge, they need to require their players to have DDOS protection**. Because of CSGOLounge's importance in the competitive scene, these leagues can't just brush them off.I'll be honest, I'm not sure to what extent DDOS protection provides. If it is a 100% solution to DDOSing, then I believe CSGOLounge should then take some other measure if someone *is* DDOS'd on stream (in other words, if a player did not protect themselves from DDOSing, and gets DDOS'd, then ______ happens). My idea would be to have no games from that league for **X** amount of time, or simply no more bets going up for that team. The former idea would increase the incentive for the league to know their teams have protection, the latter just insures that there isn't a repeat incident.If DDOS protection isn't 100%, then obviously the above doesn't work. (**Note**) Whether DDOS protection is 100% or not, I think my initial idea (CSGOLounge requiring leagues to create a rule that players in their league must have DDOS protection) should go through. If DDOS protection isn't 100%, CSGOLounge needs to figure out a way to deal with matches where a player is being DDOS'd. CSGOLounge can't just say, "If the match continues, the bets stay up" because there is no deterrent to DDOSers. **Currently, if you DDOS, you either better your chances of winning, or your skins are returned**. If you lose, well, everyone loses who bet on that team... so the fact that you DDOS'd a player doesn't do anything to hurt you.**I think if CSGOLounge doesn't work out something with the various leagues, they need to stop putting up bets for these side-tournaments/leagues**. These random players who show up for these tournaments have never needed to protect themselves against DDOSing, so chances are they have no protection. If some people argue that they would rather risk the DDOS than not be able to bet on them, then please respond with a better way to deal with this situation. I'm not against these small tournaments/leagues, they just seem to have a higher rate of DDOS occurrences.I can make a bet not knowing who's going to start CT or T on Nuke. I can make a bet not knowing what map is going to be played. *I can't make a bet not knowing which team is going to face a DDOSer and cost their team 2+ rounds*. The phantom 6th member is just too OP, he doesn't die.~~~**To sum it up**, CSGOLounge needs to figure something out to prevent DDOSing or to deal with it better. There are no negative consequences for those who DDOS; they either better their chances to win, or get their items back. The only thing the current rules do on CSGOLounge are hurt those who don't DDOS, and help those who don't deserve the win/match cancellation. Something needs to deter DDOSing, or else we'll only see more and more of it.What are your thoughts about how CSGOLounge can deal with DDOSing?

I know that, a week ago, if your vehicle was at 100% and died in 1-2 shots, the guy who killed you was hacking. I just died in a BR, twice, with my vehicle dying in 1-2 shots (from 100%). The first time the guy told me "they made it so you can shoot a specific part of the car and 1 shot the car... they wanted to make the vehicle less powerful".Is this true, or just some guy trying to make up an excuse for cheating?

o3eii	-54274	1325731689	AskReddit	Who do you think was the worst teacher you ever had and why?	My worst teacher ever was my 8th grade Biology teacher. A typical day of "teaching" for him would be the following:1) Everyone files into the class and starts doing the bellwork questions on the board2) He looks around to see if everyone's done3) If so, he'll fire up Powerpoint and the projector4) He reads out load the Powerpoints he made and every student has to copy it downAnd that continues until the bell rings. The end. I'll break down the reasons why that was such a bad teaching style. The teacher displayed full-length sentences on the Powerpoint and the second the slide shows up, he starts talking. Generally speaking, the stuff on the board was too complex to get straight off the bat so in order to comprehend it, everybody had to listen to the teacher. This splits a student's attention in half. One half is trying to frantically copy down everything on board, the other half is trying to listen and attempt to comprehend what the student is writing down. Add in the fact that the lights were normally dimmed and no student participation was needed throughout the lesson, and everyone struggles not to fall asleep. I did have a history teacher, also in 8th grade, who used the exact same style of teaching. But with a monotone, however his class was incredibly easy since all of the questions on the tests were given to us in the form of a review game. I believe I never read a single page out of the history textbook the entire year. Still got a A with zero effort. Side note: I developed an interesting skill while I was in Biology. I can now copy down text and not at all remember what I actually write down. But at the same time I can pay a respectable amount of attention to something else.EDIT: I completely forgot about my 6th grade language/history teacher until I read some of the responses! Basically, my teacher at the time was a 60-some year old teacher who I had for both language and history. In language, all we ever did was read books she assigned. In history, we only did pointless shit about Egypt and some other country that I don't care enough about to remember. I don't think I ever opened my history book in her class. All of the stuff we "learned" was absolutely useless. In effect, I didn't learn anything in her class. She also hated me. One time she asked some question and then called on me to answer it (I wasn't paying attention at the time, but I have a freakish ability to recall the last couple seconds while I was day dreaming) I instantly gave her to right answer. She then, completely ignoring my answer, began to berate me on how "arrogant" I was. Ask anyone in my school, and you'll know I never talked unless required to in 6th grade. In the end, I got either a B+ or a A- in both of her classes. She obviously favored this one girl, Jasmine, over everyone. I happened to have both classes with her and Jasmine was never called upon. Every other teacher opted to put me into the gifted classes except for her. But fortunately, my 7th grade history teacher was awesome and after I consecutively got 100% on his tests (which are notorious for being long and difficult), he put me into the gifted group and, by result of scheduling conflicts, I was automatically put into the gifted language class. The bitch teacher also awarded some kid $1 because he raised his standardized testing scores by a pretty significant amount. But I still absolutely murdered that kid in that standardized test. I believe I scored somewhere in the 760s. He scored somewhere in the 720s. Keep in mind the entire score's out of 800 and pretty much everyone was in the low 700s. She has now retired, but if I ever had her again, I would personally punch her in the face. But I am now in every single "gifted" class possible at my high school. I'm fairly certain she was racist. I'm Asian, except for one black person, I'm the only one who's NOT Caucasian in my grade.

vra6i	-54274	1340913403	askscience	Is it actually possible to improve your vision without surgical means?	Long story short, one of my contacts fell out my eye yesterday and I realized just how bad my vision was. I'm only 15 and I wear contacts with -6.00 power (in the right eye, its -3.75 in the left eye). The highest power that contact lens manufacturers sell is -10.00. I'm a little bit scared of what will happen once I reach the top of that scale.I've seen tons of ads about "naturally" improving your vision before, but I never really believed them. A bonus question, is it possible to slow down (or stop) the degradation of your vision? Does that process ever stop? (ie in your 20s, 30s etc?)

[I recently read an article on The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/22/4758880/history-acetaminophen-drug-regulation-fda-tylenol) saying something along the lines of the FDA tightening up the restirctions on usage of popular OTC drugs such as Tylenol due to excessive deaths and hospitalizations. According to that article, there have been 1,500 American deaths (over the past decade) and 33,000 hospitalizations per year. Simultaneously, the article states that "tens of millions of people reportedly use it weekly without adverse effects". [Using some simple math and extrapolation, I arrive at a calculated incidence rate of 0.006375%.](http://i.imgur.com/DYZ6NCU.png) That's less than 7 incidents per 100,000 uses. [The death rate is a mere 0.000028846%.](http://i.imgur.com/rawp5wI.png) Or, less than 3 deaths per ten million uses. That seems crazy low to me. But the FDA apparently thinks this is too high to be acceptable? Why is the tolerance for incidents so low?

I currently have an old laptop (like, a $400 laptop from Walmart bought 5 years ago old) as my home server (plugged into my router via 100 Mb/s Ethernet). It runs Windows Server 2008 R2 (that I got through one of Microsoft's academic programs for free). It's currently a: torrenting server, file server (mostly for videos to stream to my Chromecast, Plex, and iPad), a VPN server (L2TP/IPSec because I could never get OpenVPN to work), and a SSH server (for using as a VPN tunnel for my school-owned Mac that blocks regular VPNs). The power draw, when idle, is about 35 Watts. In my area, that's $3.23 a month when run 24/7. It might use up like 50 Watts when I'm actually using it (for usually no more than 1 hour/day). The big issue with my "home server" (I use that term very loosely) is that it likes to shut down when under heavy load for a few minutes. For example, it shuts down when I scrobble too much while watching a video on my iPad. The video I'm watching has already been transcribed so that it can be directly streamed without needing any transcoding. Yes, the server is that sucky. So, I'm looking to buy/build a ultra-cheap home server that can be more reliable than my laptop is currently. If needed, I can provide a Windows Server license (any edition of any recent year) and a hard drive. I'm considering buying one of those cheap Android sticks (that you're supposed to plug into a TV) and just installing Linux on it. But, the problem with that is I could never get my VPN server to work right on Linux. Setting up a VPN server on Windows is ridiculously easy compared to Linux.

I was just wondering if Purdue gives out significant sums of scholarships to students aside from the trustees and presidential. I'm a new admit for Fall 2015 and I got the Presidential Scholarship and I submitted the supplemental Purdue scholarships application (the one due on Feb. 1) with an EFC of 0. I'm majoring in computer science, if that matters.
3109ag	-54274	1427856173	Purdue	Do transfer credits count towards being eligible to buy a parking permit as a incoming freshman?	To clarify, when I say "transfer credits", I mean Ivy Tech community college credit. I've looked through how many credits I'll actually get (because Purdue doesn't accept all of the "classes" I took) and it looks like I'll have over 30. I got those credits through dual credit classes. I'm also a new incoming student for Fall 2015, not a transfer student. Would I be eligible to straight up buy a parking permit before the October freshman parking permit lottery?

In addition, how much storage do I need (i.e. 128 v. 256 v. 512)?I don't really want a tablet masquedering as a laptop (a la MS Surface). I don't care for touchscreens (why would anyone want one?). I'm open to either Windows and Macs laptops. However: my DIY desktop runs Windows 8 and I'm not liking it. Windows is clearly made for touchscreens now. It's not intolerable, but I strongly prefer Windows 7. The Windows 8 start "menu" is awful. I definitely don't want the Macbook (the 1-port version) nor the Macbook Air. I am open to the Macbook Pro though. I'm also strongly considering the Thinkpad X1 Carbon. 
336rur	-54274	1429494783	Purdue	Advice on taking Calculus 1 or 2 as an incoming freshman who did well in AP Calculus AB?	I'm going to be majoring in CS, which requires going up to Calculus 3 and a linear algebra course at minimum. My HS's AP Calculus AB teacher wasn't a particularly good one. However, **I will receive direct credit for Calculus 1 at Purdue (MA 16500) since my AP Calculus AB class is dual credit via a regional campus. I'm going to get an 'A' in that class and therefore on my Purdue transcript.**My dilemma is that I'm not sure if I should retake Calculus 1 or go straight into Calculus 2. I looked over [past years' MA 16500 final exams](https://www.math.purdue.edu/academic/courses/oldexams/) and I can answer most of the questions, except for the ones involving:* series * ellipses and hyperbolas (focuses, vertices, etc.)* inscribed shapes ([such as #16 on the 2012 final](http://www.math.purdue.edu/academic/files/courses/oldexams/16500FE-F2012.pdf))My teacher allows my class unlimited usage of calculators (both graphing and scientific) on every assignment/quiz/test/exam. Because of that, I've used my calculator as something of a crutch in the sense that I didn't bother to memorize the unit circle (or memorized how to derive it); therefore I couldn't tell you what sin(pi/2) is (I do know that pi/2 is 90 degrees though). During Precalculus/Trigonometry, I remembered it. So, I shouldn't have that much trouble re-memorizing it. I also used to know everything about ellipses and hyperbolas in Algebra 2. I think I'm pretty good with derivatives and integrals (the two major themes of Calculus 1). I'm not sure why it gets taught in AB calculus, but I know most of the stuff about 'revolving the intersection of two functions around an arbitrary axis to find the volume'.

I am, for sure, going to open up a checking account at my college's credit union (Purdue Federal Credit Union). I would like to open up a second account so I'm not too reliant on one bank. Particularly since my nearest relative would be NYC whileas I would be in Indiana (so, I can't get that instant, in-person cash bailout; nor any other instant cash without some absurd fees a la Moneygram or Western Union).I'm currently considering: Capital One 360 (the adult version) and Charles SchwabAnyone have any thoughts (including any banks not listed)? Some details: don't really care about foreign exchange fees (I am going to be abroad for about a week soon, but I won't spend a meaningful amount; I can eat PFCU's 0.80% forex fee), ATM fees are mostly meaningless due to PFCU having ATMs on campus (and ATMs everywhere via the coop network), and interest rates are meaningless (my average balance isn't going to be anywhere near high enough to generate a meaningful amount of interest).And also, I'm not eligible for USAA and the like since no one in my family's is/was in the military.

2nh376	-54314	1417006959	soccerspirits	Defense line with zibroi?	I understand that the mira, mimi combo with kei is really strong and almost immortal if the right stones are equiped. And a extra character to reduce even more damage or heal hp.But what makes zibroi so good? He doesn't have as much damage reduction as kei so even if he gets healed he wont be as immortal as kei is.Thinking about this my solution is to have someone else tank all the damage. And just using zibroi for his bloodsucking aura.But who do I use to tank the damage with? I cant think of anyone else who could tank as much damage as kei.

2rd0zx	-54314	1420426312	soccerspirits	Help making a mono thunder team.	So I currently have this team that helps me get to colosseum 30:Veronica - Valkia - BladeEden - Lynbell - HildegardJuno - Mimi - VictoriaZibroiI'm using zibroi's vampiric aura which gives hp by the amount of damage I do.Juno increases crit rate for Victoria. And has an active heal.Victoria increases hp and attack by 10% for each crit. Max 50%. Which also has effect on the vampiric aura and mimi's coexistence.I know that its a bit unusual defence line but it works since victoria can take quite some damage because of being a defender,My question is:Which thunder players should I get and why?I think I will need to focus on Bell and Cynthia. And I will need to kick out Lynbell and Valkia.Well I'm a bit confused myself. I don't think thunder has great defenders at all... Bell is not a defender either, but a leader. I'm not sure if she can sustain the damage like my victoria does now.

Her reflex buff will make it unable to counterattack her and she decreases 15% hp in position when attacked. She is a defender hence 25% decrease in inflicted damage. She also has stealing capabilities.Eden will increase her defense with another 30% and decrease another 10% damage in position.Hildegard will break the line.Also does anyone has an idea of jury's evolution materials?

Sometimes accordion, sometimes a fiddle, usually a brass or woodwind instrument is in there somewhere, stand up bass, guitar. Mostly as a Duo or TrioIs there a name to this style? or a time period? or artist I can reference?  The only music I can compare it to is La vie en Rose, the soundtrack of the movie UP or the music you hear in the movie Mightnight in Paris.

12dsso	-54361	1351658034	Winnipeg	Anyone know of a good seamstress that can make a wedding dress?	I am getting married next fall, and I would like a custom made dress, as I can't find what I'm looking for in stores. It wouldn't have a lot of detail, and would be fairly straight forward to make, but I want someone who knows what they're doing. I have not been impressed by what I have seen so far, save for one lady, but she is unfortunately moving out of province.
17gqai	-54361	1359420525	Winnipeg	Anyone downtown missing an orange cat?	I have seen an orange cat (possibly male, as I thought I saw him spray), downtown near The Fort Garry Hotel a couple times now. He comes out around 3 am. I would love to take him in, but I already have 2 cats.

As per the usual here in Winnipeg, the kid was released on a promise to appear. I'm sure there'll be some bullshit about him coming from a bad family or having FASD. I'm also sure he'll be setting more fires.
1khg70	-54361	1376656647	wedding	Afraid of being cheap...	I have a friend who is getting married tomorrow, and I'm not sure how much money to put in the card. She is having an early morning wedding, a brunch with just some light breakfast foods, and that's it. There is no alcohol or music allowed. We also have to drive about an hour out of town to get there. Is $50 too little to give from my boyfriend and I?
1ms79z	-54361	1379692032	wedding	I can't be the only one...tell me some of your wedding horror stories!	So, our wedding in next Saturday, the 28th. We've literally had nothing but problems with the entire thing so far, and I'm beyond stressed out. I half wondered if this was some kind of sign that I shouldn't be marrying my fiancé, but if that's what the universe wants...TOO BAD!So, brief summary of problems:-Been through 3 photographers, and had several cancel appointments at the last minute or just not show up.-3 different bakers/bakeries tried to do what we wanted for a cake, and failed miserably. (For reference, it's the very first picture: http://tinyurl.com/n4gbr7x)-Met with numerous seamstresses to make me a wedding dress, as I couldn't find anything I liked in the store (I'm fat, so I guess that's why it was hard for me). Finally picked a seamstress who did amazing stuff. She took my measurements, and started making the dress. I lost 40 pounds, she re-took them. I go to try on the dress for the final fitting 3 weeks ago, and I haaated it. It was too big in most spots, and she didn't design it the way I wanted...I provided her a ton of pictures. She said it was supposed to fit the way it did.-Went for a food tasting with the caterer, and it was AMAZING. Again, about 2 - 3 weeks ago, the wedding co-coordinator tells us she isn't working with that caterer anymore because of an argument over pricing, and that she didn't like his service anymore.-This week, we get the bill from the co-coordinator, and there are charges on there for things we didn't originally agree too, or didn't know we'd be charged extra for.-And finally, last night the co-coordinator tells us that the backdrop she was making for us got ruined.I know it sounds like we might be the "couple from hell," but we're honestly not. We're not demanding at all, and have tried to be really flexible. I think we just have bad luck.

So, I used to wear makeup everyday, but a few years ago, I decided to basically give up on myself...I'm fat, all I wear is sweatpants and t-shirts, and I put on makeup maybe twice a year. I just stopped caring. I'm at a better place in my life now, so I figured it's about time to start caring again. So, I decided to start with fixing my face. I've never been particularly happy with my eyebrows...I plucked them so much once upon a time, I had to draw them in. Even then they were shitty. I've used a brown eyeshadow from MAC along with one of their angled brushes to fill them in, but I can't ever get the shape right. So many people have pretty and neat angled eyebrows...I want to, too. I've looked at tutorials online, and in a couple books, but I just can't do them right. So, I've come to see if you experienced individuals out there can help...please?Pictures of my eyebrows with no makeup, etc.: http://imgur.com/a/bpSx7

Many are being found with severe frostbite, or worse. There was a cat found the other day that was literally frozen to the ground under a car. It was saved, thankfully.Anyway, long story short, Winnipeg Pet Rescue Shelter is needing donations badly. You can donate by phone, in person, or online at their website: http://www.petrescueshelter.com/Today's Sun article: http://www.winnipegsun.com/2014/02/11/worst-winter-ever-for-winnipeg-no-kill-shelter(And no, I am in no way affiliated with the shelter.

My husband and I both play the game, and I think he's maybe ONCE rolled and got a cat he already had. Me, on the other hand....I just rolled 4 times, and got 2 Shaman Cats (which I already had in the first place), and a Viking Cat which I already had too. The other roll was Swimmer Cat. Do I just have shitty luck? I kind of wondered too if maybe the type of operating system mattered somehow? I have an iPhone, husband has an Android.Sorry for being ranty.

Now, as silly as it is, one of the only things that's stopping me from switching to an Android is that I don't think it's possible to transfer my Battle Cats save from iOS to Android. Anyone have any idea if it can be done? I'd really rather not start all over again.Thanks for your help.

So, as part of a Reddit Gift Exchange, I wanted to send my giftee something that she can't get in the UK (Sheffield). I'd ask her directly, but I was hoping to surprise her. The only 2 things I can think of are Reese's Pieces/Cups or Ketchup chips, but I'm not sure if that's something that is already available there....I've looked around online, but everything I've read is from years ago.

21cx69	-54364	1395783886	worldbuilding	Avalanche: world building using a calendar and introducing time as a constraint	Hi to all. I'm new on Reddit, so I'm not sure I'll have it right the first time. You tell me.I've been working on a setting and 'adventures modules' for tabletop role playing game for some time. My 'world', Avalanche, is built around a very specific design that strongly introduces the notion of time in the world. It tries to produce the effect of a living world.Avalanche presents a vast region, his main protagonists, organizations, legends and a complete twelve weeks calendar relating how the world advances. And your players won't be able to do everything. They'll have to make choices.The final product looks like some kind of a storyboard, ready for you to complete. It is built so players could go and really change the world, and still leave in the hands of the DM a product he/she can still use.Two resources I'd like to share with you if you want to learn more:- An actual 70 pages extract of Avalanche: http://www.existanc3.com/stuff/ExiStanc3-Avalanche_an_extract.pdf- Our promotional video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO9Vpf_LtDo&amp;feature=youtu.beI'd be very interested to talk about the design, the world building around the project. I'm always looking for patterns and I'm very interested in new approach to create setting and plots.

21g11i	-54364	1395865742	Fantasy	Avalanche: an illustrated novel set in dark fantasy world.	Let me introduce you to Avalanche, an epic campaign set in a familiar universe. It brings us what we love from fantasy - elves, dwarves, monsters and adventures - and it does so in a deep setting that resembles the Renaissance. It is a dark world where the likes of Sauron and Ganondorf are victorious, where the winds of change are coming to a society standing on archaic principles, and where stories have the feel of spice on sands, and the heroic dropping of the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom. [For an actual extract of Avalanche, see this pdf.](http://www.existanc3.com/stuff/ExiStanc3-Avalanche_an_extract.pdf)[If you want to learn more, we have this teaser video]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO9Vpf_LtDo&amp;feature=youtu.beAvalanche is presented somehow as a storyboard. Because of its specific structure, I decided to use a [let's called it] 'vanilla' setting. So, the real challenge for me what to come up with a very coherent 'living world', developing five stories lines along a calendar.Some writers uses excel or MS Project. I'm working along those lines.What do you think?Does the coherence of time takes a lot of space in your writing?Do you plan a lot ahead in your writing (thus, using some kind of storyboard)?

Have had several with the older casters I was more familiar with but have decided to start testing the new ones - eVyros and Issy as this is likely the pairing I'll be using going forward.Played an eVyros game last night on Vassal vs eFeora and... probably one of the most fun games I've ever had with Ret; chaining up for the Griffon bullet was great and although the Menoth player was able to trash three Griffons at once from poor placement, the list felt like it had a lot of solid options.Anyone else have a lot of eVryos Griffon spam experience?

I've installed a bunch of stuff from SynoCommunity: Transmission, Sickbeard, NZBget, etc. Does the DSM update preserve those packages, or do I have to install them again? What about the data files under the app folder?For example, Transmission puts every .torrent file I've downloaded here, and I obviously don't want to lose them:    /volume2/@appstore/transmission/var/torrents/Is there anything else I should be worrying about? I find this sysadmin work unpleasant, and I value stability over features. So ideally everything would just work with a minimum of tweaks.**Edit**: OK, I did it. All is well.

But in the last couple of months, the charging process has been stopping before the phone is fully charged. It happens like this:* Carefully put phone on charger* Blinky light comes on -- OK* Go to bed* Wake up. Light not blinking. N4 is at 50% battery.At first I blamed my case, but removing it didn't help at all. The phone only seems to "charge" for about 15 minutes: I tried it again this morning while I was taking a shower, and it had stopped charging by the time I got out.Has anyone else had this problem? Is the N4 to blame, or the charger?
2nthbv	-54377	1417321904	techsupport	PC randomly reboots during heavy GPU use (games etc)	A few weeks ago I installed a new power supply (Corsair CX600M) and video card (a GTX 770). Since then, my PC has started randomly rebooting while I'm playing games. This typically happens after only 5-15 minutes of use, so it's basically unusable for any gaming or 3D stuff.The CPU and memory seem solid -- they handle stress tests for 35+ mins with no problems. But when I do a stress test involving the GPU, the computer shuts off in under 10 mins. Every time. The shutoffs have continued even after replacing the power supply (the store gave me a brand new one), and after switching to a different video card for comparison (I borrowed an 8800 GTX). I've done various other troubleshooting steps too, see below for details.The question is: **what do I do next**? RMA the motherboard? I think the CPU and RAM are OK, since they work fine in isolation. And every other component I've either replaced or swapped out already.**Specs*** CPU: Intel Core i7-3770 @ 3.40GHz (SR0PK)* Motherboard: Gigabyte GA B75M-D3H (rev 1.0), BIOS F15* Memory: 16GB Corsair vengeance (4x4GB CMZ16GX3M4A1600C9)* Video card: Zotac Geforce GTX 770 4GB (ZT-70304-10P)* Power supply: Corsair CX600M 600W* OS: Windows 8.1**Tests I ran*** memtest86 = no issues after 60+ mins* Prime95 = no issues after 35+ mins* [OCCT](http://www.ocbase.com/) CPU test = no issues after 30+ mins* OCCT GPU or PSU test = PC shuts off in &lt; 8 mins :(**Troubleshooting steps I tried*** Replaced the PSU. (Got a brand-new one, same model -- CX600M). * Tested every RAM stick by itself.* Tested every RAM slot.* Tried underclocking RAM as low as it would go.* Tested both PCIe ports (x4 and x16).* Tested 3 different video cards: GTX 650, 8800 GTX (dies), GTX 770 (dies)**Edit:** so all 3 video cards eventually cause the PC to shut off. The GTX650 survives for longer than the other 2, but they all shut off in the end.** Edit 2:** solved. I finally took my PC to a shop. They determined that the PSU was faulty -- in other words, I had gotten **two** defective CX600M's in a row. Yeah.
2nv1b8	-54377	1417372541	pcgamingtechsupport	PC randomly reboots during gaming/GPU use [x-post from /r/techsupport]	About 3 weeks ago, I installed a new power supply and video card: Corsair CX600M and a GTX 770. Since then, my PC has started randomly rebooting while I'm playing 3D games. This happens after only 5-30 minutes of play, so it's basically unusable for games.The exact length of time depends on the game, but using a GPU stress tester like Furmark, the PC lasts less than 10 mins before rebooting. The CPU and memory seem solid: I can run CPU-only stress tests for 35+ mins with no problems. But when the GPU enters the picture, things go to hell fast.I replaced the power supply (the store gave me a brand new one) -- didn't help. I replaced the 770 with a 8800 GTX -- didn't help either. The only thing that **does** help is installing my old GTX 650, whch runs fine for hours on end.At this point I'm blaming the motherboard, since almost every other component has been replaced/swapped out. But I can't explain why the motherboard would tolerate a 650, but not 770 or 8800. Advice?**Edit:** I was mistaken. It shuts off when using any of the video cards. The GTX 650 just takes a few minutes longer to trigger the problem.**Edit 2:** **solved**. I finally took my PC to a shop. They determined that the PSU was defective. Meaning I got 2 faulty power supplies in a row -- both Corsair CX600M's. What are the chances?**Specs*** CPU: Intel Core i7-3770 @ 3.40GHz (SR0PK)* Motherboard: Gigabyte GA B75M-D3H (rev 1.0), BIOS F15* Memory: 16GB Corsair vengeance (4x4GB CMZ16GX3M4A1600C9)* Video card: Zotac Geforce GTX 770 4GB (ZT-70304-10P)* Power supply: Corsair CX600M 600W* OS: Windows 8.1**Tests I ran*** memtest86 = no issues after 60+ mins* Prime95 = no issues after 35+ mins* [OCCT](http://www.ocbase.com/) CPU test = no issues after 30+ mins* OCCT GPU or PSU test = PC shuts off in &lt; 10 mins :(**Troubleshooting steps*** Replaced the PSU.

In particular:1. **Anything that uses magic kicks my ass.** I had a hard time defeating Snowy Granius the battlemage, ordinary Dwarven Spectres, and even Spider Centurions when they use that ranged attack (poisonbloom)? I have to run away and rest after almost every fight in a dungeon.2. **Dark Brotherhood assassins.** These fuckers show up while I'm resting -- so I'm usually low on health to begin with -- and just destroy me. I've killed a bunch already but they're getting harder. The last one had a spider dagger that drained all my health in 2-3 hits.Am I doing something wrong, or is the game supposed to be this hard?Stats:* Dunmer spellsword, level 4* Just finished Arkngthand lower level (for "Antabolis Informant" of the main quest)

I want to be able to browse my video library and play it back on the TV.Ideally the TV itself would handle this job. However...* I'm getting the impression that video container support is inconsistent across Smart TVs, and the playback software tends to be poor. My library is a hodgepodge of H.264/DivX/XVID in AVI and MKV containers, so this might be a problem.* The TV brand I'm looking at (Vizio E-series) is not DLNA certified, so I'm not sure if it'll work with Video Station.* My DiskStation can't handle any solution that requires transcoding on the NAS. (PPC CPU, no hardware video decoding)So will I need a set-top device or HTPC to do the actual browsing/decoding and feed HDMI to the TV, and keep the NAS as just a dumb file server?**How do folks in /r/synology solve this?****Edit:** oh god, there's a typo in the subject line and I can't fix it

Reading from internet but u are not here and see what's going onJoshua says:I'm trying to get some information, Joshua says:I'm trying to get some information, Also I've found you keep asking the same questions about 3-4 times.

If there is ever going to be an IoT universe, data has to be easy, cheap, and awesome. There are enough people upset with current offerings to take action and find alternative solutions. Unfortunately there aren't any alternatives in most areas. We'd like to band people together and figure out how we can make that change happen. So, what would be your ideal internet experience?[Edit]Just to clarify, What would an ideal world look like when connecting/using the internet?Background: A lot of us are fed up with cellular and data services (comcast/at&amp;t). This is not the world we wanted when we were growing up and we would like to see a fundamental change. In fact, I believe the only way progress can be made is through a change delivered by and for the people.

I’m working on a new project called Sink or Swim.I’ve got about three months ([3.7months](http://sosuniverse.com/budget)) of runway before I go **broke and homeless.** I’ve decided to document on video my journey going from nothing to hopefully having a functional product people will want to buy. **Here are the rules:*** **I can’t get a job.** I have to build something that makes money or die trying.* Any donations given to the project go **directly to building product.** I can’t use donations for rent or food. **What the audience gets by donating:*** Ownership - anyone that donates ([Patreon](http://bit.ly/1IUlhnU)) over $5 bucks a month will be entered into a pool for 7% ownership over any successful product I build. * Custom business tools - I’ll be building tools to help me accomplish the things I need quicker. I’m a programmer building tools for business, etc and you’ll get exclusive first access to those tools.* eBooks - I’m writing and illustrating about my experience and insights into startups. You’ll get these free.* How-tos - I’ll be writing cookbooks to help recreate any successes I’ve had.* Analytics - All the insights and understanding on how things work and how to tap into every channel possible.Here is my landing page (feedback appreciated): [http://sosuniverse.com/](http://sosuniverse.com/)I’d like to be able to tap into the wisdom of the /r/entrepreneur members to help guide me along the way. I want the collective community to be my mentor. I’m knowledgeable in certain areas, but could really use some experts to target my weak spots. I’ll be checking in twice a week updating and probably asking for more advice from the community. Thank you all. I’d be absurdly humbled if anyone responded, or liked, or shared what I’m doing. Embarking on this journey is super scary, and I’m all alone right now. I’m basically open sourcing my life, crowd sourcing my wisdom, and crowd funding the future. Thoughts? Feedback? No risk no reward, right?
3g1v1b	-54383	1438894747	Entrepreneur	Going broke and homeless to live for my dream.	Hey everyone!I'm going broke and homeless in ~~three months~~ 87 days, unless I can build something people want and love enough to pay me for.I have two rules.1. I can't get a job. (That's cheating.)2. All pledges go to product.Here is the project page: http://sosuniverse.com/ All of my data is open and available on that page. I've got an engineering background and I've built a couple of startups in the past.I'd like your help. I've been a long time lurker, soaking up everything on here from failure to success. I want to get the community involved in what I'm doing and make it a huge part of the reason we make this effort a success.I'm going to hold an informal weekly google hangout where I update everyone on progress, analytics, etc. and would love if you gave me feedback.If you'd like to be a mentor/advisor please reach out to me.

I’ve given myself less than three months (that’s all the runway I have) to build products people want and love, and I’m going to be documenting and recording every step through a show called “Sink or Swim.”Once I build the first couple of apps (two mvps are already built), I’m going to interview other entrepreneurs, investors, and experts to see how I can take these products further. We do well and go further when we have community, and I hope to tap into that love here on r/entrepreneur.

If you have recommendations on people that I can reach out to please leave them here.Background on me: I’m a founder with technical expertise, have launched a couple of startups and apps. The last app I built was a social network with a lean budget that now has over ~70k users.Beyond broke and homeless: I’m not going back into the workforce. If I have to sleep in the streets and code with free internet at starbucks, I’ll make something of my dream or die trying.For anyone wondering the first two apps are channelpie.com and networkpie.com, and I’m now in the middle of building my third app.In exchange for any advice I will help whoever however I can, and will also add you to the awesome list! http://sosuniverse.com/peopleMore about me and what I'm doing here: http://sosuniverse.com/TL;DR: Money low, Dreams high, Do or die, Halp.

3hzrz0	-54383	1440267759	Entrepreneur	Have an opportunity to start getting press but need some feedback	I can reach out to my journalist friends and get some attention to my latest product BUT:1. Since the target demo for this are creators/makers I worry that most of them might be at burning man and won't see the news2. It might be easier to get coverage because it is burning manThoughts?
3ip6ld	-54383	1440745572	Entrepreneur	In the case I go broke and homeless while building product.	I’m one month into the three months I’ve given myself to build products people want and love — while going broke and homeless.The hardest part of this is the very real chance that I will go broke and homeless if I don’t meet the deadline. I have pretty strict rules that also make livelihood a bit more difficult.1. I can’t get a job. No contracting, no consulting. All money has to come from product.2. I can only use pledged money for building product (no food, rent)3. I can’t just crash at a friend’s place.4. In the event I do go homeless, I can’t go back into the workforce. I have to live and build product while homeless. This is do or die.With all of this in mind, I’ve begun doing a bit of research on what resources I have and what I’ll need to prepare for homelessness.**The Gear**The first thing on my mind is what will I need to survive daily life while building. There are things about myself that I’d like to maintain.My mind immediately thinks of these things: Clothing, Personal Hygiene, Backpack, Footwear, Storage, Transportation, Starvation.**Clothing**Materials should be light weight, and easy to wash in a sink if I must. Jogging shorts, a pair of pants, socks, and a couple of t-shirts should suffice. My main concern is finding material that will dry quickly by just wringing them with my hands. I’ll then need plastic bags to store these items once dry.I have a leather jacket, and a light Marmot jacket in the event of inclement weather.**Personal Hygiene**I should have enough money after selling all of my personal effects to afford a Tech Shop membership and a Gym membership for a couple of months.I can shower at the Planet Fitness Gym and still maintain some exercise regimen. I’ll need flip flops, and can probably shower in my gym clothes to save wash time. I can also brush my teeth and use the facilities there.**Footwear**I run 3–4 miles a day so I’ll need a comfortable pair of running shoes. I’m lucky enough that I live and work in a city where most of the time you can get away with super casual dress and still be taken seriously. I’m unsure of what to do with my other dress shoes.**Storage**I’d like to be able to keep a small crate of things I can access when I need to. I have suits, button downs, and other things I might need to look presentable. I’d also like to keep some of my personal journals that contain my past design and product ideas. I’m unaware of any crate storage services, but maybe my good friends will have a spot.Backpack storage. I’ll want to have a very low profile backpack so I don’t actually look transient, but big enough to hold my everyday essentials. Probably something black, but I’ll try and copy what the rest of the tech nerds in the area are using so I can fit in.I’ll most likely get a PO Box for any deliveries.**Starvation**This is something I haven’t solved. I won’t actually have access to a kitchen, and I’m not sure how I feel about using something like NoiseBridge (Hackerspace) for cooking. I’ll want to stick with something high calorie, but compact. I can carry meal bars in my bag, but will need some place to keep more, unless I can get a weekly subscription of bars so I won’t have to keep a big supply somewhere.This plan doesn’t sound sustainable, but I’ll figure something out once I’m put in the situation. I’m resourceful, but I’ll take hints so drop me a comment if you have tips.With all of this planning, I do often find myself sometimes getting nostalgic over leaving my first solo place in San Francisco. I’ve been living at this location for three years now. There are so many memories here both beautiful and sad that make up a huge part of my history. It’s bitter sweet and I’m going to definitely miss it, but in the end there isn’t much time to reminisce. Onwards and upwards to bigger and better.

1f6z6g	-54401	1369740579	MakeupAddiction	Liquid eyeliner that does not stick on upper eyelid?	I have this problem that most eyeliners stick on my upper eyelid. For example [this artdeco eyeliner](http://i.beautylish.co/S_JJQqy0eaumaqavt3RbywD6AXc/bb_p-f9/artdeco-long-lasting-liquid-liner.jpg) sticks, although it's not the cheapest and it's easy to use and does not dry out fast. On the other hand, [this cheap H&amp;M eyeliner](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ogIS3oMsazM/TXN2-XpKSCI/AAAAAAAAAHU/7CLVT29fWS0/s1600/liquid+eyeliner+2.95.jpg) does not stick, but is sometimes really messy and it's hard to get the perfect line.So, can you recommend any good liquid eyeliners that are NOT sticky?PS I live in Europe and don't have any big makeup stores nearby.

1n42im	-54401	1380126835	Dermatology	What might this skin rash be?	The rash started last week and at first looked like mosquito bites, [this](http://imgur.com/xkhTbYG&amp;WTwsP4l#0) was the first one I discovered, then [that](http://imgur.com/xkhTbYG&amp;WTwsP4l#1), when [those](http://imgur.com/t5mCQcn) on my legs started appearing, I knew that they couldn't be mosquito bites. [It's quite blurry picture](http://imgur.com/M4P2OZB) but one had a "tail" that kind of looked like blood vessel, but wasn't. So, for three days more rash appeared, on wednesday it stopped and started healing, then I had a weekend at my parent's house, came back on sunday and on monday morning the rash was back. Some mosquito-bites-look-a-like thingys here and there. I thought that maybe I had some insects that were biting me at night, so I poisoned my bedroom with insecticide, washed all my sheets at high temperature, but still had [new rash](http://imgur.com/ZSTjNvI) in the morning. And this afternoon, after school, [again](http://imgur.com/4JIUchg) appeared one with a "tail".I have absolutely no clue what it might be, maybe any of you can identify my awful itchy skin rash? I'd be really grateful, cause it might take a few months before I could see a dermatologist, as the lines are really long.

In summer my skin is even and I hardly ever have red disturbing pimples or visible acne scars. So "better" in that way.

I've read the wiki and the  guide to getting your first fountain pen, but I'm still in struggle. Now that I've done some research, I feel like Pilot's Metropolitan is the best I could find in my price range (http://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Collection-Fountain-91107/dp/B009X9Z2FW - does this seem like a good deal?). PS! I live in Europe and it would be great if I could find one with faster shipping, but things tend to cost more here and since I'm a student who has to pay her own rent, I prefer not to spend any extra money on convenience.Oh, and I also visited a local store where they had Regal pens. The cheapest one was 10,40€, which is a nice price, but I'm not sure about the model. But the shop assistant was weird, so I prefer not to go back there if I don't have to (she told me that she would never buy a pen that expensive, what a great selling tecnique, right?)Sorry for the long story, but now you know my price range (the cheaper the better, but still decent quality) and maybe you can help me find a good value pen that ships to Europe.

roqdx	-54412	1333325475	motorcycles	Need a little help here guys. I need to switch out the stock pipes and pedals on my 99 Shadow 1100 with these aftermarket Vance and Hines pipes and these pedals. 	I have pictures of the stock ones and the aftermarket parts on it. I need to know everything I have to do with installing the pipes. I should be able to do the pedals no problem. But I don't know if I have to do any kind of tuning on the engine or not because the Vance n Hines pipes are completely hollow. The bike's out at my grampa's shop right now because I have to do that and change out the thermo relay switch. My grampa has just about every tool imaginable so that's not a problem.

t00l1	-54420	1335807033	loseit	Today I looked in the mirror and smiled...	I've been subscribed (and lurking) for a few months, following your progress and silently cheering you all on, and I finally decided to post.Thank you! All of you. You have all inspired me and over the past two weeks I have been eating a low fat diet and walking every where (small steps, hey?) I recently had my gall bladder removed which made the low fat diet even more important but since I had already been on it, following all your tips and advice, it's been relatively easy.As the title says, today I looked in the mirror and smiled because after 8 years I have lost my double chin, my stomach doesn't hang down as much (a good inch or so) and I can walk to the local supermarket without getting out of breath (before my surgery). It has been hard of late to stick to healthy eating, being stuck indoors all the time, unable to walk far has really put me down but I keep coming here and reminding myself that you did it and so can I! I've lost roughly 8-10 pounds bringing me down to 71kg (11st 2).My goal is 60kg or 9st 4, this is meant to be a helthy weight for me, but I am personally going of what my shape is. I want a flat stomach and smaller thighs, I've already lost the double chin.I know this will be hard, but I know you are all here, in 6 weeks I will join a gym (have to wait for the all clear from my doctor) and will figure out what is best for me. But one last time thank you all for helping me without knowing it! Nicole x

This decision was made on no sleep, no food and I still thought it was a good idea to walk half a mile to go swim for 40 minutes then do cardio for another 40 before walking another mile to shop then another half mile to get some forms I needed. I was so proud that I'd managed to go the gym I still hadn't eaten anything but a banana, small amount of bran flakes and half a can of coke. I sat down in the One-Stop (Housing/Council tax) I started to feel dizzy, get my forms and make it 15 feet outside, next thing I'm lying down and someones called an ambulance....5 hour A&amp;E visit for fainting. According to the nurses I tried to leave and fell over just inside the door...embarrassed does not cover it.Any tips on how to avoid this again? I can't eat before I work out because I feel sick, as for the no sleep dick head neighbors got a stern warning not to party until 3.30am again.TL;DR - Fainted after the gym, want to avoid this again.

1ekzmj	-54420	1368895233	ChronicPain	Hello everybody!	Hello everyone!My name is nicole and I was pointed towards this subreddit by the lovely /u/thefaith1029.I suffer with [Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter_of_Oddi_dysfunction) and have done for the past year. I was officially given my diagnosis last November after 10 months of testing across two hospitals under seven different consultants. Finally, after transferring my care to the second hospital (whole other story regarding the first one) I got the help I needed.It's still a struggle as this illness is very rare over here in the UK and we only have two hospitals with a team able to properly deal with this. I live in constant pain and I'm prone to agonizing flare ups that stop me doing anything. I've collapsed in public a few times so I've stopped going out as no-one knows how to help and hospitals don't treat pain as a serious thing.My life is on hold until this all gets sorted but from what I heard from other sufferers sometimes this doesn't get better. I'm 22 and if this is my life from now on I don't know what the hell I'm going to do! I'm meeting up with a pain management team who treat cancer patients and sufferers of MS so hopefully that will be the life line I need right now. The hardest part of this is while not many things set off an attack every single pain killer I've come across, from paracetamol to morphine, leaves me agony which mean I can't take anything for any other health issue I might have. The only thing that does help, and I'm jealous of certain parts of the US right  now, is marijuana. On it, I'm calm and relatively pain free and if I have a flare up a massive hit just knocks me out and I wake up when its all over. Admittedly the munchies are having a negative effect on my waist line (not by much) but I'd rather buy new jeans that be in pain.Sorry to rant, but feel free to rant below too!

1g1wmu	-54420	1370881642	ChronicPain	[RANT] I'm sick of this...	This is going to take a lot out of me so please excuse any spelling mistakes. I'm 22 years old. On thursday last week I was admitted to the A&amp;E having the worst flare up I have ever suffered. I was reduced to screaming in pain while waiting for the paramedics to show up. I was finally taken to the royal liverpool hospital where I had to wait three hours for IV buscopan and five hours for entonox gas. The worst thing though, was the realisation that for the last six months those thought I was having during attacks, the ones that said 'death would be easier' that I had quickly and firmly pushed aside were no longer back burner thoughts. I'm so sick of being ill. I hate that I can't do anything that I used to, I can't anywhere alone, I can't go out of a weekend, I can't even plan to do anything just in case I have a hospital/GP/Tribunal appointment to attend.The pain is unbearable and I have NO warning to when the next attack will happen, I can go from how I feel everyday (about a 2/3 on the pain scale) to crippling agony that bring my whole world crashing down onto the one spot of pain in my side. I an finding it harder and harder to keep positive these days. I've already spoken to my GP, I've been put on Citalopram 20mg and I'm waiting to hear from a counsellor. My partner knows and is understanding/helping as best he can but as horrible as it is to say, he has no effing clue what I'm going through and bugs the ever loving shit out of me when he tells me I'm going to be okay. (Yes he knows this)I'm tearing my hair out and don't know what I can do while I'm waiting for the counsellor to get back to me.

I won my appeal against a decision to take me off ESA (Employment support allowance) back in January as I was told 'an illness like mine didn't qualify'. I've spent the last 9 months going back and forth, sending in more and more medical data and letters from my consultants and finally it's over!I don't know if this is appropriate for this sub but I just wanted to share and let others know that there is hope! 
1ysi3r	-54420	1393246678	Agoraphobia	New here, I've started to panic at the idea of going out alone.	Hi, like the title says, I've started to panic at the idea of going out alone. Let me start by saying I'm sick. I have two illnesses that stop me from going anywhere by myself (Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction and Arthritis) and another that just adds to it in cold weather (Raynauds), the first illness can cause collapses and immense pain and I've also started to have black outs and dizzy spells.I don't expect to be able to go out alone properly before this year is done. But I used to be able to go to the shop at the end of my road and back without to much bother. The other day I ran out of electric (meter) and needed to go to the shop and I panicked. When I realised I would have to go out I started shaking, crying and I got very dizzy. I called my dad and he got my electric for me but it's never happened like that before, now just thinking about having to go out without someone is terrifying. I'm near tears just writing this because it's making me think about it.I don't know if anyone here can help but I don't know where else to go x Thank you for reading x 
1yznl1	-54420	1393424769	nursing	Hello, as requested by /u/phidelt649, I suffer with Chronic Pain, AMA about ER from my side.	Hello, I'm Nicole and I'm 22 years old. In the last 24 months I have been diagnosed with [Sphincter of Oddi Type III](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter_of_Oddi_dysfunction), arthritis in my left knee, Raynauds Phenomenon and I have had my gallbladder removed. I am under investigation for some black outs I've been having.My SOD mean I cannot eat certain foods, not just fatty, no more alcohol, I'm also now 'allergic' to analgesia from paracetamol to morphine and some antibiotics. I spend everyday in pain 4/10 and during and attack (when the sphincter spasms or seizes) it goes immediately to between 8/10 to more commonly 10/10 pain levels. I am regularly in ER's due to my pain or blackouts. Feel free to AMA! x

(my board doesn't do sata3 so i dont know how fast an SSD will be for me)My other option was to bump up the ram to 8-16gigs because im a multitasker and do a lot with photo and audio/video.My last idea was swapping out the 810 phenom with the 965/975 BE. everything is compatible and i think it's the best chip my board can actually use.im attempting to keep this upgrade at or around $100 (in the case of an ssd, i'll bump it up a tad more)thoughts?

uhcpo	-54427	1338656813	AskReddit	How do I overcome my fear of being unsuccessful?	It's my biggest fear in life. I'm already 30 years old but I'm in a dead-end job with no real education (aside from high school and trade certification in my field). I'm divorced with no assets to my name... I'm afraid I'll never truly be successful in life. I almost feel like it's too late to do something.  I know going back to school is an option but the fear of not doing well or not getting a good job after is keeping me from just jumping in and doing it. This fear of never being successful trickles down into other aspects of my life and I never end up giving 100% into anything I do because I've convinced myself that I will never see great results. I have the hunger for success, but something is holding me back.So Reddit, how do I overcome this fear I have that I will never be successful?

umy0r	-54427	1338938920	iphone	new iphone user: issues with camera?	maybe i'm just used to the razor sharp, very vivid photos that came off of my samsung galaxy phone...  but im having a hard time getting my iphone4 to take nice crisp and sharp pictures. it's the standard iphone4 (not the S model, 16gb model)it's not that old, maybe 3months.. (i've had it for 3 days now, traded my samsung for it)it seems that no matter what i do, no matter what the situation or the lighting conditions the camera just refuses to take a nice sharply focused picture.  it does if i'm up close but anything more than 10 ft away, regardless if i spot/touch focus or if i hold to lock focus, the images look like they just aren't sharp or almost hazy. photos that are less than 10 feet away look razor sharp.am i doing something wrong? is this just the way this camera is? im not looking to move to a 4S and im looking to keep this phone for a little while but unfortunatly it also functions as my primary camera for the time being.any tips?**EDIT:** if figured something out... if i let the camera do it's own focus and take a shot the photos don't come out well. if i hold to lock af/ae the shots come out ultra sharp.is it a software bug maybe?

vs8hw	-54427	1340950252	KingstonOntario	anyone interested in a fragrance swap?	first let me start off by saying that 'JamesGray' gave me the go-ahead to make this, as im sure it's not exactly the kind of thing you would normally see in this subreddit. (im sure i'll be down voted immediately)im looking for other fragrance aficionados who may be interested in having a "fragrance swap"ideally this would be for setting up any other members to trade fragrances/colognes/perfumes that they've bought but for whatever reason dont like. i thought this would be a great way for anyone to offer up what they have to trade and see if there is any interest.there's no concern for getting ripped off in the mail or whatever the case may be because the trades can be made in person!  i should reiterate that this is for trading and NOT for selling. i'll start!i have a nearly unused 125ml (the biggest one) bottle of authentic Jean Paul Gautier "Le Male" it's been used three times so the bottle is about 95+% full.  i would like to swap for another bottle that is similarly considered 'higher end'.  i like this one a lot and the three whole times i wore it i got complimented many times, however i dont feel it suits me.this one normally sells from $80 and up to $125 depending on the store so a 100ml bottle in trade would be the best for me.what im looking for:one of the following in trade* L'eau D'Issey (pour homme) by Issey Miyake* Dolce Gabbana pour Homme* One Million by Paco Rabanne * A*Men (pure malt) by Thierry Mugler* L'Homme by Yves Saint Laurent* White by Lacoste (the newest one)* green irish tweed by creedim open to others, but these are my wants.feel free to add your own trades and what you are after and maybe another local redditor has what you are looking for! remember, no selling just trading!**tl;dr fragrance collectors, trade fragrances with locals!**
wfedr	-54427	1342069889	applehelp	new macbook pro user, newbie help appreciated	i googled but couldnt really find exactly the info i needed so im trying here. sorry if this is very basic but im still learning.i recently picked up a mid 2011 macbook pro from the local classified ads.I've been a long time pc/windows user and i know my way around a windows machine but have very limited experience with a mac. I'm trying to wrap my head around a few things and was wondering if i could ask some "newbie" questions.first of all, the original owner didn't include a recover/install disc. how do i go about reinstalling a fresh OS? on my windows pc i just put in the disc and tell the computer to format the hard drive and away i go. is there a way to do similar on the macbook?i have 10.7.4 currently installed and just want to do a fresh install of that. i think the current is 10.7.2 then i would have to update after that. i tried to purchase through the app store but it seems like i can't make a dvd from that file. am i missing something? is it easier to just buy a dvd from the apple store? the original owner is still set up as admin and i want to basically set it up fresh so that his info/apple id is gone and mine is in place.second thing is, I'm not a huge fan of iTunes. i never have been. on windows i used foobar or winamp exclusively. i use iTunes to load music and sync my iPhone 4 but i don't use it for anything else. is there a good alternative audio player that i can use? something simple and easy to use that can play .flac files as well as mp3s?third thing, I'm very used to the control i have in windows 7. i like to designate a single folder as mine and then my own subfolders but it seems like (specifically with music) that OSX wants to sort things for me.  i'll use music as the example.. i have a folder labeled albums. i want to play those songs but NOT have additional copies in another folder designated by iTunes. it seems like iTunes just makes a copy of that song in its own folder. i don't want duplicates wasting hard disc space. is there a way around this? (perhaps an alternative audio player?)lastly.. until i can perform a fresh install the original owner is still set as admin and his apple id are still in tact. i want to be able to buy apps in the app store (such as photoshop for example) but it won't let me install/purchase things under my apple id because his is still the primary, and he has previously purchased one or two of the same ones. the app store prevents me from buying them. I'm not sure why this is. maybe because its still tied to his apple id?besides a fresh install, is there a way around this until i CAN do a full fresh install?thanks! and i apologize for being a newbie.

(I'm in canada)  I'm stuck in a job that i don't like and only stay because of the money (which isn't even that good, just enough to sustain me with the massive debt i have) I'm up to my eyeballs in debt and can't seem to get free , no matter what i do or how i skimp. i live a very stressful life filled with no excess or no real luxuries. i have a laptop and a cell phone and thats it besides my car and the clothes i have. i don't have internet at home or cable tv. hell i don't even have a tv. everything i do is with my phone and laptop. its the only joy i have left.because of all of this i've shut myself out from friends and family and am dealing with serious depression. a huge part of my problem is that i don't know what i want to do with the rest of my life. its like i have no drive or ambition. i try to start things and run into one snag or another and i just end up giving up because i just couldn't find the fight i needed to succeed. seeing as how i can't figure out what i should be doing, i have literally no ambition. I'm pretty sure this is why my gf left and moved back home. i was moving in slow motion and not really going anywhere. no woman wants that. it was a real wake up call for me but I'm so unemotional towards everything i do and everything i try that i can't seem to find a passion that i used to have at one time.i've thought about moving away to another province and trying to start fresh from scratch but i have to wait for my house to sell and I'm stuck in a bad car loan so it's not that easy. another part of me wants to travel the world but you can't travel without the excess funds and i just don't have it.the only thing I'm 100% sure of is that i hate my current status. my job, my car, where i live, the people I'm around. i hate all of it. i don't even know what i enjoy anymore because of the depression and my hatred for my surroundings. i know the first step to success is just that, taking that first step. but i just don't know the direction and where i should go.the only things i even get any enjoyment out of anymore is listening to music and walking/hiking. hell i have to do it alone all the time because i don't have any friends anymore.my family just says "do what makes you happy" but i don't even know what that is anymore.so reddit, what should i do? I'm so lost and confused.**TL:DR  I'm feeling pretty lost with my life and don't know how to move ahead.**

I've spent the last few years with, what i would call "man tits"I've focused a lot on chest related exercises and weights recently (including pushups, seated chest press machine and bench press) but have noticed that in my chest/peck area, my right side is much more toned and has much less fat now than the right side. I'm guessing it's because im right handed and my left hand/arm is much weaker than my right. I find it very off-putting. bi/tri/shoulders/lats/traps all seem to be pretty symmetrical. Is there a correct way to fix this so that my body is relatively even and more symmetrical from my left to right side, and i can continue on with a more symmetrical form?  Should i do free weights with slightly more weight on the left side? Focus on just the left side for a while? Is it simply bad form?

It's an older Samsung 50" 720p plasma that I got from my brother as a loaner while I don't have a tv. (it's a HPT5054X/XAC ver.BK02) I've always had LCD's and older CRT based RPTV's so maybe I'm just not used to it? I have a Panasonic DMP-BD75 blu-ray player hooked up via hdmi and have it set to auto which is sending out a 1080i signal and the tv (im assuming) is downresing it to whatever resolution it can display (presumably 1280x720) I have the tv set to "just scan" mode and have tried all forms of calibration from simple basic adjustments like colour, brightness and contrast.. to using the built in "movie" "vivid" modes as well as all kinds of various tweaks for colour temp and sharpness. Even when i tell the panny to output 720p the image is a tad softer but no real difference.It seems like black levels are either crushed out to the point where things are finally black and contrast is good, but detail is gone and whites are blown out OR everything seems washed out and colour saturation is bad. I'm not new to calibrating but 'm also not up on it since i haven't had to do this much since owning my last tv.it seems like nothing is ever actually black.. almost like the rgb pixels are always firing at all times and trying to create gray. if theres no signal or what i assume is a signal for a blank screen, it goes perfectly black (also when theres nothing playing and the pop-up showing "no signal" is up, its also deep rich black)I'm including a shot of the pixels and of the overall image (overall image is very watchable)can anyone offer tips or insight? http://imgur.com/a/ELA54
1twsr8	-54427	1388278074	explainlikeimfive	Why do regular standard def dvds still get produced?	If all of th major CEs no longer make 4:3 tv's, tvs without hdcp (or tvs that can't display at least 720p hd content) as well as the "analogue sunset" happening,and those companies focusing on hd/blu-ray content, why do they bother wasting money producing standard def 480i dvds? Blu ray has been out for about 7 years now and players are less then $50 for a basic player. Also, you can buy an hd capable tv for $150.. what's the point? Obviously they want to cater to those who haven't upgraded, but why bother? Especially when comparing modern new release DVD to blu, the blu always looks better. Its similar in my opinion to when DVD was out for a pile of years and yet they still put out vhs tapes. Aren't CEs like Sony, Panasonic and Samsung always trying to push new models and tech to the masses virtually every year? Wouldn't it make more sense to phase out the older stuff entirely and potentially focus on growing out the current gen before introducing stuff like 4K to the masses??

I've even tried this while pressing option during boot and attempting to do it from that menu but the same thing happens. Is there a way (maybe some other software i can download) that will allow me to resize the partition back to 250gb without formatting and wiping out my install?

1x1twu	-54427	1391571956	Pets	Cats behaviour is horrible. Getting worse every day. Help!	The cat is about a year old and is an indoor cat.  Within the last month or so it's taken a liking to randomly attacking and/or biting my hands/arms and feet/ankles. I have no idea why and it's 100% unprovoked.  The problem first is that he's even doing this,  but even bigger is that it seems that every time he does it and gets any form or reaction,  he does it a second time only much harder (to the point of actually attacking and not just playing)  he does it randomly so I never know when it's coming.  He has managed to make a pretty good gash in my arm that needed a stitch. In fact,  my arms and legs are covered in scars and scratches from the last month.  just tonight he did it while I was laying in bed reading and it startled me and caused so much pain (biting the forearm)  that my only reaction to stopping him and unclamping him from my arm was a swat on the snout.  I know this is unacceptable from me, but was simply a poor reaction on my part.  I feel like I just ruined any chance of changing the biting behaviour.  Help!  I'm not sure what to do.

1yxq3i	-54427	1393370174	explainlikeimfive	ELI5:Why do banks set very high interest if you have bad credit?	Is it all about punishing the people who have made poor financial decisions?  Rewarding the people who have made good decisions? Greed?  For example: what justification does a bank or lender have to apply a 10-15+% rate on say, a car loan? If a person has bad credit, wouldn't it be more beneficial to have that person actually be able to afford the transportation they need? or is it all about that person being more risky due to past payment mistakes?How do they expect people that may have just made mistakes that want to correct their flawed credit, but cant because the rates are so high it's not worth it?It seems flawed to me.

(Hopefully lifting her spirits)  It seems that the only way to do so is through a publisher and it may not give me enough time (Im in canada, so also a drawback). Is there a good method for this (or any author?)Sorry if I'm breaking the rules with this post. **Edit: I'm surprised by all the down votes. Thanks to some advice, I've been pointed to his email address and have sent him an email. Hopefully he will respond to me.

I'm looking to replace my aging Panasonic DMP-BD75 Blu-ray player in the coming months. Im mainly interested in something with wireless connectivity and ability to play more media from both usb and netflix.I'm having a hard time deciding if I should splurge and spend the $500 on the OPPO BDP-103, giving me all the features I could ever need (including some I just don't want or need)  and keeping it as a long term item, or going with a much less costly, similarly featured/lower quality (as in- NOT OPPO build quality) unit from Sony (BDPS6200) or Panasonic (DMP-BDT230).  Am i better off making a bigger investment and keeping it long term (the oppo) or making a much less substantial purchase with one of the other units and potentially just replacing sooner/more often?I should point out - my current setup isn't that great but in the future I plan to have a full media room again.

I've had a CIBC account before and I found the service at the branches to be a bit less than desirable, so I currently have a BMO account that I use for personal lending (I find the tellers to be way too invasive of my banking habits and personal info to use everyday) and PC Financial Account for my every day banking, which is pretty much entirely virtual. (the kiosks inside loblaws stores is pretty lacking)The only reason I keep the PC account is because virtually everything is free through them. I keep leaning towards TD for a new primary account to use since they have "visa debit" functions and the newer "tap to pay" functions for debit. The only drawback is that I have heard they aren't that great in terms of customer satisfaction and they can sometimes be hard to deal with. I would love to have someone enlighten me on the subject.

I'm doing this in the driveway and rapidly maxing out my budget for this repair. I'm at the point of needing to remove the crankshaft pulley/harmonic balancer HOWEVER the standard (albeit specialty) pullers used for this removal don't apply to the design of my particular model of car. It lacks the threaded holes necessary to screw in the removal tool bolts. I'm not sure if GM has a tool specific to this car, but I'm trying to get it off in a hurry as i only have the air tools until Monday morning . A brand new heavy-duty 3 arm puller is $75 (which I cannot justify paying for 10 minutes of usage) and the $19 specialty kit doesn't work on my model of car. I'm not able to get to princess auto or the larger Canadian tires as they are just too far on foot. **the TL,DR of this**, is that I'm wondering if any Kingston area redditors have maybe a heavy duty 3-arm puller with a good sized/flared tip on it or some other way of removing this pulley without any damage? Specifically, someone who might be willing to stop by my house with it for 15-20 mins so I can pull it off?

2tg5gm	-54429	1422049548	subaru	Coilover questions	So I recently bought a 2005 wrx. It came with coilovers. I noticed right away that it pulled to the left so I knew something was up. While inspecting them I noticed that the driver side was a lot lower then the passenger. So I removed the front tires and measured and the driver side was way lower. So I spend 20 minutes raising the coilovers (they're height adjustable). I got them to be the same height. It doesn't pull as much when you're driving on a flat road. But it still does. And when you make a left turn the wheel likes to stay left unless you go through the effort of putting the wheel strait again. It doesn't do this when you turn right. Any ideas?

I have also had a lot of tuning shops and other people just amsoil 5w-30. Right now I'm loosing a quart of oil every 1000 miles but only if I'm getting on boost a lot and really beating on it. I'm wondering what is better. Should I switch to amsoil or is rotella t6 really the best?

But I did some research and found out it could be a few things. So here's some background. It's an 05 wrx that is stage 2. So I monitored boost and I was only at 11psi peak. Now when I get on it sometimes it will rev up rpms but speed will stay the same. It started backfiring more. It just has been acting super weird. I know the tune is done open source. That's how I bought the car. It has 141k on it. Is it possible that maybe when I had my battery unplugged for a short period of time that it could reset the tune? I don't know much about tuning and hardly know much about cars. So I am hoping someone can help me out

3dnkqm	-54429	1437159196	subaru	ac questions	I have an 05 wrx. I have no ac and im trying to figure out if it is a leak. or if the system needs to be recharged so I have a few questions. Does every system eventually need to be recharged even if there is no leak? What is the best way to spot a leak. I have this weird thing that happened. This happened once. on a very hot day I was sitting on the side of the road in my car. it started overheating so i shut it off. when i turned the car back on after a little while and checking my coolant etc. it was running fine and was no longer over heating but my ac worked all the way to my destination. The car never overheated again but the ac hasnt been working still. it worked that one time though. Idk if that helps with figuring out the issue but i thought it was strange.

3fpf51	-54429	1438659680	subaru	Trans question	So I recently did a clutch on my car. Before I did my clutch my car would sometimes grind for a split second before 4th but only if I was ripping on it. I replaced the clutch and flywheel and all other related components. Including new gear oil. I just grabbed the valvoline oil as I didn't think it should matter brand. I used the valvoline in my previous car and it was fine. Anyways. Now it grinds into 4th every time. Not bad. Just quick and quiet. Sometimes it's even just sorta hard to get into gear but doesn't grind. I also have kartboy shifting bushings. Could my bushings be too tightened after re installing my trans. Is it something to do with my gear oil? Or is it possible it will go away after I break in the clutch and after the gear oil has been run through a few times? Just looking for some advise and feedback. Thanks 
3fu7ra	-54429	1438750040	subaru	Clutch pedal adjustment	Anyone know the stock location of the clutch pedal is suppose to be. I replaced my clutch recently and tried adjusting my pedal as it was recommended. I marked it with a sharpie but apparently not good enough as I could no longer see the mark. I don't know where it was suppose to be originally but it feels like I push down a little bit before it starts actually engaging. But I adjusted it so that it was just stop on the little stopper that keeps it from coming too far forward if that makes sense. I was just wondering I guess if anyone knows where it's suppose to be positioned from the factory

I'm going to PAX Aus tomorrow (Sunday) with my cousin, and he wants to get there at 10, which means leaving home at 9:15. Now that's a bit early for me so I was just wondering if people knew how long we're likely to wait in line if we get there at 10, 11 or 12?    Also, he said that it will close early on Sunday (which I don't think it will) but will they start to pack up booths and such early on Sunday, or will we be able to get the full PAX experience until 6:00 PM Sunday?Edit: He's under 15 and I'm over 18 so he needs me to be there for him to get in, so going at different times is not an option

I've recently gotten into the trading/investing game and so far I've gotten 17 keys but now I'm not sure what to invest in.   I've been investing in skins that I can flip for an extra key in a few weeks, so I'm here to ask if anyone has some good ideas of what I can invest in next.  I'm looking for items (skins, cases, stickers) worth $5-$15 USD that I can flip for an extra key after a few weeks  If there are skins that are worth more keys (13-17) that looks like they might rise I'd be interested to hear about those too, but I'd rather not put all my eggs in 1 basket.

2qi3b3	-54434	1419651649	woodworking	Do you think someone with little woodworking experience and basic tools could build a desk?	This post is just going to be a bunch of questions along the lines of "Should/Could I build a desk", **TL;DR at bottom**  A little bit of background on me, I'm 19, living with my parents, My Dad has offered to help, and I'm sure my uncles (who have a bit more woodworking experience) will as well, I took woodworking class's at school in years 9 and 10 (age's 14 and 15) so I know the basics of woodworking.First off, I'm not sure whether I should build or buy, Which brings up my first question:  * **1. Is it generally cheaper to build or buy a desk?**  Secondly, as I said, I'm 19 years old, living with my parents, so:  * **2. Will I be able to build a basic desk with the basic tools my dad has, such as hammers, saws (some electric, some not), drills, etc?**  Now I was thinking of a pretty basic design, just a rectangle top, a leg in each corner, a few drawers which brings me to my third question:  * **3. Is that the best design for a desk? I assume it's the easiest, but is there a better, sturdier design that's still somewhat easy to build?**  And also:  * **4. What would be the best type of wood to build from (that is available at a local hardware store, I'm Australian so the local hardware store's are [Bunnings](http://www.bunnings.com.au/), [Masters](https://www.masters.com.au) and [Mitre 10](http://www.mitre10.com.au/))**  I could get my Dad on board for the project pretty easily, but my Mum needs a bit more convincing, such as seeing some plans, so:* **5. What is the best way to draw up plans? I saw sketchup in the FAQ, is that the best option, or is hand drawn the way to go?**  The last thing, which is not super important, is that I would like this desk to be ready in time for University, which starts mid Feb, but I'm going away until mid Jan (during which time I can hopefully get the designs done), so the last question is:  * **6. Could I build a desk in 3 to 4 weeks?**    **TL;DR**  * **1. Is it generally cheaper to build or buy a desk?**  * **2. Will I be able to build a basic desk with the basic tools my dad has, such as hammers, saws (some electric, some not), drills, etc?**  * **3. Is the rectangle top, 4 legs the best design for a desk? I assume it's the easiest, but is there a better, sturdier design that's still somewhat easy to build?**  * **4. What would be the best type of wood to build from (that is available at a local hardware store, I'm Australian so the local hardware store's are [Bunnings](http://www.bunnings.com.au/), [Masters](https://www.masters.com.au) and [Mitre 10](http://www.mitre10.com.au/))**  * **5.

Could I build a desk in 3 to 4 weeks?**    I'm note sure if this is the right sub for this, but I'm pretty sure it is, if it's not please let me know and I'll post it else where, and thank you in advance for responses, if there are any.  And I'm sorry if there's stuff in here that is answered in the FAQ, I was in a bit of a rush posting this, haven't had time to read it all.    ***edit***  I'm sorry for taking so long to reply to all the comments, For some reason I never reply when I see a comment,.  Anyway, I've decided that I won't be building a desk for now. I'm going to start with some smaller stuff and leave the desk for a bit.  I think I'll build it during uni holidays, since I'm doing an Electronic Engineering course, so I know exactly what features I'll need and hopefully by then I'll be able to add some cool electronic stuff.  And I went into uni for an information session recently and saw what looked like a wood shop near my building, so there's a good chance I can make some friends their and get some help and advice from them.  But thanks for all the replies, I will be taking everything you guys said into consideration.

2keg8f	-54450	1414357260	spacex	Using fixed landing platforms in the ocean for returning stages	Why won't SpaceX build platforms in the ocean (at the size of oil rigs) for their returning stages? I imagine that not having to boost back to their launch site, but being able to mostly just continue on their trajectory would save a ton of Delta-V and therefore increase the payload mass of the F9 (Does anyone have a rough estimate on how much?). Also, if something went wrong, they could simply abort the stage into the ocean, because nobody would care.Drawbacks would of course be the expensive platform itself, but since it is a one-time investment (with some running costs, obviously), I don't see it as much of a hinderance. Landed stages would need to be returned to dry land, but I believe this won't cost much either.Does anybody else know any major reasons of why this probably is a bad idea? Thanks!

It seems to me as if the IL-10 (1946) is extremely prone to loosing its wings, while the 23mm Cannons with an ~8kg burst mass don't deal much damage at all. After playing 6 matches with it in Arcarde, I got only 1 (!) kill on an enemy plane, but I was shot down once by AAA and once by a landing craft (which usually never happens).

Several I could think of are:* Thickening the walls of the transfer vehicle (which would massively increase launch costs) or at least creating some kind of "storm shelter" to be used when radiation levels are especially high.* building  underground bases on Mars since there is no magnetic field and the thin Martian atmosphere doesn't protect very well either* Artificially creating a magnetic field around the spacecraft (I imagine that this would probably cost a lot of power and would be prone to failure)* Reducing the travel time as much as possible through advanced propulsion techniques (like ion propulsion)* Choosing relatively old astronauts as their bodies can handle more radiation than younger peopleEdit: Thanks for all your replies!

Which line do you prefer?* Are the B17s and the B24 capable bombers? Is it worth completing the gunner rank for, say, the B17g so that they operate at their maximum efficiency?* Are there any specific premium planes that you would recommend?Thanks for your help!
2qq27s	-54450	1419872410	Warthunder	Lead indicators for gunner's view? (AB)	Seeing that gunners are relatively underpowered anyways, it bothers me to see that the lead indicators that are shown whilst using the gunner's view to defend your plane are completely useless. Am I doing something wrong or are the lead indicators for gunners indeed utterly useless? Does Gaijin have plans to fix this issue?Being an avid Yer-2 ACh-30B Early bomber pilot, I am quite frustrated that for the one time my gunners actually manage to shoot an attacking plane down, I die myself 20 other times. I realise that gunners aren't supposed to be some magical protection against enemies, but the least Gaijin could do is fix this issue.

31r43s	-54450	1428418015	spacex	Discussion: Why should we go to Mars?	I know this has been answered in the FAQ, but I feel like calling the exploration of Mars "a step in the evolution of life" and that "exploration is really what separates humans from other living species" is not good enough. These are the usual, idealistic justifications and they seem to be spoken from an ivory tower, detached from the harsh realities of life. I will present some common arguments against going to Mars. The above answers feel unsatisfying, maybe someone can give me a good answer.We don't need Mars as a safe haven. The chance of an asteroid destroying all of humanity in the next couple of centuries is ridiculously low (which is a common argument for the colonization of Mars), it is much more likely that we humans will kill ourselves (Climate Change, Overpopulation, Resource Depletion, rogue AI, etc.).There are millions of people on our planet who don't have access to even the most basic resources, such as (clean) water, food and medical care. Many countries lack real, democratic governments, in which the people's freedom (say, freedom of speech) is ensured. Whole continents are crippled because of those issues, their inhabitants often have a standard of living which a western person would often deem beneath human dignity. And yet, we send all kinds of expensive machinery in space. Colorful pictures of Mars are neat, but how is that going to help a starving child living in a country which cannot care for its own people? Instead of tackling real, imminent problems, we do what we find fun: Spend billions of dollars on huge rockets and fancy space probes.Don't get me wrong, I love space exploration, and in particular what SpaceX is doing. Still, I can't help but get the occasional feeling that we should focus our efforts on something more important. Sure, a colony on Mars sound cool, but it would mostly be a sanctuary for the rich, while for the poor and underprivileged on Earth nothing will have changed. Why go to Mars? It's a waste of money and time, and our efforts should be spent somewhere where they are really needed.

Over the past few weeks I have lost any desire to play LHL, as it just isn't fun for me. When I was first drafted, and I saw all the talent above me, I figured I would be a bench-warmer like last year. I ended up getting playing time in preseason games, which I thought was my only time that I would consistently get. My fate changed when other teammates didn't show up, which allowed me to start every LHL game I had shown up for. I thought that getting playing time would be one of the best moments that I've ever had in this game. That ended up not being the case, though. I enjoy playing HQML or in Pubs, but something about playing LHL makes it not enjoyable for me to play. Whatever it is, it is not the competitive nature of the LHL. I'm a competitive individual, and that's one of the reasons I've always wanted to play in the LHL. Thank you to all the GM's who were willing to give me a chance to play. I am sorry to all my teammates on Atlanta if this puts you in a rough spot at all.I’m formally announcing my retirement from the Legends Hockey League.

1owsuw	-54472	1382373475	leagueoflegends	A new proposal for Lyte's group on player behavior and community health.	There was a presentation done by Lyte's group a while back with regard to priming effects on in-game behavior through use of tooltips. During this presentation, the group also discussed Tribunal ban behavior and how certain words had particularly strong correlations with bans (foregoing the use of those words here, but they're typically related to hate speech). I would like to see a study related to the use of non-hate speech vocabulary and correlations with tribunal evaluation. For example, words like 'trash', 'kid', and 'noob' probably have very high relationships with reports and bans. This research could then be applied in game, with a chat monitoring system, that weights reports more heavily when the chat log includes that type of language, effectively sending toxic players to the tribunal with a higher degree of accuracy and after a smaller number of toxic games. I am sure there are also other language elements that aren't as obvious that would relate to community filtration and reform. Please let me know what you think, and obviously red posters are more than welcome to weigh in!EDIT: I would also appreciate it if someone could attach the link to the priming presentation here... I seem to have lost it.

You and your duo partner are in the brush bot lane, and their support/ADC combo is face-checking your brush (for those of you who want to get technical, champs and defensive stats are, say, Sona with Armor Quints and Yellows and MR Blues, and Ashe with Doran's Blade).

I have a 95.4% accuracy with my votes, and, with few exceptions, read the full chat log of each game before I make a decision.That said, on an average day, I will pardon 0 summoners who come through the Tribunal, and when I do parson someone, I typically am in the minority for that case.This makes me wonder a couple of things. Would Tribunal members who notice this punish everyone to maintain an accuracy of 95%+? Does this indicate that the system that kicks summoners to Tribunal is remarkably accurate, or does it indicate that, isolated from context, we would all be punished? Does the Tribunal system isolate toxic summoners, or just toxic games?Before responding, please read a brief overview of the Tribunal system here: http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=35694081#35694081I intend to do a couple of research projects on the Tribunal in the near future, once I've built my case history to a total of about 1000 cases, but in the mean time I am interested in your insights. Is the Tribunal an effective system? Are summoners innocent until proven guilty? Please don't flame the system just because you've been banned, I am looking for constructive content only.

1pex5p	-54472	1382994088	leagueoflegends	Smurfing: An Overview and Potential Solution	We've all been there. For me, it was my first game. 5 Level 1 Summoners, 2 of them shouting at the others."Ashe doesn't go top, wtf nub""why you feed""dude dont push youl get ganked"This is the harsh introduction most people get to the League of Legends community. Vocabulary aside, the very nature of our community is somewhat trial-by-fire. And this is largely because, even at level 1, a fair percentage of all players are smurfs.There are reasons why we smurf. I, myself, in spite of that first experience, have several smurfs who I have leveled through the years. We do it for a number of reasons... whether we want to learn a new champion in a (relatively) safe environment, or want to change our summoner name without paying for it, or whether we want to have some fun and be allowed to take the game a little less seriously, or whether we want to check out if that troll build we've heard so much about really works. Maybe you've just gotten back from a year long hiatus, and want to relearn everything from the ground up, since you've never even heard of a "Runic Bulwark". (I understand that many matchmaking elements have been introduced to address these issues, and that the new queuing system Lyte's team is working on will also take care of some of these concerns)Valid reasons aside though, there's no denying that smurfing, at least for some portions of the learning experience, serves as an active detriment to the community. It also moves toxic players who have been banned or have had their accounts suspended back to level 1, where they represent our community to anyone curious about the game. (I understand and respect that the Tribunal and other systems works to weed out, reform, and prevent cases like this, but it definitely still happens.)Maybe its time we looked for a solution to smurfing. A way to provide players with what they seek (a clean slate, under a new alias, in a safe environment), that doesn't create other issues within the community.It sounds counterintuitive, but my suggestion is that Riot actively accept the Smurfing portion of the LoL experience. In implementation, they would make it so that the same login could be associated with multiple summoners, who have access to the same champions and runes, even if they don't yet have the levels to use a full rune page. This would allow Riot to track smurfs in the tribunal, acquire more accurate statistics on smurfing and its impact on gameplay, and it would allow us (the community) to continue smurfing as need be. The only change would be that it would occur in a more friendly (and monitorable) environment for everyone (perhaps keeping the Smurf queue independent of the New Player queue until level 15 or so). I am operating under the assumption that, given the option, players would choose to smurf with the same account credentials, which I think is reasonable, but feel free to let me know what you think.TL;DR: Smurfing is negative for the community, but is obviously a large part of the LoL experience. Allow multiple summoners to be associated with one set of login credentials.

It might be that Taric, Thresh, and Leona are such massive powerhouses that they are outshining other champs, but it really seems to me as though the defense tree is the strongest option for supports at present.I would like to know your thoughts on the current season, builds for various supports, and how you view the bot-lane as it stands. Other fodder for discussion might include match-ups, lane synergy, or any other points of supporting you've taken some time to reflect on.**TL;DR:** We're in a new season and I haven't seen a fruitful discussion about support masteries yet. Please discuss.
1uqrwl	-54472	1389217607	leagueoflegends	Strategic Advice on a Situation I Don't Know How to Handle	On the current patch, especially with the prevalence of tanky top laners in recent history, I've had trouble handling split push scenarios. When the enemy top laner gets ahead in the early game, their lane presence seems to dictate the pace of the game mid-late more than any other factor in the game. This has gotten so bad that I've started banning Shyvana, Nasus, and Dr. Mundo just to try and avoid this situation altogether. But I am wondering if there is some option I am missing.Imagine that you are 15 minutes into the game, and your top lane Renekton is 0/2/0 against his lane opponent Jax (lets skip the "why would Renekton lose his lane" part of this thread). You are bot lane with your duo partner (you are Leona and your partner is Jinx), having beaten the opposing Caitlyn and Taric pretty handily, and are now 2 kills and 20 CS up on the opposition. Both mid lane turrets and the opponent's bot lane turret are now gone, and dragon is down for another 4 minutes. Mid lane has ended roughly evenly, and their Gragas has the wave clear to prevent a seige.What do you do in this situation? Do you rotate top, sending your behind-Renekton into a 2v1 bot? Do you hard push mid, trying to seige an opposing Gragas? Do you remain bot, and try to push through for an additional turret? EDIT: Imagine that you have the ability to control where everyone on the team groups, rotates, and contests.**TL;DR: I don't know how, as a bot laner, to handle a situation in which top lane has lost, regardless of how well I am doing in lane, and would like to start a discussion on counter-split push strats.**

1v61m6	-54472	1389673915	leagueoflegends	[Riot Please] Weighted LP!	Its no secret: Supports cannot carry as hard as mid laners. We also can't carry as hard as top laners, ADCs, or junglers for that matter! This leaves us support specialists in an interesting connundrum. Do we continue to dedicate ourselves to the role we love, and continue to lose games periodically due to elements beyond our control? Or do we switch roles, and go 10/1/5 as Zyra in mid lane instead?Its an interesting concept, and one that Riot *IS* attempting to address. For example, the new queue where folks are able to assign a specific meta to a game, and select their own team is currently on PBE. However, the several months or more that this feature may take to develop simply isn't ignorable in the interim. I have another suggestion. Riot, I would request that you develop a system of identifying the lane that a given player has queued for in ranked 5v5 solo queue. I believe that 99% of ranked solo queue games follow standard meta (Top, Mid, Bot Support, Bot ADC, Jungler), and would be willing to research stats to support this statement if enough interest arises from this post. From there, I would ask that we determine the average number of games that it takes a specialist in a given role to identify their ELO (MMR, league, division, LP, rank, whatever we want to call it) in the current system. I would then ask that you weight wins and losses within that role accordingly.This is an interesting ask, particularly given that you are currently developing tools to deal with this in an alternative fashion. But I do know that, when I am paired with an ADC who can't last hit, as a platinum support, its a particularly frustrating experience.You've made considerable measures to ensure that league is a positive experience for EVERY role, and this is something that I feel is relatively small, that might further boost the experience of league players everywhere. Again, a disclaimer, I don't pretend to understand your database, client, or what the system is currently capable of handling. But I do believe that a weighted LP system would be more effective and would improve the ranked experience of the majority of players, with relatively few man-hours of commitment.TL;DR: Certain roles impact the overall win-loss ratio of a team less than others. By building a system that detects role within the current meta, Riot could isolate a players Rank, MMR, LP, Division, and Tier more easily, and improve gameplay for the majority of players, with relatively few manhours invested. Riot could even work with 3rd party vendors of information such as lolking.net to isolate this information.

Brute force strategies are unfun and uninteresting, and take a lot of the intricacy out of the game. It should also be noted that brute forcing these locks is incredibly expensive and can only be done by top-tier players, because they often require ladders, which are insanely expensive.What if, instead, there were an item that could generate power into a system? It could be used on wires, grates, or wired walls - any tile that can conduct electricity. I believe this would allow the game to go back to its 8-item limit set-up, which felt a lot more balanced outside of a few cases of abuse.**TL;DR:** Add an item that produces electricity and can power conductive tiles.**EDIT** I mean for this to be a thief tool.

Given the amount that legendary and epic cards dictate high-level play and the majority of the current meta at the higher levels on the ranked ladder (kicking in around level 15+), it would be nice to have an option to play without these cards.This wouldn't have to be a ranked queue, just a normals queue with card restrictions. No legendaries, no epics, otherwise the same rules as constructed. I recognize that this might stymie some cash influx for Blizzard (given a potential reduction in pack purchases to gather epic and legendary cards), but I think the improved environment for players with incomplete collection would ultimately self-correct that market imbalance (by creating more long-term players).

I'd always been told to sleep well and have sweet dreams, but all that was ever waiting for me when I nodded off was an endless reel of nightmares.Nothing particularly unusual of course. I've fallen for eternity, lost all of my teeth, spent a night running from some unnamed beast, and lost everyone I've ever loved. You know, the usual stuff.They don't *mean* anything of course. At least... they never have before.'Sweet dreams', you said. And I had them. For the first time in my life, I had them.But you weren't there. And that was what made them sweet.Once I woke up, I laid there for a while. And I could hear your breathing. A soft and simple thing, like a spring breeze. But I hadn't heard it all night.I laid there for a while. And I could feel your arm under my pillow. That arm which I'd held so close for those past few years. That arm which had held me on countless nights, as I gasped ragged breaths of air, shocked awake from some new demon tormenting my sleep. But I hadn't felt it all night.I laid there for a while. And I smelled the scent of your hair. That lingering reminder of who and what *you* mean to me, mixed with the shampoo I'd told you I loved. But I hadn't smelled it all night.I laid there for a while. And I could see the first rays of dawn radiating through the diamond on your hand. The diamond I'd put there.I've never slept so well. Not in all of my years. And I've never felt the weight of the world lifted from my shoulders like that."So what now...?" I whispered to no one in particular, my lips buried in your beautiful mane of sun-kissed hair. A mistake. My time alone is gone.You awaken, softly and gently. You yawn quietly. And blink the sleep from your eyes. And you ask me, "how did you sleep?""Well. Really, really well."And now I have to tell you what that dream meant to me.
333s6i	-54472	1429424573	shortstories	[RF] Good Morning	&gt; ***Any feedback is greatly appreciated.***Groggy thoughts. Bleary eyes. A faint echo of last night's dreams of suicide. My phone reads '8:27 AM'. Three minutes left to be heading outside. I've hit 'snooze' too many times again.I sit up begrudgingly, wanting nothing more than to crawl back under the covers once more. The sheets are still warm and inviting, and I've been pulled back by that siren song three times so far this month alone.But I guess I'm doing a little better today, because I finally manage to lift my clunky frame from the edge of the bed on which I'd been sitting, adjusting to the light filtering through the closed blinds. As I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror I stomach a wave of self-loathing and revulsion that seems all too familiar.The eyes that stare back at me have aged 10 years in a fifth of that time. The unkempt goatee I used to so carefully groom stretches down my neck, a shoddy replacement for a jaw-line. My hair is a mess of knots and cowlicks--it hasn't been cut in months. My pudgy exterior and stretch marks meet my gaze, and I try to ignore the hatred of my own form welling up inside of me.Stepping on creaking floorboards and joints, I make my way to the bathroom. A minute or so later and I've finished some half-assed attempt to pull myself together. The whiskers, toothpaste, residual hair-gel and soap suds left sitting in the sink are a testament to that.Then I find myself pulling on some formless and baggy clothes, stuffing my keys, wallet, and phone into my pockets, and heading outside to jump in my aging car.I've skipped breakfast again, but the cans of soda and bags of candy lying in my desk will sate my growing hunger once I've made my way to work. And when those fail, a colossal plate of some greasy salt-laden takeout will hold me over until I make my way back to the place I call home.As these thoughts flick through my mind, a genuine smile flashes across my face. I do love the easy life.

I don't know how to play a measure where the right thumb plays a flat. How should my hand be positioned to play something like this: E-flat + C, G, A, G, A, E-flat + CSo far I've either had to cock my wrist to the side or have had to move my fingers very far forward on the keys. Is there a better solution? Thanks!

On a snowy winter day in college I was walking along academic row and saw an (incredibly cute) girl sliding around on a patch of ice and laughing. She saw me looking, came over, and struck up a conversation. I was so caught off-guard that I completely missed the opportunity to exchange numbers.

But when her parents introduced themselves to me, I missed the opportunity to establish what I was supposed to call them.From that point forward, I never knew whether to use Mr./Mrs. [Last Name], or refer to them by their first names. So instead... I just... didn't. For a year and a half I avoided using their names even once.

3esxfg	-54472	1438023064	PointlessStories	I've become something of an accidental mute.	Lately I've been working on things that I actually care about. But as it turns out, most of those things are solitary. I spend a fair bit of time each day working out, or playing piano, or reading. And almost none actually talking to people (verbally, I mean--I'll still IM with people or answer e-mails or whathaveyou).Which would be more or less moot if I actually talked at my job, but I work mostly with statistics and large data sets. 99% of my work day is spent with headphones on.I realized about an hour ago that I haven't said a word to anyone today. And that that's kind of normal for me now. It's nice, in a way.
3ewn1l	-54472	1438096218	PointlessStories	I take a notepad and pen to the bathroom.	Any time I think I'm going to be in the bathroom for more than a minute or two, I take a notepad and pen with me. And do nothing with them.I got into the habit about half a year ago, when I would use the time to write. Writing helped me to sort out various upheavals and life-events and so on, and I think it helped me avoid a lot of really silly decisions in the long term. But now that my life has more or less settled back to its normal routine, I don't have anything to write about. So the notepad sits on the floor of the stall, unused, and I'm pretty sure anyone who sees it thinks I'm pretty weird.

You look back at the paused t.v and see the evil creature getting closer to the hero. You know the t.v is paused and you just replaced the batteries on the remote but the picture hasn't stopped. Suddenly you realize that this horrid thing is no longer looking at the hero but at you. It seems to be getting closer. Suddenly it's beastly claws wrap around the edge of the t.v, it's legs steps out and suddenly you realize it wasn't the remote that was broken.

Hey guys, Here are my current specs: AMD FX-8120 @ 4.2GHz Gigabyte GA-990FXA-UD3 mobo Gigabyte Nvidia Geforce GTX 660ti Corsair CX750 PSU Corsair vengeance 8GB (4x2) Corsair H60 liquid cooling for CPU Zalman z9 plus Mid tower My plan is to upgrade to the 8350 and perhaps get another 660ti in SLI but i want to know a few things before I put a hole in my wallet: 1. Is it worth going from 8120 to the 8350? Will the improvement justify spending $200? 2. Will my PSU be enough to run the 8350 (likely to be overclocked) with 660ti SLI? 3. Will a 660ti be bottlenecked by the 8350 in terms of gaming? 4. Is the H60 a good enough cooler to overclock the 8350? Thanks!

2is3yp	-54498	1412878771	SuggestALaptop	Macbook Air vs. Surface Pro 3	My white macbook finally died on me and I need a new laptop. I do not care about the OS as I have used both for many years. What I do care about is:1. Quality (how long it will last)I've always loved how the metal macbooks always felt so new. My mom's macbook air is 2 years old and my girlfriend's macbook pro is 4 years old and they both feel so new and solid. I feel like I could own a macbook air for many years without feeling like I need a new machine. As cool as the SP3 is, I'm worred that it will start to feel old really fast like many other tablets. But perhaps because it is a hybrid it will be different?2. Battery lifeI HATED having to sit near a power socket just to power my laptop for a few hours. I've heard good things about both machines but perhaps owner can give me their input on how battery life actually is.3. All-in-one-nessI was mostly intrigued by the SP3's pen. I usually take notes on paper; however, the tablet form of the SP3 can become very useful to the point where I might not have to bring notebooks any more. I would also like to have all my books/textbooks electronically and I know both are capable of that. I'd like to note that I have a Nexus 7 that I use to keep my textbooks in currently, but if there is no longer use for it then I may be able to sell it.So far I'm leaning towards the MBA because I feel that it will last the longest out of the two. Plus, the MBA is an ultrabook and not a tablet/laptop hybrid like that SP3 which to me feels a bit "gimmicky". I have a friend who sold his SP2 because he felt that he didn't have any use for it compared to his laptop.Please let me know what you think. Perhaps you can persuade me to pick the SP3 over the MBA.

2ki2uo	-54498	1414444324	SuggestALaptop	Cheap ultrabook or hybrid for school with good battery life. (600 CAD or less) (will consider second hand)	Something for writing papers, research, note taking, etc.. Was thinking about the surface pro 1 but the battery life is not that great..
2kn5d7	-54498	1414554193	Surface	SP1 still a good buy?	I've been looking for a cheap ultrabook or hybrid for school and media use, so my friend recommended that I get the Surface pro 1 now that they are quite cheap used. One downside for me is that the battery life is abysmal; however, there is the option of buying a power cover. Do you guys think that the first Gen surface is still a good buy today?

23i48u	-54522	1397990419	leagueoflegends	Things garena server doesn't have	First off I know that garena is garena and riot is riot and that riot can't really do anything about garena but hopefully if this post gets enough attention someone from riot/garena will notice it. For extra background info, I have been playing on the SEA server (sg/my) since 2012. Recently Garena has been doing quite alot of sales and has improved over the past years but quite alot of features are lacking.1. Team builder. While NA server and EU server have gotten it twice(IIRC), we on garena don't even have it. I have absolutely no idea why garena refuses to release teambuilder on its servers.2. Normal draft. While there had been a few threads on garena forum asking about it, the main consensus as to why it isnt implemented is that it will further divide the small player population, increasing the rank and normal queue time. While this may seem like a legit reason, league has grown alot since it was introduced in SEA. I'm sure that the player population has increased enough for normal draft to be implemented. 3. Lack of community interaction. If you check our garena forums, they are basically dead other than the help section which is filled with threads made by children asking for help (can tell by their standard of English). While I dont blame them for the not interacting on the forums due to the general maturity level of the people there, I havent seen a single one in my 2000+games played. If I was on NA servers, I'm pretty sure I would have met at least a couple of rioters.Also another problem thats not really caused by garena. No one, I mean literally no one plays dominion or TT on the server. The only time you get to play it is when you go into a custom game.TL:DR garena no teambuilder and normal draft. Garena also doesnt give a shit about it players.

How do i achieve it and how is the gold earned from that calculated?4. Is it normal that science and cultural victories take much longer than domination and diplomatic?5. Is venice effectively 1 city if there are no CS in the game and it does not capture any cities?6. In the late game is it always better to go for tenets in ideology than social policies?

I tend to play wide and normally have around 6-8 cities. However my cities are quite far apart(6-8 tiles away, resulting in the ai forward settling/sneaking in some cities which i have to clear(taking up my tiles) leading to a warmonger penalty affer i clear them, only for another ai to settle.2. I start in the classical era(i know i shouldnt but i prefer it that way) and often am lacking behind in military, causing the AI to dow me. I am however able to hold my own and take their cities after some time though. Is there something i should change in my build order?3. Im not sure if im having bad luck or cs are just so hard to find. The few games i played had me finding cs 100+turns into the game. Also cant help but notice somehow every cs is allied to ai somehow and its hard to wrestle back control in world congress if i dont have forbidden palace(i normally go piety as i almost always have a dominant religion). Is it suppozed to be like this?4. Gold generation. I always seem to be lacking in gold during the early game(classical-reseinance) only depending on tithe to keep me afloat. Trade routes just simply dont provide enough gold. Am i building too muxh buildings or units?Also I'm playing with the extended eras mod(marathon resarch cost,quick(?) Production cost) does that make it significantly harder for me? TIA for giving me advice!

346fu4	-54526	1430243803	legaladvice	Reopening an estate that has been closed for 7 years (Pennsylvania)	7 years ago my step mothers brother died, in his will he left his entire estate to her. She sold the house and retrieved the belongings one of which was a motorcycle. However in the process of moving the title was lost still in the deceased name. I am now 20 and my step mother has agreed to give me the bike sign it over to me. However without a title it is pretty difficult. To get a replacement title I was told  the the executor of the will will need to re-open the estate.(the executor is my step mom and it will cost $70.50) since 2008 she has had a devorice from her previous husband .When it comes to reopening the estate she has her concerns. Such as if the estate is reopened can anyone come after her for financial reimbursement. (Hospital bills, lawsuits, a lien , etc)? Will her ex husband have any claim? Can the estate be immediately closed after getting the short certificates for the bike title? Will reopening the estate cause her any financial or legal issues? I am a college student who was really looking forward to riding this summer and cannot afford to hire an attorney and is not looking to get into any financial or legal troubles.

(she also happens to be the executor of the will this man has been dead for close to 10 years she has also been in possession of bike for that long) however the title is lost. i had a police friend check the vin and its clean.the next step is id like to get the title in my name so i can register it or sell it. however to do so i was told that i would have to have executor of the will go reopen the estate(because all death certificates and short certificates are expired), have the title transferred to her and then transfer it to me. she doesn't want to do this because the county where the previous owner lived and the county where we live now are across the state.(6hours). i was also told i could try the court of common pleas. is that expensive(court costs, filing costs)? and would i have a persuasive case.(my reasoning would be that the owner is dead and the executor of the will gave/sold it to me) if so how long would i be waiting?i was also told to try filing for a duplicate title but i feel like that wouldn't work at all.also i don't know if this is any help but the executor and the informant on the will are different we were told the informant would have to sign the bike over but she lives in CO

3f0vdt	-54530	1438174955	architecture	TradArch listserv	http://www.tradarch.net/TradArch is an architectural listserv ostensibly dedicated to practitioners of traditional architecture. Don't take that verbatim though. I would say that more than half of the contributors might be loosely defined as Post Modernists.The key point is that there is a very high level of debate going on here (internally called the 'garden party') of top practitioners, principals of firms, leaders of movements. They are aware of reddit but condescend the dialogue as infantile, beneath them. They don't feel anything of intellectual merit happens here. While it is a younger crowd and sometimes true, I certainly don't agree that is always the case. I've found some very insightful commentary here.If you are prepared and actively seeking to espouse your views, have them challenged, refine your own philosophy within a sophisticated community this may be of interest to you.

The maker movement is totally cool. Architecture is all about making things after all.Its stuck in the mud though. Bogged down with theory and philosophy. Drowning in bureaucracy and codes, ever changing software and hardware. Specialised to death. Forget it if you want to design from ground up and see it to the finish. What young person in their right mind would get into 6 figures of debt to embrace that?I think there is hope though and I'll tell you why: craft beerWhen I was a kid there were 3 brewers in the US: Anheuser-Busch, Coors and Miller. If you wanted a dark beer they made it, a light beer they made it. The industry was wrapped up. They controlled the markets, the distribution and offered a price point that to this day can't be beat.They've lost their stranglehold on the market to local, traditional craft brewers who charge twice the price. Why? The establishment ain't cool. They're not makers, they're producers. They're in a word inauthentic. Are the contemporary traditional craft brewers pastiche, kitsch? I don't know, maybe they are. Who cares? I can meet them personally, hear their story and their beer kicks ass. Makers are cool.The future of architecture is local, traditional and design build. It will be about makers and it will be the coolest...

2zparf	-54552	1426861769	leagueoflegends	Why is there no loss prevention for afks and DCs?	After having just endured 2 games in a row with someone disconnected from the very beginning, I am unable to grasp why there can be no loss prevention for these types of scenarios. It happens regularly for a lot of people I would guess. To the best of my knowledge, other similar games have this with various measures implemented as to combat abuse; which I understand is the main reason for this not to be implemented.*  It could be someone never connecting to a game, which should be easily detectab*  if someone afks/disconnects before 2 minutes*  or first blood - something similar. The afk or disconnected player would get a penalty anyhow, so I can't see how it could be abused. If you didn't like your team, you could have dodged for free in champ select. As a game that want's to be taken seriously on a competetive level, this just feels so brutally out of order in a ranked environment that points still go when playing with an obvious disadvantage from the very beginning. I understand this might be a problem with duo queues, where one player can take the hit for his buddy, but let's face it. Every system can possibly be abused somehow, by someone. For all the good that would come of it, it has to outweigh what a small minority might do. Maybe disable it for duo queues even if it's a problem.I'd like to start a discussion on the topic - it's a missing feature that other games have.

zeilu	-54558	1346867145	trees	Joints are Awesome	I am usually the first person to suggest smoking a bong in my ent group, and I smoke pipes/bowls often when I am alone. But, nothing compares to smoking a nice joint.I find bongs to be the most efficient and flexible way of smoking. You get a lot of bang for your buck. When you can burn as much as you want, you get to dictate the speed of smoking and length of time. As opposed to joints where you have to out it and then it's a dirty hassle. Bong bowls can be quickly packed and you can be on your way out of the matrix within minutes.Pipes and bowls are similar to bongs except the rips aren't as hard. Yes, you can pull a while on it to get a large hit, resulting in the pain which you feel when you inhale a large amount of burnt plant matter and hot smoke without any kind of filtration. Pipes and bowls are good for chilling.Joints, however, are awesome. Despite the drawbacks of smelling badly if you out it, not being very efficient and... I couldn't really think of another downside. First of all, it is the best way to smoke socially. It is easy to pass, share and smoke from.Once you practice and do it enough it gets easy and quick to roll. In fact, rolling becomes a joy. I love rolling, and a lot of my friends do, too. We usually take turns and every round have an awesome j rolled. I never understood the posts about there not being anyone able to roll, but I digress.And the thing I like most about joints: it gets you really high. Most often it is not a large amount of weed. But it gets three to four people decently stoned, despite the losses that happen when nobody is smoking it.A little anecdote on strength of joints. For the past couple of weeks I have been waking and baking with a new wooden pipe I got myself. I've been getting very high. Lately, however, I've noticed that my highs last shorter and aren't as intense. I attributed it to increasing my tolerance and just smoked more. This morning I decided to roll a joint. It was a decent sized joint with OCB organic hemp papers. I smoked half of it two hours ago and I am high as fuck.* * *As I was writing this I thought that the intense high might be from a change of smoking medium. But I smoke joints all day when I'm outside of my house. Unless it is location and medium that affect the high. This touches on some interesting things I think, but it isn't in the scope of this thing that I am writing.* * *It is not a surprise then that this form of smoking is the most known and recognizable form of smoking marijuana. It is also the one that usually has the most rules. This is perhaps due to its fragile and transient nature.So here are some rules that I personally follow and most people seem to agree with. They differ a bit from the poster rules that I see posted from time to time. It is less fascist and more flexible. In no particular order, they are:* *Always pass to the left.* Unless you want to pass to the right sometime, that's cool too.* *Never toke longer than everyone else.* People usually chill with the j and puff-puff-pass is something you do when the j is nearing the end so everyone gets a few last small hits. It can be played as the Two Toke Indian variation where you have to hold the two hits in until the joint comes back to you.* *Person who rolled lights the joint.* The roller has the option of offering the start to someone else, but it is polite to decline. If the roller is sitting on the left of the person who supplied the weed, then the roller can pass it to the person who provided after he lights/smokes it a bit and then return it to regular rotation after that. This is usually done in large circles so the person who provided doesn't have to wait the longest.* *Don't microphone it.** *If you let the joint go out through sheer neglect, you must pass it on.* It is acceptable to light it and then pass it on.* *Try avoiding passing a soaked end of the joint.* It's not cool.* *Have fun.* It's not like you have a choice, anyway. ;)
zufoj	-54558	1347574752	AskReddit	I don't understand why people cry at weddings. What's another (seemingly) well-known occurrence which you don't understand?	Do people even cry at weddings or is that a myth? I've only been to two weddings in my life and I didn't see people crying (except the mother of the bride).Why would people even cry at weddings? It's not that catastrophic that you have to weep for the couple as if they're at their funeral and it's not that fantastic that you cry from joy as if you just beat cancer. I never understood it and probably never will.Anything else?

I gained a lot of weight (185 at my biggest). This year I have been trying to eat natural foods, organic if possible. I've been more active with swimming, riding my bicycle, playing sports, etc. In the last few weeks I have started a workout regime and have been eating right. I lost weight and I am still losing it. I am at a "normal" size now so I am working on toning up.It all happened because I got really really high one night and re-evaluated my life. Decided that living as naturally as possible is the way to go for me. Food is literally what makes our body, yet we give it the least amount of thought in a day. People will choose between two identical televisions for hours, but won't give a second thought to eating at McDs or something.What we eat matters a lot.But this isn't a Trees Weight watchers or whatever. We can share recipes, healthy alternatives for munchie foods, discuss diets and workouts, &amp;c.

About differences between smoking back then and now, health effects over the long term, etc. Please upvote this for visibility. It's a self post so I don't get any karma. But you already knew that. :)I don't know if there are AMAs in /r/trees but I don't feel like this topic would be appropriate in the regular AMA subreddit.So here are the first five questions:1. How was weed back then when comparing the taste, strength, and effects to today's weed? Did you also see marijuana quality improve over the years?2. Has it had any strong adverse effects on your health? Especially the lungs. Also include if you smoke cigarettes as well.3. How were sessions back then? Did you meet in basements, in the forests or was it more relaxed back?4. How much weed was "normal" to buy/consume? For example, today in a session with 5 people I think it is average to smoke anywhere from a quarter to an ounce, today. 5 people will go through 10 big js and loads of bowl packs.5. What were "stoners" like? What was the stereotype of a person who smokes marijuana back then?

I started off not really liking it, but by pushing myself every day I have come to love it and the benefits it provides. You will end up feeling more fit overall if you do it.Anyone else a fan of running?

That's a 38.41% voter turnout. Most of the other countries on the planet have a voter turnout of over 50%.I downloaded the spreadsheet of latest voter turnout data from the [IDEA voter turnout database](http://www.idea.int/vt/viewdata.cfm); I removed the countries with no data and sorted them in ascending order. I could only upload it to 4shared (cause I don't know any good filesharing sites for small files) and [this is the link](http://www.4shared.com/office/Y_dYdMf3/voterturnout.html).Have Americans lost faith in the government? Do they not care any more because they realize there isn't a real difference between the republicans and democrats? Do they want a third choice? Or do most Americans just not care about who runs the country as long as their SUV keeps going and the TV stays on.

14dwan	-54558	1354806587	startrek	Let's talk about J.J. Abrams' Star Trek films	I don't like them, and here's why. These are two comments I made in the ST:ID announcement and teaser threads. Didn't get much attention but I'm hoping it might get some responses and start a discussion here. I really want to know what other Star Trek fans think. I grew up watching Star Trek and I can say that it helped shaped me into the person I am today. Seeing J.J. Abrams ruin it breaks my heart.**First one sucked, why wouldn't the second one?**It was a good action film, but a bad Star Trek film. There was no dialogue, no message, just big spaceships shooting at each other and Simon Pegg comedy relief (I think Simon Pegg is awesome, btw).And now it's a guy looking at the ruins of London... what the fuck is that all about? "Into darkness"?We haven't had a Star Trek film since Nemesis, with [spoiler](/s "Data dying to save everyone, finally attaining the most human characteristic of all -- self-sacrifice for your fellow man. Going against the self-preservation which is inherently in him. Lore falls prey to that, especially after getting emotions and going on a nihilistic pursuit of whatever the fuck he wants across the universe. I am sad for Data, but Data's story could not have ended any other way.")So why not build on that?Star Trek canon spans several hundred years, with tons of shit going on, all the time. Dominion wars from DS9 were particularly exciting, with Sisko being forced to balance being the emissary and his spiritual commitment to Bajor and being the only starfleet captain who can successfully defend the alpha quadrant from the Founders/Dominion/Jem'Hadar.What about the Trek favorite villains, the Borg? They can travel through time. They never stop.And what did we get in the first movie? An alternate universe (codeword for 'cop out') high school drama where the star is an all-American bad-ass who has a super-logical geek hinder his awesomeness while he tries to avenge his father and fuck the distant, but independent and smart Uhuru.Fuck JJ Abrams and fuck "Into Darkness". That's exactly where he's taking the franchise.EDIT:Furthermore, Star Trek has always been/tried to be relevant to current events, Kirk kissing Uhuru in the 60s during segregation, Uhuru being a non-maid black woman, an actual officer, USS Sarajevo in DS9 during the 91-95 war in the Balkans, etc.The Ferengi are a very fascinating, but quite understated race. Sure Quark is on DS9 and there are many episodes about them. But why not really explore them? Especially now with the 99/1% rhetoric, the rich hoarding money, Wall Street/Republicans preventing tax increases, and so on, the Ferengi could be awesome to watch.Compare their lust for gold-pressed latinum to the ideals of a new federation (which is money-less, btw) becoming a major player on the space scene. How the Ferengis can try and influence Federation activities, perhaps re-examine some previous conflicts (or create new ones in the future), &amp;c.Point is, there is so much more to star trek than space ships, phasers and photon torpedos. Star Trek is so popular because it wasn't just a technological feast for the eyes, but for the brain as well. However, making a Star Trek movie requires reading and familiarizing oneself with canon, it's much easier for Abrams to just say "fuck it, it's an alternate universe so we can do whatever the fuck we want".When will the story lines merge? How will they merge? Is this now Star Trek canon as well or do we dismiss it? Abrams fucked up.* * ***I don't know what that [Star Trek: Into Darkness] is, but it definitely isn't Star Trek.**I'm short on time so I will discuss only one (major) aspect of why it isn't Star Trek. It's right in the synopsis.&gt;With a personal score to settle, Captain Kirk leads a manhunt to a war-zone world to capture a one man weapon of mass destruction.J.J. Abrams is making a run-off-the-mill American-style action film. But before I talk about that let me explain what made Star Trek so great.Star Trek is a very progressive show. They have never glorified one character as a super-hero without faults. The ship captain's come close but that illustrates the rigorous selection, training and experience required to become a starship captain. Not everyone possesses the qualities that Picard, Riker, Sisko have. In the show it is clear that these characters were not born captains, but years of service in Starfleet made them into captains.Picard talks about his previous service and his time in the academy. Riker was offered his own starship after being the 1st officer on the Enterprise, where he was able to learn from Captain Picard. One could argue that this symbolic growth was shown in Riker's beard. He gets on the Enterprise clean-shaven, even though a commander, he's not as experienced as the crew of the Enterprise (the flagship). As he matures, he grows a beard, becomes more confident and shows true leadership skills. In early episodes he even makes mistakes.In Star Trek a point is made over and over: one man cannot accomplish everything by himself. What makes Picard great and confident is that he has his crew behind him, and by extension whole of Starfleet. Everyone on that ship has a specific role to fill and Picard's success depends on everyone fulfilling that role completely. That is why Riker never accepts command of his own starship, because the role in which he shines is XO. Him and Picard make a team with he rest of the crew. You never see Geordi performing medical procedures, or Dr. Crusher piloting the enterprise, they probably have basic training but that's not their role.Picard, Riker and Sisko were not born great captains, leaders and diplomats. They learned it. Now the new Abrams' Star Treks.How does it begin? Kirk is fucking around. What happens after? Kirk is getting drunk, fighting and fucking around. What happens then? Kirk is at the academy fucking girls. What happens then? Kirk is on the Enterprise manning all the consoles and commanding the ship. Wait, what?! From fucking around to one man army doesn't seem like a very logical progression to me.Does he at least have a team? Oh yes, he has Spock, the logical geek who wants to shit on Kirk's show. He has the comedy relief engineer (I like Simon Pegg, btw) and "the girl" who despite it being 300 years in the future still has to behave as if she has something to prove to all the men in the room. This is Star Trek, bitch, everybody is equal. Oh yeah, and Bones, the recklessly-cynical-but-smart doctor who's the main side-kick. And Kirk can do all of their jobs, he just doesn't, because he's so great.Now in the new one (from what I can gather in the teaser) Kirk is chasing the main bad guy. He doesn't want to be the captain of a ship any more, he wants to save Earth, on his own. I imagine that commanding troops on the ground requires different skills and experience from captaining a spaceship. They may be trained for it, but it's not their role, and in Star Trek everyone has a role and a job.And that is how every American action movie goes. You have a not-very-exceptional-hero who somehow finds his inner power and becomes a super-hero and saves the day. No experience, no learning. Once you complete Starfleet Academy (did he even finish in the first one?) you know everything there is to know and you're ready to go. That is not how the real world works. That is definitely not in the spirit of Star Trek. In the real Star Trek after the Academy you're an ensign on a ship, doing lowly tasks to gain experience. For example Geordi is shown to be instructing unseasoned ensigns in the engine room. They make mistakes, but that's how they learn.Abrams' Kirk? Why he can fly a starship and command a crew no big deal. He's out of the academy so he knows everything, just like someone getting out of college. His dad was the captain so he knows everything. Commanding a ship is as easy as telling people what to do, right? Wrong. Remember the TNG episode where Deanna Troi wants to move up in rank to commander, and there's a super-hard test? A test with multiple sections (including engineering) and a really hard command section which she fails several times? Just a glimpse of what it really takes to eventually become a captain. Abrams' Kirk doesn't need this, he's Captain United Federation of Planets, or Captain Planets for short. He can do anything.The Abrams' Star Treks are devoid of any real meaning, character development and plot line. They are big-budget action films with the name Star Trek on it, because they own the rights to it. The only resemblance to Star Trek they have is the character/ship names.

For example, Frozen Mallet gives you +700 health and +30 attack damage and is built from a Phage and a Giant's Belt.If you have a Phage and a Giant's Belt, that means you already have the +600 health and +20 attack damage. If you hover over Frozen Mallet it will still say +700 HP, +30 AD.Why doesn't the top-level item reflect what you already bought? Then if you had a Giant's Belt and a Phage, when selecting Frozen Mallet it would say +100 HP, +10 AD, which is what you'd get by buying a FM on top of the aforementioned items.That way, if you get items which can go into several build items (e.g. Zeal into Statikk and Phantom Dancer) you'd be able to know exactly what kind of improvements to expect.I don't follow build guides but build as I go along. I would like to be able to quickly choose between several build items without trying to figure out which item will give me the stats I want to improve given my already-owned items.

19594r	-54558	1361734735	WritersGroup	Happiness (four short paragraphs I felt like writing down)	So, I realized something. Happiness isn't something you find in the objects around you, the places you see or even the activities you do. True happiness comes from inside and it enables you to appreciate all and any of your experiences, good and bad. The best and the worst part about it all is that only you can make yourself truly happy.Sometimes, the world overwhelms us and the next step becomes hard. Sometimes it uplifts us and we are breezing through life. But those are experiences, which only affect us in a meaningful way because we give them meaning. It doesn't matter which way you go or how far; it doesn't matter where life takes you or how long it takes you, you are always the one responsible for your happiness.The happiness you find for yourself isn't the opposite of sadness. It goes beyond the feelings of happy and sad. The happiness you find is the happiness that we all already have. And not just our species, but everyone who gets a chance to exist. A chance to experience a slice of eternity. We are one of the many, or the few depending how you look at it, who get to see what it's all about. You won the greatest lottery in the universe. And that's awesome.For you, just like for everybody else on this planet, from the inception of the universe, of time and space, until thirteen point eight billion years later, everything that had to go right has gone right. Not only that, but on this tiny planet, orbiting this tiny sun, your ancestors managed to survive horrors through history and you're the result. It almost wasn't you, because you were one in a several billion sperm who managed to get inside the egg. And that's something to be happy about.

I love that there's stuff happening everywhere.I'm here for two weeks for riotfest. I want to check out stuff off the beaten path. I enjoy reading, I'd like to go to some cool used bookstores. I like beer, good locally brewed beers and beer gardens/bars. I'm very open minded and enjoy visiting unusual places, I'd like to go to some historical sites, like the Haymarket Martyrs' Monument and things of that nature because I know this city has had a lot happen. I'd like to visit some parks and gardens as well. Recommendations for theaters and plays also welcome.Any suggestions? :)Edit: Oh yeah, I'm a vegetarian, where are the good vegan/vegetarian places to eat?

28e0x7	-54576	1403029390	starbucks	Minimum hours possible per week	Hey erybody, I have a question: What is the minimum amount of hours you have to work per week and still be a partner? I ask because I have an internship lined up and will have to shift to weekends only, yet I still want to keep my job until the internship results in a better position. I'll be able to work the 8.5 hours Saturday and Sunday, resulting in 16 hours possible, but will that be enough to allow me to stay an employee despite the chance that I won't be booked for 16 hours? My manager isn't too fond of allowing partners to be weekend only and I'm afraid she will make me choose between Starbucks and the internship. So do I have any ground to stand on and say I legally cannot be fired because I am still available for the 16 required hours?

32tjnf	-54588	1429201652	DestinyTheGame	[Question]Skip Vog Conflux glitch still working??	Hi guys, this morning me and two other teammates tried to skip the conflux part by using the glitch. Basically what we did is me to activate the conflux and back to orbit(leave the fireteam). and all my teammates are waiting for at the first chest.However, they waited about 10 mins and nothing showed up. It supposed to say Templar summons legions. So I am just wondering is this glitch working or it be patched after 1.1.2.

I'm always pretty good about pulling off to the right of the road (I'm in Canada) and putting on my hazard lights so that you can all get by me and do your work.  I'm shocked at how poorly and slowly most people react!Today I watched a car drive left into oncoming traffic to free up their lane to a Police car approaching from behind - it was very nearly a big crash.

qzcpz	-54610	1331905606	AskReddit	When people in riots flip cars...	Hi, I'm wondering about flipping a car on to its roof.  In riots, it always seems to happen and i wonder what the forces are?  Does the suspension on the down side squat once the other side is lifted (potentially shifting the centre of gravity)?  Second, would outriggers from beneath at the corners (think F1 or shock absorbers that could lock or even squat) make it harder to flip a Police car?  Im not suggesting it would be worthwhile fitting equipment to all of the police cars to save a couple every year but Im wondering if there is an engineer or physicist who could express any change in the force needed.  Thanks, have fun!

I want someone to make a simple app that makes a loud noise when he phone is unplugged to serve as a security device.  Think of the phone playing a ringtone on loud of a person yelling "I'm stealing an iPhone over here!"To disengage the app would be a key code.What do you think?

1xonnh	-54610	1392182328	CarAV	Help, I broke my Porsche!	Hi guys, I'm willing to let you make fun of me if you'll help too!I recently bought a 2006 Porsche Cayman that came with Bose stereo that included a 6 disc changer in the front.  I was looking to add a connection for my iPod and was trying to do it on the cheap.I read about a method where you splice in an RCA cable into the source cable leading to the deck from the changer.  I was trying to do that and as sometimes happens I had trouble making the connections and I ran out of wire when it kept ripping or getting stripped.  I left the cd changer unplugged before I did any more damage.  So the cd changer is no longer recognized by the head unit (which doesn't bother me) but now I have no audio at all:  no radio, no in-dash cd.  Did I blow a fuse?  Any thoughts.  How do I fix this?  Would it help if I slide the head unit out and remove the cable leading to the now disconnected changer?Tldr:  I was dumb, messed up my cd changer and now my radio won't make any sound at all.Thanks guys!

1xkisj	-54614	1392080555	Frugal	Help me organize my money	I've been poor my entire life. My parents did well when I was first born but by the time my youngest sister was born, fast food work wasn't enough for the family anymore. I never had someone I can emulate in terms of personal expense. Now I just started college (southern California) and starting working part time in fast food. This seems good, and it should be considering that my tuition is basically paid for. I should have money left over every month to save. But a few months ago my cat needed surgery. I borrowed somewhere around $700 from my boyfriend for this. I've paid back about $150 so far. I would have finished paying him back Were it not that I CAN'T STOP EATING OUT. I KNOW it's a habit I have to get rid of. But I just can't seem to do it. Please help me. I am tired of just buying crap all of the time. If I didn't do it, I'd have paid back my boyfriend already and had put a down payment on a car. Please consider I'm a full time college student, part time worker who commutes on bus and foot. I don't have time anymore. I know the best things I need to cultivate over time, but is there something I can do that'll curb my behavior?
20p63q	-54614	1395122133	PMDD	I thought I overcame depression two years ago.	Two years ago when I was severely depressed, I was very irrationally jealous for a very long time. I began driving away my SO. I became desperate. At the peak of it, we actually broke up for a few days. I was on the verge of killing myself. I don't know if I ever overcame depression at all, but everything that was ever a problem resurfaced again now that I started school and working. I don't seem to be able to handle stress very well. Recently I decided to drop out. And I'm heartbroken about it. But I can't go five nights in a row every week without sleep for much longer. I worked so much to graduate high school and start uni (first gen graduate) that it tears me to pieces to have to temporarily leave school. Anyway, I'm back to being my insecure, jealous self. I've gained some weight recently, I've been losing hair and my SO recently got a great job where he has a lot of female attention. And when I bring up the fact that this female attention bothers me, all he really has to say is, "I thought we were over this already," and that he can't really avoid attention so there's no point trying. I'm at a loss of words. I seriously don't even know what to do/say. I froze when he told me that. I just need some advice. Thanks.
21qigm	-54614	1396169853	childfree	My doctor won't sterilize me.	I recently went to my doctor for family planning. I told the nurse that I was there to make an appointment for sterilization. She was very surprised. She told me I'm the first 19 year old who went to the clinic for such a thing. She spoke to the doctor about my wishes. And he refused to provide me with this service with regards to my age. Now, I understand he doesn't want liability, but it still enraged me. The conversation I had with the nurse pretty much sums up my experience with the rest of the world. She asked me, "But what if you fall in love and change your mind?" "Umm.., I've been with my SO for almost five years and neither of us want kids.""So then why doesn't he get a vasectomy instead?" "He is? But *I* still don't want kids?? I may not end up with him, so I still need the procedure done on me""They doctor is very strict. He doesn't consider anyone under 25 or who hadn't already had kids.""Wow, he's really missing the point, isn't he? I've been sexually active for almost five years. Only condoms (which irritate my insides) Will soon cause an accident. The whole *point* is to *never* be pregnant and have kids!" "I could prescribe you the pill of you want. There's really not much I can do for you here.""I understand. But no thank you, hormonal birth control makes me suicidal. I'll just go to planned parenthood. Hopefully it's not the same as here." /rantEdit: Wow, thank you all for such great support. I really only wanted to rant. I realise it may be very difficult for me to get the procedure done any time soon. But I didn't even know there were doctors in my area that *would* provide me with the procedure. I just hope my age won't be a factor with them either. Like I mentioned before, I understand my doctor doesn't want to be responsible for any future legal issues, and I understand him. I was mostly angry because he didn't speak to me directly, and was dismissive even though he was just across the hall. I will try my local planned parenthood first and then I'll go through the list of doctors on the side bar.I'm so glad this subreddit exists!

Everything went fine, transaction and handing of the food. Only difference is that he just sat there. Normally this means a customer is waiting for something or wants something else. So I go over to ask him what was up. Before I even say anything, he hands me his drink whilst saying "I don't know where to put this." I was about to ask if he wanted a cup holder when he cuts me off and says, "Oh well!" with a smile and just sped off. It was weird.

29y9nf	-54614	1404626702	candytostrangers	My compliments to Drive-Thru customers.	I try my best to compliment (big or small) all drive-thru customers when I'm on shift. It doesn't always happen because people can be douches, but I try.For context, I'm female (19yo). A guy my age came by the drive-thru wearing a sick Rage Against The Machine t-shirt. I told him I loved his tee, and he beamed. Then *he* wished *me* a wonderful day! That never happens. What a sweet guy.
2apid8	-54614	1405376545	candytostrangers	I paid a guy's bus fare.	I travel by bus everywhere I go. As a full-time student, I get a monthly discount for a pass. I usually pay $33/mo so that I can have unlimited rides in my area. So the money I carry around is just for emergencies/lunch money. Yesterday as I was boarding the bus, a guy asked me if I had change for $5 so he could pay the $1.25 fare. I told him I didn't. All I had was a twenty, a one and a few coins. So I just gave him enough for his fare. He kept thanking me and asking how he could pay me back. I just told him he didn't have to.
2f7xmu	-54614	1409622446	TalesFromRetail	I had to call the cops last night.	Boy, do I have a story to tell.. [Very Long]So I work at a fast-food restaurant, usually during the day, but I was closing last night. My job was to operate the drive-thru until 10pm and and clean the dining room from 10-11pm. At about 9:55pm, a car shows up to the outside speaker. I heard a bit of an argument but I figured it was just a couple arguing over what to buy. I waited a bit until a heard a drunken guy (DG from now on). He ordered 5 dollar chickens sandwiches and 2 value chillies. &gt;**Me:** *Anything else for you tonight?*&gt;**DG:** *No that's it.*&gt;**Me:** *Okay, that'll be $10.39 at the last window.* (Keep in mind that we haven't had dollar chillies for almost two years now) So I look out the window and I see a car speeding up to my window. And in that car I see a woman [LW]... Definitely not the order I took. &gt;**LW:** *Can I just have a large lemonade?*I'm a bit frustrated at this point because to me, it seemed like she just drove through and didn't feel like fucking ordering at the speaker. Whatever. I'm starting to get her lemonade ready when a man shows up to the window. He's leaning over and hands me just a $10. I can smell the booze on him, and he's looking at me too suggestively... So before one of the closing manager leaves (tall, buff guy, TBG), I call him over to help me. And then, I see the lemonade girl high-tail it out of there. And the man who walked up to the window wasn't even phased... I realize what had happened instantly. He waited until someone showed up to the speaker so that he could order. The lemonade woman noped out of there asap like any other smart person would. There I am, waiting for the manager to come an help me. I hadn't told him what I needed help with. At this time another car pulls up to the speaker so I have to take this other order. Behind me, the drunk guy is saying rude things to me of a sexual nature. Normally we would have told him we can't take his order if he didn't drive up in a car, but since his order was almost done before anyone realized that, we figured we'd just give him his order so he'd leave. Except the sandwich-maker needed one more chicken patty to finish the order, and since he hadn't noticed the commotion, he didn't tell us right away. At this point TBG leaves, figuring that the other manager (short girl, SG) and the other employees could handle the dude. SG takes control of the drive thru at 10pm so I can get started on the dining room, which is already closed to the public. She asks him to step aside so that she could attend to the other customers. At this time, I started cleaning the dining room. But DG starts knocking on the door. I ignore him because I'm not supposed to let anyone in after 10pm. He becomes more and more impatient in the course of just 30 seconds. SG tells me to just let him in. So I do. This is the scariest moment of my life. He just looks at me so gruesomely, so savagely.. He didn't tell me anything at that point. He just walked past me. So *naturally*, I just hide in the bathroom. I wait there for a few minutes, figuring that it wouldn't take more than 5 minutes to get his order out. I walked out eventually. I went to the break room in the back to grab my iPod. As I passed by, I noticed an employee is finishing with his order. I walk back to the front and another employee motions me to just stay back. There was some arguing for about two or three minutes, and then he leaves. (All of this is inaudible to me). So I ask my co-workers what had happened. The gist of that was that he was asking my coworkers to call me so that he could talk to me. He told them that he wanted to take me off of work and make me have sex with him. My co-worker tells him at this point to go home, he's drunk. To just chill out. But DG took it the wrong way. And he threatened to fuck him up. He left saying he was going to come back for him after work to fuck him up. Well, no one took his threats seriously, so we all just went back to work. Unfortunately, he came back an hour later. &gt;**DG:** *Where's my dollar chilli?! I ordered two dollar chillies and you guys fucked me over and charged me extra!? He was banging on the drive thru window. He saw SG and started making very dirty and rude hip motions.&gt;**DG:** *"I want you to eat it. I want  to feed you my penis. I want to feed you penis. Where's that Hindu girl? I want her to eat my penis, too."* (I'm not Hindu. All of us are Hispanic, I just happen to look a little Hindu, I guess..) &gt;....*"I want that Hindu girl to belly dance for me. I wanna fuck her all night. I want her to be my bitch. Why she hiding? You, I wanna fuck you so hard tonight. You and Hindu girl." &gt;**SG to Me:** *He's not gonna leave, huh?*&gt;**Me:** *Nope, should I call the cops?*&gt;**SG:** *Yup*So I called the cops. The didn't arrest him. They just got him to leave. I figured they felt bad for him. He had just gotten out of jail the night before, according to him when he was talking to the officers. He was the scariest person I have ever seen in my life.
2gjhi9	-54614	1410853273	relationships	My [19F] boyfriend [22M] of five years just broke up with me and I feel completely lost.	He is the most beautiful person I have ever met in my entire life. He has the sweetest heart and the most loving personality. He broke up with me because he had been falling out of love for the past year and he says he hasn't felt anything in the last two months. I sensed it, but he always reassured me. I'm not angry with him. I can't be. I love him too much to blame him for anything. But my heart is broken into pieces. This is my first true relationship. I don't know how to cope. Please help. TL;DR **The best person in the world just dumped my ass and I need help coping**

I've been sexually active with the same guy for five years and I'm just tired of never cumming with him. For the record, I always finish if I do it myself.
2of5jl	-54614	1417829177	relationships	Is it worth opening this can of worms?	I (19F) and my boyfriend (22M) of 5 years have been having problems revolving trust and jealousy very recently. We broke up early October, and when we were having our final conversation, he admitted to many things he had lied about or purposely never told me about in the past few months leading up to the end of our relationship.As you can tell, we got back together. We have been having a steady relationship for the past month. But among those things he admitted to, there is one I can't seem to brush off. On many occasions he didn't go home to sleep. He stayed over at his coworkers' homes (young women) and went to parties without me knowing anything about them. On one such occasion, he and his coworkers booked a suite at a hotel for one of the girls birthdays. He got drunk and slipped into a Jacuzzi with them. I saw a picture well after we started dating again, which broke my heart. He was never like that... I know, people change. And he has told me that he's going to change for me, he's not going to go out with them anymore, he's going to leave his job before Christmas, he's going to make an effort to see me more often, he's going to stop lying to me, etc... And I believe he has good intentions.. But I can't help that it bothers me that he's slept with other women in a single room. I can't help but think that he was there with them, numerous times and I found out about it all later after we broke up. He abhors cheating. And he knows I would absolutely break if he were to ever cheat on me. So I know, that no matter how great his intentions are to never lie to me, this is the one thing he would never admit to. But I also know that if he did cheat, it was out of a mixture of drunken carelessness and relationship dissatisfaction followed by guilt. Sometimes I wonder if he broke up with me because he couldn't handle the guilt.. Anyway, because of how much our relationship changed in the past month for the better, I'm very concerned about opening this can of worms. If he did cheat on me, I know he regrets it and wouldn't do it again. I know it'll kill me to never know the truth, but it'll kill me more to know if he did cheat on me, even though I know he wouldn't do it again. The guilt would kill him. Should I proceed on believing he never cheated on me? Ignorance is bliss..Should I keep this whole situation at the back of my mind, and potentially never allow myself to trust him again? Or should I somehow concoct a plan to find out the truth and go from there? I know the pain would be unbearable, and he would also hurt in the process of admitting to it, but I don't think he'll ever change unless he admits to his biggest faults. So is worth it? Do you sometimes wish you never knew?**TL;DR Is it ever better to never find out if you were cheated on? My longtime boyfriend may have cheated on me and I'm torn.**

2qkm7t	-54614	1419724188	AskVet	Supplements for red blood cell count in cats?	**Edit for those who might come back to this post: I've decided to put him down. I did not have the resources. My natural reaction is to post about how great of a cat he was, but I hope you just take my word for it. I hope me being there helped the process for him. It was a terribly difficult decision to make.**Cat Male3 years old Neutered American Short hair Was around 12 lbs, lost around 4 since Dec. 24thHas feline leukemia virusWill not eat, drink, or move. Eyes are almost always dilated. White gums, lips, nose, paws, etc. Lots of drooling.Smells like pee, ammonia maybe? Will not groom self, Peed himself in his bed. Lost weight very rapidly. All above symptoms began Dec. 24th. General lethargy and drooling and.bad smell has been happening for a few months. General location, San Bernardino and Los Angeles county. I'm at the vet's office right now. My cat has a very low red blood cell count. I'm already paying $68 for a consultation and $31 for blood work. The nurse came in and told me that there will be further tests needed to determine the cause of his low blood cell count. I'm afraid I already know the answer, he has the feline leukemia virus. He's been lethargic for a while now, but it wasn't until Christmas eve that he stopped eating, drinking, moving at all and losing weight and his color in his lips and gums. I'm very afraid and I need to bring him to receive a proper diagnosis and treatment. But all I have is enough for this visit and my bus fare for the rest of the week, until I get paid on January 4th. Meanwhile, I know his health is declining because he's not receiving proper nutrition (both from not eating and having a low red blood cell count.) **Are there any over-the-counter supplements that you would recommend to help him keep a higher red blood cell count until I can bring him back next week?**
32b0ih	-54614	1428814631	candytostrangers	A customer offered me her home.	Although this happened a while back, I still think of this woman fondly. She's 70 and lives on her own. One morning, 6am, I had just arrived to work after a tough argument with my dad. He's not necessarily abusive but he has been making it tough. Anyway, before I started work, I was crying in my car. I fixed my makeup and walked in. She had been eating her breakfast in the dining room when she saw me in my car. That sweet woman asked me what was wrong and eventually I told her simply that I was tired of living at home as a 20 year old with my father when I could live anywhere else.And she offered me her spare room for $200/mo (a steal in LA!!). I've been living with her for about 3 months now but I am now paying the utilies with $200/mo rent. I have a full time job afterall.
33y7u2	-54614	1430077638	AskWomen	AskWomen, what experience has caused you to avoid conversation with men out in public?	I was on my way home from work on the bus last November. An Indian guy sat next to me and he seemed very friendly and kind so he and I just spoke about school and stuff until he got off. He asked for my number so I told him I could just find him on fb. I lent him my phone to look himself up but while he did that, he sent a text message to himself from my phone. Great..now he has my number. That very same night, he texts me and tells me all of these very "romantic" things he'd love to do with me (read: creepy things). I just met this guy and that very night he's telling me he's picturing himself making out with me!! I just stopped replying to everything and the messages stopped coming. But now, I made a WhatsApp account. My young cousin broke her arm and my aunt is keeping us notified in the group chat. I guess the thing lets everyone that has your number know you just made an account or something??? And this is why I never ever talk to strangers on the bus anymore:http://imgur.com/ksaFBlPOh yeah, and I've been engaged to my fiance for 5 years. He KNOWS this amd still won't leave me alone. I'm not asking for advice, but what creepy shit have made it so other guys regard you as "bitchy" and "stuck up."

If God is good, it is by a definition of good that He determined, which he can only do because of His might. Therefore, God cannot be held to be good by his own standard, and he certainly isn't good by my --or, generally, humanity's-- standards. (Slaughter of infants, infinite torture, etc.)Please only respond directly if you actually disagree with me. No devil's advocates, please.

23w3q3	-54656	1398371700	changemyview	CMV: Common arguments against gun control that I think totally lack merit.	Argument the 1st: Criminals break laws, so they'll just break gun control laws! Flaw: The vast majority of guns used in crimes in the US were originally legally owned. If those guns had not been legally owned, they would not now be illegally owned. Reducing legal ownership also dries up the supply of illegal guns.Argument the 2nd: The Second Amendment!Flaw: Aside from anything to do with a well-ordered militia, we've repealed amendments before. The constitution is amendable for a reason: when a law that previously worked stops working, we can change it.Argument the 3rd: The government should fear the people!Flaw: If the citizen military of the United States ever full-out attacked the civilian population of the United States, no small-arms wielding militias are going to stop the best equipped force the world has ever seen. The government fears the populace because they rely on free, thinking citizens to carry out their policies and have no power beyond what power we voluntarily give them. Argument the 4th: People who want to kill someone will do it anyway, gun or no gun.Flaw: Guns are one of the most lethal weapons available. A gunshot wound is substantially less treatable than almost any other one can inflict, and guns are very effective at leaving multiple wounds. Other weapons are certainly effective, but if they were more effective than guns armed forces would be using them.Argument the 5th: People need guns to protect themselves from criminals!Flaw: Tasers (and other self defensive weapons) are more effective at incapacitating an attacker, less likely to accidentally kill anyone, easier to safely store, and less dangerous if turned against a member of the household.EDIT: Nobody has to answer all of these.

2arrq4	-54656	1405439579	changemyview	CMV: Limits on who can run for office are really limits on who voters are allowed to vote for.	I live in The States, but this probably applies elsewhere. I believe it sets a poor precedent that the government is allowed to set limitations on who may be voted into office. Democracy is based on the idea that people should be allowed to choose who leads them, and restricting those choices is useless and undemocratic. The only time a law that restricts the candidacy could even come into play is when the majority is willing to vote for an illegal candidate, which means the only possible scenario is one where voters cannot have the president they want.

I would've seen this on Cartoon Network probably around 1999. I think it was a series and this happened in the finale, but I'm not sure. Basically, I remember these two floating wooden R2D2 looking things that talked and were, like, mentor figures to the main character. One was red-themed and one was green-themed. In some big climactic moment, the two turned into monk/wizards and had staffs and fought two other, monk wizards. Yeah, this is weird, and I'm halfway believing I made it up.

3a3p2l	-54656	1434499070	changemyview	CMV: I shouldn't kill Hitler.	Let's assume I have a time machine, knowledge of the temporal/spatial coordinates of Hitler across his entire life, and means with which to end his life. However, I can only use this time machine once, so any alterations of history caused by my time machine are permanent.In the present, the holocaust has already happened. At this point in history, there is a fixed and finite quality of tragedy attached to it. However, as it stands, the Holocaust was not my fault. I wasn't alive at the time, and had no role in the buildup to these events.If I kill Hitler, I may prevent the particular tragedy that we know in history from happening. But if in preventing this tragedy, a new one that I didn't predict happens, this IS my fault. By altering time, all new fatalities can be directly linked to my action. In short, I would rather attempt to repair damage done by someone else than undo old damage and potentially cause new damage.&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

They must also breach the barrier around Ganondorf's castle, which will require the aid of all 6 sages.Assume your Street-tier can gain access to all equipment in the game in the same ways that Link can (for instance, people are weirdly willing to give the protagonist their personal posessions for little- or no- reason.) However,your character is not Link, and as such, *is not necessarily an expert with any random tool they just happen to find in a chest.* Simply owning a musical instrument *does not imply a sense of pitch or timing,* and normal people will *not* be able to swing a metal hammer hard enough to shatter stone. Also, keep in mind that Link is inhumanly durable in regards to getting sliced, smashed, burned, and blown to bits.Can your character defeat their enemies and save hyrule, without having to continue from death?Also, if necessary, your character may carry standard gear and replenish it from bushes and pots, but they may not, for example, simultaneously wear body armor and the Goron Tunic.
3dna65	-54656	1437154482	whowouldwin	Batman is haunted by a ghost with an internet connection.	An utterly intangible and undetectable intelligence has decided that it wants to kill Bruce Wayne. While this intelligence is incapable of physically affecting reality in any way, it has an ethereal (untraceable) internet connection with which it can access anything an ordinary internet user can. This intelligence, through spying on Bruce, will attempt to leak enough information to Batman's foes and the public to eventually get Bruce Wayne killed or, failing that, force him to retire Batman permanently.Assuming this ghost always knows in which direction Bruce Wayne is, can the spirit do this and how quickly/easily?

3fo980	-54656	1438639894	changemyview	CMV: Osteopathic Medicine should be phased out, and anything of objective value within it should be rolled into standard medical schooling.	Osteopathic Medicine is based on utter quackery. However, modern osteopathic schooling typically claims to have put behind it everything associated with its pseudo-scientific origins, in favor of just using the words "holistic" and "treat the patient, not the disease," along with other lines frequently abused by homeopaths and naturopaths. I recognize that, in practice, a majority of training at an osteopathic school is nearly identical to that at an allopathic (evidence-based) medical school.On the face of it, I see nothing of any unique value associated with osteopathic medicine. The parts that are "just like allopathic medicine" seem to be just as effective as regular medicine. The parts that end up associated with naturopathic treatments, hollistic remedies, and actual osteopathic manipulation are all total hogwash, and only harm the public's understanding of doctors, medicine, and science (while lining the pockets of those who take advantage of patients that don't know better.) It would better serve the interest of public health (along with public science education) if DO programs were rolled into MD programs, leaving behind any association with the technique's roots and other forms of modern quackery. If there is any advantage to Osteopathic schooling, I would love to see some evidence of it, because I haven't yet. However, even if this evidence exists, that merely means that medical schooling has something to gain (and I in no way mean to imply that allopathic medical schooling is perfect) by incorporating these particular factors._____&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

3fobko	-54656	1438640919	AskHistorians	When did people stop believing in mythical creatures?	I was reading about the [amphisbaena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphisbaena) and the wikipedia article mentions that it was "debunked" by Thomas Browne, though the statement is not properly sourced. This got me thinking about historical debunkings that must have happened, such as those of dragons, unicorns, and fairies. I know that each of these still has groups of people that believe in them today, but I think I am correct in assuming that belief in creatures like these has generally declined over time. My question is, what conditions and discoveries caused the transition from "commonly accepted" to "mythical?" Are there any resources you might point me towards on the history of skepticism, particularly in regards to mythical creatures? Thank you for helping me out!Note: I used European examples, but I'd be thrilled to hear about African or Asian skepticism too!

Uthgerd promptly attempted to end my life. I reloaded the save and sent her home before I went beast form. After I dispatched the troll, I followed after Her to get my stuff back.

n5q26	-54685	1323398396	skyrim	Benor, Why you no move out of the way!?	Just like the title says. I want to hear all of your companion failures!!My favorite; (just happened today) I was in some strange mine helping a farmer out. I had benor with me in his full legendary dwarven armor and legendary glass battleaxe. I'm a full blown archer/sword and board (emphasis on the archer), so I sneak shoot everything with some poison. I usually one-shot the enemies I fight in these dungeons, and the stuff I don't kill is usually cleaved neatly in two by benor. Nonetheless, a mage falmor(spelling?) shows up and as I'm strafing at the bottom of the mine shaft to avoid his ice spikes, benor is being an idiot and standing there... Like a meat shield. Usually I'd be cool with that, but as he get's knocked down he plays dead! So I flip out and hide like a wuss... He gets up from his death pose and goes back to standing there... He did it twice and I had half a mind to help him sit down for good. We killed the mage and I notched my arrow to kill the last grunt when benor (beny for short) runs in front of me. =____=; He died.Oh well... no worse for wear. :) Now post your companions failures! I love reading them! :D

nskbr	-54685	1325013703	Maplestory	Scamming/Hacking PSA.	Foreword: This is a self post (duh) so no karma for me, please upvote because this needs to be seen.Hello fellow reddit maplers, I know the following will seem like common knowledge for most of you, which is why this post isn't for you! For everyone else, regardless of whether or not you've been hacked/scammed already, or if you've been lucky enough to avoid it, you need to read this.My little brother just got scammed today. He trusted someone online who was very persuasive and even though he had his doubts, he fell for the scammer's smooth moves. It says it on the maplestory home page, "Don't trust ANYONE with your user name or password!" I know that the sound of free stuff is a very tempting offer, because who doesn't love free stuff!? But don't do it. Please, for the sake of your account and your general happiness, just don't. HOWEVER, I have an alternative. If you really do want those 'free items' that they promise, make a separate account. When they ask for your info, give them the crappy account with NOTHING on it. If they're giving you free stuff, you can check after they log back out of your account. All you can lose is... A fake account. Now for the tricky part. If they do actually give you free items, they're now in a empty account. There really is no solid way to get them to your main account without the use of a REAL friend that you know FACE-TO-FACE that has a maple account or a second computer/laptop. If you don't have either of those, then I'm sorry... you're plum outtah luck. Again, this is a self-post so I get NO karma, please up vote so others can see!!!!TL;DR Make another account to give to potential 'free item' scammers to avoid getting your main account stolen/hacked. EDIT: Spelling

Also, if you can remember what games they've played through and want to list them, I can guarantee an upvote for you!  Before anyone asks, no not all of the let plays they have need to be finished, but I don't want someone with a bunch of half finished series' either. Thank you in advance!
r0a1m	-54685	1331949504	Minecraft	I need some help creating a server.	Foreword: I am not tech savvy. **You will need to explain it to me like I'm 5**.I'm in need of some assistance in creating a multiplayer server. It would be run off of a laptop or maybe a desktop. Either way, I would be using the computer I'm running it off of, to play it on. (if that's even possible.) Regardless, I have NO idea how to start one up!Once it is up, I'd also like to know how to have master admin controls, (i.e. Banning, giving items, promoting, giving powers, etc.). If this is too vague, let me know what I can provide more detail on in the comments!
rlem6	-54685	1333138213	AskReddit	Reddit, I'm a leader in the children's ministry at my church, and I need a good april fools joke. What are your suggestions?	I'm a teenager in one of the head leadership roles of this ministry. I'm going to be the ONLY leader there on Sunday, and I want to have fun with the kids. What are some harmless April Fools pranks or jokes that I can set up? Preferably without a big mess, if possible.  EDIT: The don't have to be based around religion. I know that's a touchy subject, which is okay because we're not super strict about these things. Also, the kids are 2-5th graders, so if it can be about something that they're familiar with, that would be even better!

sdtzl	-54685	1334642813	AskReddit	I'm too impatient for a throwaway, so I need some advice on hemorrhoids. What are your fixes or remedies if you have them?	I've been dealing with hemorrhoids for a few months now, and my sphincter is just RAW. EVERYTHING burns and I'm in agony a good portion of the day. If you have fixes, what are they?I myself, use tucks hemorrhoid pads, which are pads that you push up onto the sphincter and walk around with. The butt cheeks do a well enough job of holding it there, so it doesn't slip out. I also know that crapping has to be short or it makes them worse.
tlj7y	-54685	1336947668	Christianity	I have a question about how to deal with a LGBT child coming out to you.	EDIT: This is not a thread about loving my future child/children less, I simply was looking for some helpful advice. If you have no helpful advice, please go troll somewhere else. Thank you~Edit 2: It's been brought to my attention, that children are born homosexual. That goes with what I first EDITed. I won't love them less, it's again just trying to gain perspective on ways to deal with it. I'm pretty sure I know what I'd do, but feel free to continue giving advice.I'm only 17, but as a Christian, I've always wanted to know how you would respond to that.I read the FAQ about it, and I guess it really does come down to the kind of Christian you are; accepting, judgmental, etc. whatever. When I have children, I'm going to do my very best to raise them to be heterosexual. I have absolutely NO negative feelings towards anyone of the LGBT community, as it's not my place to judge someone or condemn them, but I also believe firmly that God created Adam, and then made a female companion for him. I'm also going to talk with my parents and some of my spiritual mentors about it, but I'd like to see what other people think about it.
vzhoj	-54685	1341334081	diablo3	Looking to change a very empty friends list.	HI! :) I know there's a few of these threads already, but I'm just now finding this subreddit, and those are months old. Basically, I just got Diablo 3 a few weeks ago, and I'm looking for some new friends. I'm a pretty nice guy, and I do have a skype. If you're up to making a new friend, let me know and I'll edit this again when I figure out what my ID is... I can't remember it. Again, I'm super nice, but I'm not the perfect gamer, so I may ask questions.

mw54a	-54697	1322750021	ForeverAlone	Don't give up.  A message from a fellow FA.	My brethren,I came here to tell my story.  Up until two months ago, I had never even held hands with a girl, much less kissed one or anything else.  I'm a mid-20s forever alone male which I'm sure you all know, is a terribly lonely existence, and to some extent it still is in ways.  Through most of my life, I was extremely socially awkward and depressed.  One day, I decided that enough was enough and started exercising and seeing myself in a positive light.  I was new in town, and knew NO ONE, so I went to a reddit meetup in my local city figuring I had nothing to lose.  From there, I met a beautiful girl, and have been having on-again/off-again relationship with her.  Nothing serious, but she still has sex with me from time to time, and my self-esteem has greatly improved from it.  While my performance is severely lacking, I'm at least getting experience and leveling up.My message to everyone on here is this:  DON'T GIVE UP.  I know it's hard and awkward meeting new people, but try a meetup in your local city for help.  It worked out awesome for me, and I'm sure with some effort that it will work out for you too!  There was a time when I thought I would always be FA, and while she isn't my girlfriend by any stretch of the imagination, I've gained so much from it.  However, I've had to put more work into it than I have anything else in life.  It's extremely difficult, but there is hope...
mxush	-54697	1322854420	dating_advice	Is it ok being the little spoon [25m]?	Hello,Recently I've started sleeping with this girl who I've developed feelings for as the time has gone on.  I've never had a girlfriend before, so it's kinda new to me.  When we wake up in the morning, I sometimes find myself being the little spoon (unintentionally), and I try to correct it almost instantly.  I'm concerned she might lose respect for me by being little spoon, but I like it!  My question is, is it ok being the male and being little spoon, or should I try to avoid it as best possible?

I'm starting to become more social though, so my question to you all is:   How is it being a T1 and trying to date?  Obviously, I wouldn't tell her I'm diabetic until I felt like she liked me as is (and couldn't easily dump me because of it), but I feel that that is kinda deceitful.Also, I know that she would want to help (huge hypothetical situation, as I don't see a girl becoming my "girlfriend" anytime soon), but I've got no more or less pride than any other male, and I feel like that would get old and make me feel like I'm sick or something.  I've read the awesome etiquette guide for non-diabetics, but I wouldn't want to just hand her a pamphlet.  Has it been a problem for any of you guys/girls before?Also, that's part of the reason I haven't gone on the pump.  I feel that I would be unfairly discriminated against on the dating scene.  Anyone else feel that way too?

ol78h	-54697	1326827848	diabetes	T1 burnout?  Rant warning.	So this may be just a rant, but I don't know where else to really vent.  I've been a T1 since I was a child (for 15+ years now), and am starting to feel the ill effects of diabetes on my body.  I've got a cut on my leg that I received New Year's Eve and it is just not starting to scab over (almost 3 weeks later), my kidneys actually hurt, and my vision is getting blurrier and blurrier everyday.  Everyday is more of a struggle than the one before it, and I just don't know how much longer I can go on living.  Waking up in the morning is the hardest thing I do in the day (VERY (a)effected by dawn phenomenon), and I know it's only a matter of time before I die from it.  I know I'm going to live a greatly shortened lifespan, and at this point, I just don't really care anymore.  At 25, I feel like I've already piqued physically, and it's just going to be an ongoing struggle from here on out.There is never going to be a cure for two reasons:1) Not enough people have it to invest the large sums of money/time/resources it takes to develop it   2) Obvious one, but the pharmaceutical companies make too much money from issuing a mandatory treatment.  Christ, I can remember being 1st diagnosed and seeing a pump that looks/functions EXACTLY like the ones we have today.  That was 15 years ago.  The only "innovation" I've seen actually come to fruition is the CGM, but I read about them years ago, and see them in the wild now.  Unfortunately, they cost too much, so most people don't get them (myself included).  The pharms. are fine with the status quo because all their expenses are net profit, and "if it ain't broke, don't fix it".The only reason I'm still alive is because it would crush my mother to lose her son.  That being said, after my mom goes, I really don't see myself carrying on much longer.  I don't have any friends (completely unrelated, I know, but it doesn't help), and I've never even seen another person with T1, much less talked to or befriended one.  It'd be nice to have someone else know what I go through on a daily basis, because I look fine on the outside, but inside it's a struggle just to get out of bed in the morning.  Realizing that my health is only going to get worse, and that the 2nd part of my life is going to be a lot harder (health wise) than the 1st, I'm losing my perspective.  I'm sorry for being so pessimistic, and I try to look on the bright side usually, but at this point, I guess I've just lost my will to care anymore...

pgavm	-54697	1328714139	diabetes	I give up.	I was looking at the site for the 'Tour de Cure' bicycle ride in the spring and their slogan is:  'Stop Diabetes'.  Sigh...it feels like even the ADA doesn't give a shit about T1s.  There's nothing T1s could have done to 'stop diabetes' and even the ADA is perpetuating the stereotype further.  I really wish they would just call T1 something else at this point, I would have suggested they change the name of T2, but the word 'diabetes' is already too synonymous with poor personal habits and lifestyle.  I know, not everyone who has T2 got it from a sedentary lifestyle, but the majority did and that's how everyone sees us T1s as well.  I was out with some people and this girl I'm into (who doesn't know I'm T1) the other day and somehow the conversation got steered toward diabetes.  Someone was eating some kind of gummi worm or something, and said "this is how you get diabetes."  I said, "well there's 2 types of diabetes." and left it at that, since I really didn't want to get into it, or out myself in front of the girl, but then she says "oh, yeah, diabetes is gross.  Paula Deen is gonna die from it."  I chose not to say anything and left shortly thereafter, more than a little upset.  I don't think we'll ever be able to really ingrain the differences in people's minds, especially since everyone thinks 'diabetes' is all the same.I guess I'm just frustrated.

pjfyj	-54697	1328888164	parkinsonsdisease	Father has Parkinson's	Hello,My father has been diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease for several years now.  They have had an extremely difficult time (no thanks to his stubbornness with doctors) with his diagnosis.  First they said it was probably ALS, then progressive supranuclear palsy, then they settled on Parkinson's, so that's what he is going with.The past few years have gotten significantly worse for him.  He cannot walk without the assistance of a walker, his only mobility is to walk to the bathroom (which he can still do for the time being), and then back to his chair.  His voice is extremely faint, and possess a glossy look in his eyes at all times.  Tremors are minimal, but mainly with his left hand.  His upright posture is very slumped.He takes an SSRI (I think) , Sinemet (again...I think), and a few other drugs, but that's about it.  He's been this way for roughly 3-4 years, but has seemed to level off in terms of his declining health.  My question is:  how much longer will this go one?  I love my father dearly, but sometimes I wished it was just all over so that he can be at peace, as much as I hate to lose my dad.  My mother takes care of him 24 hours a day, and it's a significant burden on her, I know, but she loves him, so she doesn't mind helping him.  I feel like an awful son for thinking this way, but I know if I were in his position, I wouldn't go on as long as he has. Sorry for the depressing post, I know this is a slow subreddit, but I'm sure you all know what I'm going through.

q4ee0	-54697	1330110001	diabetes	T1 noon exercise	Hey Reddibetics!90%+ of the time I have a pretty regular schedule, which consists of me doing some kind of exercise for 30-40 minutes everyday at noon.  I'll check my numbers before I go to the gym, and respond accordingly (if it's low--&gt;eat).  Then I usually eat my lunch when I get back to the office after the gym.My question is, do you guys think it would be better for me to eat my lunch prior going to the gym, or after like I have been doing?  I'm getting decent numbers in the afternoon, but I usually have to eat something about 4ish because of the drop in BG.  I'm trying to lose about 5-10 lbs., so I want to maximize my fat burn, but I'm afraid that if I eat before the gym, that my Novolog is going to peak during the middle of my workout and sink my BG.  Anyone else have similar experience or advice?  Thanks!!

u1359	-54697	1337785952	diabetes	Help getting others to understand.	Hey guys,I haven't been on the subreddit in awhile, as I'm trying to figure things out for myself, but I am in a good enough spot, and I am experiencing some social issues surrounding T1.  I'm pretty close with 2 of my co-workers so they know the ins-and-outs of my condition (to a degree), and for the most part, they are emphatic to my cause.  That being said, I've got gastroparesis, so food gets processed at extremely unpredictable times, especially high fat meals, but they always want me to go to lunch with them at really fattening places.  I did for awhile just cause I wanted to fit in, but it made me very ill (I would go low from the insulin after eating, then skyrocket when the food finally gets processed), so I eat very predictable meals all the time.  I try to explain this to them, but I'm getting the impression that they think I'm just a stick-in-the-mud and blame everything on diabetes.  They understand it to a degree, but they don't have to live with it and actually experience it, so it's hard for them and me to see eye-to-eye on it.  Has anyone had any issues with trying to fit in, but still be healthy?  I used to not care about my health, but I'm trying.
ucnf0	-54697	1338409892	Pets	Depression in dogs?	Hey guys,I've got a sweet 3 year old lab/hound mix.  She is a great dog, but she seems really depressed ever since I brought her back from my parent's house (they watched her for a month and a half while I was gone).  All she ever does is sleep on the couch, or just sit there with her eyes open.  She doesn't want to play or do anything.  She'll still eat and gets excited to go outside, but I feel bad for her as she just sits on the couch all day.She is the only dog/pet I have, so I'm thinking that maybe she is lonely?  I work, and while she was at my parent's house, they have other dogs and someone there around the clock.  I've had her since she was 4 weeks old, and my folks are willing to take her in, but I don't want to give her up.  If she is happier there though, I will as I can't take on another dog at the time.Is depression in dogs real?  How do they act?  Thanks everyone.
uegk7	-54697	1338497139	jobs	Declined job offer, but reconsidered and want it.  Help?	Ok, so I was offered a job that I was on the fence about.  I thought about it for awhile, and was unable to accept due to some family issues (my father is terminally ill and my mother is his primary caretaker, but lost her job as a result of tending to him).  Well, everything was so uncertain earlier in the week when they offered it, I had to decline (the job is across the country from my parents).  However, my brother has agreed to move back to my parent's house so that my mom can work part-time and acquire benefits (health insurance).  Had I known that earlier in the week, I would have accepted, but I just couldn't pull the trigger on it at the time.  Is it too late to contact the hiring manager, and if so, would they forever view me as indecisive or flaky on all issues?  She sorta knows the situation of why I declined, so would they be reluctant to offer it again since they may think I will be away/not giving 100%?  I know it can't hurt to try, so I am, but I just don't know if anyone has ever been successfully offered a position again after declining it, or am I just hosed?  Thanks guys.
uy1ia	-54697	1339514692	diabetes	Been on pump for a month and change.  Considering going back...	Like the title says, I've been using a pump for about a month or so now.  It has been ok, but I took it off last week because I finally had a date with a girl and I didn't want her knowing I was T1 right from Day 1.  Well, there isn't going to be a Day 2 with her, so it is ok for me to go back on it.However, I'm finding that I kinda like MDI better again.  I feel like I didn't give the pump a fair shake as I only wore it for a month or so now, but I hate feeling so fragile all the time.  Example, I went out with some friends a few weeks ago with my friend drove.  We went about 45 minutes away to a restaurant/bar, and the whole time I just couldn't get over the fact that I had no car, no safety if my site ripped out on a door/mechanical failure/etc.  My only option would have been to ask him to take me home immediately (they don't really understand T1 as it is) and I'm pretty new and self-conscious so it's difficult for me to bring it up.   I guess I could carry Novo pens with me, but I'm male, so I don't have a purse and I hate things in my pockets as it is.  Plus, that kinda defeats the purpose of it all (if I'm gonna be carrying pens around all the time again, I should just go back to MDI and only have one thing carrying).Besides the complete lack of freedom you have on the pump, it seems like mistakes in carb counting are punished far worse than on MDI.  My bg would go through the roof if I guessed wrong (according to the pump calculations) and would take hours to get back down to normal after it.I'm going to give it another go this week, as I do like the fact that it really helped prevent a number of lows, and I didn't have to eat if I didn't want to (which is great), but I'm just having a really hard time adjusting/accepting it for what it is. :/
vqoi3	-54697	1340892574	diabetes	/r/diabetes.  What do you look like?	Ok, so I've been thinking about this for a little while now, but I figured I'd go ahead and see.  I've been T1 for 14 years now, and in my 14 years of being diabetic, I've never come across another diabetic in real life, much less talked to one.  I'm sure they look like normal people, but it's hard to visualize since I've always been the only person I've ever known that has it.  It can be an isolating feeling (as you all know), but I get jealous of people who know other diabetics, or at least have seen another one, so I figured I'd try the next best thing.So, out of curiosity, what do you look like?  I know that's a kinda scary question, and it's ok if no one wants to show their face, but I figured it would add a much needed personal touch to coping with diabetes.  T1 and T2s welcomed!Here's me at work: [Me](http://imgur.com/s64Pb)EDIT:  Wow!  I never expected this many people to "show" up.  It's been great looking at everyone.  Everyone looks so regular (in a good way, as I've never really felt "regular" because of it).  One day we'll have our /r/diabetes meetup and it will be glorious.  Upvotes for all!

Anyone who has had one care to elaborate?  What is it like?  Do you just snap out of it after a few minutes?  I guess I'm just sorta curious as to what it's like, as it scares me pretty bad.  I'm also scared of the legal ramifications of having one (losing my license).  I hope I'll never know, and I hope the most of you never know too, but it is a part of our lives that may happen (with any luck it won't though).  Thanks guys.

12fs55	-54697	1351738239	diabetes	Dealing with food shame...	We all know the common annoyances in dealing with the general population regarding their knowledge of diabetes; can't eat sugar, can cure it through diet/exercise, etc. I try and put up with it as politely and casually as possible, but I've developed one particular problem over the past few months.We all hate the food police, but its gotten to a point for me where I go through great lengths to eat in private...especially at work. I feel like everyone I I is is judging me and my lifestyle based on how I'm eating and what I'm eating.  Now I'm sorta ashamed to eat in front of people. I've adjusted my lunch time an hour later to avoid everyone in the kitchen at work so I don't have to hear comments regarding MY health. I know they mean well, but I'm embarrassed to eat with my peers now too after a few public comments that kinda got to me more than it should have. I know I just need to just toughen up and not let it get to me, but it still makes me feel guilty for eating (even if it is 'healthy') with workers and/or friends. Has anyone else had this issue?

17mns1	-54697	1359641779	diabetes	Non-diabetic friends and social drinking.	So, I'm in my mid (okay...late) 20s, and I guess you could say I'm still living the "college lifestyle" in some regards.  I work full-time and carry responsibility well, but all my friends are also still in that mentality.  Essentially, my relationships with all of my friends revolves around drinking.  In my more formidable years, I was able to drink 4-5 nights a week and be fine, but I've reduced it to 1 night a week at most right now, but that is still proving to be too much for me.  I'm getting some moderate amounts of neuropathy in my hands/arms as well as my legs, and I've heard that any alcohol consumption can increase that.  Also, I am about to go on Lyrica or Cymbalta for nerve relief.  I've taken Cymbalta before and it pretty much made it impossible for me to drink as I would become violently ill after a couple rounds, which drove me to stop taking it the first time around.  I heard that lyrica is the same in that regards.  My a1C was 5.8 last time, so I've been taking care of myself, but I feel as though this is a natural progression from here on out.The past week or so, I've gone out with my friends (to a bar of course) and I was just drinking water the past two times.  It's kinda miserable, especially with all the pressure (not intentional or by design) that is put on me to drink and have a good time with them.  They don't really get it, and I don't expect them to do so, but going out to a bar and sitting there isn't as fun as it sounds, especially when everyone I know is having fun with it all.I'm getting to a point where I feel it is in my best interest to NOT go out with them to combat the temptation to drink at all, but if I stop going out to bars with them, I know I will certainty lose their friendship.  Not from all of them intentionally kicking me out, but a natural course since I don't participate in the activities that 100% of my friends engage in every weekend.  They are my only friends, so it's a big concern of mine, but I really want to concentrate on my physical health, but this will negatively affect my quality of life I know.  Another reason I want to stop socially drinking is the past 3 times I've drank, I've had extreme lows the next morning (low 30s-40s) even after I eat before going to sleep.  It's really scaring me since I don't want to pass out since I live alone.  I don't want to grow apart from my friends, but the center of our relationship is drinking.  I can't seem to find the balance between good physical health and social/mental health.  Every time I concentrate fully on health, I don't have any friends, and every time I have friends my physical health takes a nosedive.  I'm getting older, so I can't get away with as much as I used to in my younger days.  Has anyone else had issues like this?  It's pretty upsetting...
18yd9k	-54697	1361456566	diabetes	Repeated protein leak in urine.  Scared!	I had an endocrinologist appointment last week and my urine came back with more protein in it than before.  I've been having protein leaks in my urine for a year now, but they said it was higher this time and I'm pretty nervous about my kidney function.  I've got a follow up in 6 weeks, so I'll discuss my options with my endo. then but I'm pretty scared about what's going to happen.  I know better control always helps, and my a1C was 5.3 last week and hasn't been over 6 in over a year and a half now, so I'm doing pretty well in terms of glucose control  That being said, I abused my body for my entire life and only started caring about it within the past two years after ignoring my diabetes for so long.Has anyone else had any kidney issues or problems like that?  Or, any tips for better kidney function?  I drink lots of water and try to avoid excessive protein intake, but do you guys know any other tips that help promote healthy kidneys?  I'm pretty nervous...
1fo4oy	-54697	1370373420	diabetes	Asking potential employers about health insurance	So, I'm looking for a new job and probably about to do the interview circuit thing again (ugh!).  As it is to all of us in America, health insurance is a big factor with employment.  Does anyone know a good time to bring it up when interviewing/after accepting offer?  I REALLY don't want to let on that I'm diabetic before I walk in the door, and they will think something is fishy if I'm deeply inquiring about the prescription plans, deductibles, 'specialist' visits, etc.  I don't want them to know I'm diabetic, but I don't want them to think I'm severely ill and will be missing a lot of work before I even start too though.I've always found this harder than the whole salary thing.  Anyone have any suggestions?  Thanks!

1ja318	-54697	1375110812	diabetes	Vision issues	Hey,So I went to my opthamologist not long ago and he took pictures, dilation, etc. of my eyes and said everything looked fine.  I can only go visit once a year (for insurance reasons), but I repeatedly told him that I'm having very distinct floaters/tears in my vision (especially with left-to-right eye movement), as well as a blurry looking floater (the other ones are black).  All lights seem to have a large tail and halo around them, especially at night too.  He just brushed it off as nothing (he was pretty useless) and said that the pictures came back fine.  They have since gotten worse as I notice them all the time (especially when it's bright outside), and I don't know what I can do.  My a1c was 5.2 a couple weeks ago, so I'm trying to maintain tight control, but they seem to just keep getting worse and worse.  Has anyone else had issues with tears in vision?  Is there some kind of surgical procedure to reduce the tears?  I've tried researching everything I can on the internet, but I can't find anything really substantial.  The floaters/tears used to just be annoying, but now they are sorta impacting the rest of my life.  Inverted colors on all computer screens is a must for me now, and I'm getting pretty scared.  I know I don't contribute as much as I should on this sub, but I really appreciate the advice that I'm always given.  Thanks!

1r239h	-54697	1384955102	diabetes	Not sure if I have a cataract or not.	So, I've been having more floaters the older I get, but they are usually black tears in vision.  However, I've noticed a clear fuzzy one that is in my left eye.  It "moves" with the floaters, but it looks like someone smeared a tiny glob of Vaseline in my vision.  I get halos around vision and poor night vision, but I don't know if that is a cataract or not.  I thought that cataracts changed your whole vision and were acutely located like floaters.Has anyone else had a cataract before?  I've looked at the images and my eyes do not have the overall cloudiness I've seen from google images, but I dunno.  If anyone's had them, can you give me some advice?  I'm not too optimistic right now :/
1t6gee	-54697	1387386831	diabetes	Difficult time in winter months with diet	Every year seems to be about the same for me.  Around October I am unable to keep my diet in check.  I have no self-control over my intake and (while greatly embarrassed by it) eat everything in sight.  It seems to last until late January or so, and it's greatly affecting my glucose control.  I'll sometimes eat until I vomit (gross).  It's generally extremely high carb foods (chocolates, candies, Combos, etc.).Does anyone else have diet issues in the winter?  It seems like there is some kind of biological basis that my brain is telling me that I need to eat more and more to stock up for the winter, but it's ridiculous the amount I consume for months on end!

27dqij	-54697	1401976010	diabetes	Dead Dexcom G4 transmitter immediately after warranty expires.	So, I've been using the Dexcom G4 since last (mid) May.  It's been working great up until last week.  Edgepark (the distributer) called me a few weeks back about a replacement receiver/transmitter since it was out of warranty, and like clockwork, the receiver is displaying "low transmitter battery" and will NOT transfer any data to my device.  This is most likely due to a dead transmitter.  I find it a little TOO coincidental that the device dies completely as soon as it goes out of warranty.  As if it were engineered to die at the 1 year mark, regardless of any other issues.  My insurance pays 100% for the device/transmitters/sensors, but I know I'm lucky to have that, and that it isn't the case for everyone.  It's really frustrating to know that it is designed to die immediately after the warranty expires.  Any one else have this issue?

As i started learning some of the characters such as ki, it makes you write the characters out to learn them and get better at the actual shape. My question is i notice that a lot of Japanese characters have crooked corners at the end of lines if that makes any sense lol I see some places use just straight lines and others use the normal characters. I'm wondering if it is necessary to perfect these corners or if i can just ignore them until possibly the future. I have terrible handwriting in English so i am having a bit of a hard time writing some of this kana with the corners.Thanks for your help!

I was looking for a way to make it besides with a bamboo whisk and what i do is put a little hot water in a cup, put the matcha then whisk it with an electric whisk for 30 second - 1minute then poor the rest of the hot water and wala, tea is ready! Now the problem i am having is that when i get to the bottom of the tea i have like sand like matcha that sticks around at the bottom. Is this normal and you're supposed to drink it or am i doing something wrong. Any help is much appreciated! Also in a few days i will be ordering my first kettle and teapot with an infuser. I have never brewed tea before and would like to brew only loose leaf tea, no tea bags, etc. Any good suggestions of a good loose leaf green tea to start with?

The questions i have are #1 when i brew the tea there is small little pieces that make it through my infuser and into my cups of tea when i poor. Is this normal and you just drink it or does this mean i need to get a better infuser? Also i have a question about reusing the tea i already brewed. So from my knowledge i can use the same sencha for up to two times total and genmaicha up to three times. Now my question is how do you store the tea and how long is it good for. I just leave the tea in the infuser basket after my brew and put it back in the teapot and store it like that until my next use. How long does the tea stay usable? A day, two, etc. Also does anyone know the exact proportions for tea to water ratio. I currently am doing one teaspoon and 6 oz of water per cup. I usually want two cups per brew so i use two teaspoons and 12 oz of water, is this correct?  Thanks so much for the help guys :) Keep on brewing :P

3czm3s	-54698	1436679759	piano	Beginner with a question.	So i am learning piano ( very new to it ) and i have a random question. I am in lessons and learning how to read but also want to start practicing my actual piano skills in the meantime. I found a song that i want to learn that doesn't seem too difficult. The problem is it seems most songs i look at have many different versions. Why is this? Is there not just a set and stone version of every song? For example i want to learn this song but there is two different version that are quite a bit different or it seems that way to me. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGACI-xSoUand https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxNg3rxyH-ISomeone care to shine some light on this for me i would much appreciate it. Thank you very much!

My concern is that i am trying to stay as low level as possible to not get pked and my range level is 1 so it might not be possible for me. Thanks!  
3dcgg1	-54698	1436935166	2007scape	Is black chinning even worth it?	I am on my ironman and i recently got 73 hunter. My plan was to get to 99 through black chins. I thought that being a level 35 i wouldn't encounter many pkers and the ones i did encounter couldn't really kill me. Boy was i wrong. I have been attacked within 5-10 minutes every single time i get out there it is literally impossible to hunt black chins no matter what time of day i try to hunt them. Is hunting red chins my only other viable option and is it much worse exp then black chins? At this point it seems like i don't have another choice. Thanks!
3dv7y0	-54698	1437336806	bicycling	Beginner with a few questions!	Hello! I am new to biking and am needing some help. I am looking for a mountain bike to get around in college instead of a car. I also want to use the bike for trails and exercise as well. The thing is there is so many different kinds at different prices im lost. I found a trek 6500 that is around 2005 (before they made the logo into the shield) it is really nice and feels great. It is selling used for about $369 dollars. Is this a good deal and something that would fit my needs well? It is an older bike so would a brand new trek with less stuff be a better option? They are around the same price but obviously the new treks don't have a lot of features that the older one does since it sold new for around $1k. Thanks for all the help and am looking forward to talking with you guys!

3fzgvg	-54698	1438852622	bicycling	Good bike for a beginner for college?	Hello. I am looking for a good bike to last me through college in a semi rural area. Looking for a mountain bike because of the area and i will also take it on trails and maybe parks occasionally. The only bike i have been looking at is the diamondback overdrive 29er because i got a nice coupon for it. Any opinions on this bike (2015 edition) or any recommendations for bikes for someone of my needs. Max i am willing to spend would be about 500-600 but lower is obviously better. Thanks for all the help :)
3g2ih1	-54698	1438905461	bicycling	Good college bicycle?	I have been doing a lot of research regarding a good bike to get around college and also a bike i can take to parks and ride the trails (concrete) for exercise. People have told me that a hybrid bike would be the best for what i am wanting, is this true or would a street bike be better? Also i will be keeping my bicycle in my apartment so i am not worried about theft so i am looking for advise about good bikes under $500. So far i have found these that i am interested in. Treck 7.1 fx    Schwinn phocus 1600 700c drop bar road bicycle Schwinn 3.0 700c hybrid bicycle Any experiences on any of these bikes? pros and cons? etc. Also any recommendations for what i need and advise is much appreciated and wanted.

w0xo2	-54724	1341395542	insomnia	delayed sleep phase syndrome.	I finally got myself to a sleeping specialist, and after an overnight study, turns out i have [delayed sleep phase syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_disorder). I never have that issue that i see so many insomniacs have where they feel tired but just can't sleep. For me it's that, my body feels and acts in the day as a so called "normal" persons would at night. Sometimes I have days where I don't even feel hungry until night either and i won't eat all day. I don't feel awake and ready for the day until around 5pm, i then stay up all night without feeling tired, and go to bed at 6am. This was a big issue of course with school until I graduated because by the time I was getting tired, it would be time to get ready for school so i missed sleep many nights. Another issue was that since I was never hungry in the day but wanted to eat at night, a lot of times i couldn't because everyone else sleeps and it'd be too loud so i also lost a lot of weight. Things have gotten better now with graduation and the option of night classes in college, but really the only advice my doctor could give for DSPS is that if it works for you, just let your body run it's course because it causes much physical stress to try and force your body to do something that is not normal for that individual. Are there any similar people in here?EDIT: i'm not quite sure what i'd say to TLDR this, but we're already all awake and have the time to read anyways..

My band mate has this other version of the same song without those parts that sound the same, however, as far as i know that seeming plagiarism is still coincidental.

I've recently had quite the distant guitarist...my only other member who comes in and out. I myself am not that great at guitar... If anyone is interested in helping out, i don't need anything specific just some tracks to work with that i could add vocals to, edit, and produce to help further my abilities in getting us out there as an experimental group until possibly i find my own path. I will give any credit for your work that you would like, as far as listing you as an official member even. Please comment or message me to let me know, any help is appreciated.

ymnrf	-54724	1345624937	atheism	Atheism on kosher products?	Now I hope this isn't too touchy of a subject if someone may view it as Anti-semitic, I can assure you it is not at all, I am just simply against all churches as a whole, but here is what I have to say: Every now and then I find myself buying kosher products. Things like the kosher hotdogs because for some reason, i think they taste better, even if all that kosher means, is to be blessed by a Rabbi supposedly. However, i do not know if the money gathered from selling kosher products goes to support the Jewish church. Supporting churches of ANY kind is something i do not want to do. I know in some ways this can seem radical, and nearly impossible with how many major corporations are ran by different church organizations, but i'll do what i can to not support those groups. Mostly I would just like to get more opinions on this, any feedback would be nice. thanks!EDIT: tl;dr Do kosher products go to support jewish churches? Do you consciously try at all to not support church groups in the marketing industry? EDIT 2: The only other info i've found so far is that making kosher products is way more [strict](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosher_foods) than i thought before.

I don't think this is worth making a throwaway account over but i'm sure i'll get hated for some of it, anyways, here i go: I am above all a black metalist more than any other genre, but i dont really like Mayhems deathcrush album. Cannibal corpse doesn't amuse me that much and there are far more, much better death metal bands, even from that time period when they started so i don't get why THEY got all the fame they did. Most Behemoth is shit to me. I feel absolutely no need to respect the well known classics just because they are, well, well known classics, i like the classic metal I do, but a lot of the more recognized ones i don't care for all that much.Thats that, i feel relieved. Please share yours.EDIT: formatting sucks, whatever, it's 4am.EDIT 2: I feel myself about to be thrown into metal hell. I really just wanna hear other peoples confessions though haha.

As a former Misanthropist, one of my main points for maintaining the general dislike of the human species is because of the very human stereotype of "killing what we cannot understand." With the aid of historical research I came to realize this stereotypes origins,  tracing it back to the dark ages spread of religion and religious slaughter of foreign cultures. I can say now i've found some faith in humanities scientific advancements and the good ones out there looking to better humanity, but all the more reason to be against the religious plague.

I just came up with a theory about the Civilisation games, geek that I am.An advanced alien race, hoping to fully understand humanity (either before invasion, first contact, or allegiance), has cloned some of the greatest leaders we've ever had, placing them with a cloned or synthetic populace in basic cities on a terraformed alien world. The cloned leaders are artificially matured and inured with personality, and they are gifted with immortality, capable of living for millennia. The planet is contained within a time dilation field so that the aliens can watch thousands of years pass in a relatively short amount if time. The field technology is rigged so that the earlier, duller centuries pass by in a flash, whereas the later years and moths, towards the very end of the experiment, pass at a far, far, slower rate (though still they pass very much faster than standard).The aliens watch over the planet as their experiment progresses, waiting not for a victor or a champion, but simply compiling data.

I posted this as a comment in answer to a question on [r/askreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/) earlier today ([What movie is your favorite and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1tbfd0/what_movie_is_your_favorite_and_why_dont_spoil/)), and I thought I'd share it here. I've edited it slightly.Sergio Leone's masterworks *Once Upon a Time in the West* and *The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly:* everything about these films is either perfect or brilliant. The cinematography of each pairs with the music, the plot and the landscape to create a entirely cohesive and beautiful piece of art. The acting is superb, too - Eli Wallach's performance in TGTBTU is one of the most unique I've ever seen, and of course Clint Eastwood's third stint as The Man With No Name (AKA Joe, Manco, &amp; Blondie) is his best realisation of the character that made him (and his poncho) an icon. In *West*, Henry Fonda plays against type as a scumbag so brutal and unlike the majority of his roles, and Jason Robards' Cheyenne is the quintessential gold-hearted bandit. Charles Bronson as Harmonica does a perfectly fine job of filling the "nameless gunman" role that Eastwood turned down, bringing to it a pained element that the OG Man With No Name never quite had (though I really wish Eastwood had had another outing of the character, one of my favourites in cinema).The scale of each is amazing. From the slightly-sprawling-yet-cohesive plot of TGTBTU to the stunning vistas (filmed in Monument Valley, Utah) of *West*, the size of the settings of each film is humbling, though each maintains hold on very personal stories.Finally, the man himself, the genius that is Enio Morricone. His ST work is among the best I've heard, with the main theme of TGTBTU entering pop culture to such a degree that most people could probably complete the opening bars ("aa-a-aa-a-aaa" "wah wah wah") even if they've never heard of the film. *Ecstasy of Gold* from TGTBTU is one of my all-time favourite pieces of music, as is *Man With Harmonica* (Bronson's character's semi-diegetic theme) from *West*. The strength of Morricone's work is twofold: firstly, you notice it when you need to. A lot of the time, it's unobtrusive, subtle scene-and-tone setting bakground music. Other times, however, it cuts right to the fore, and contends with the actual on-screen action for your attention - but it always does this perfectly, with no scene feeling lacking in or crowded by music. Secondly, he makes the music seem like it's originating from what you’re seeing onscreen. Sometimes this is through use of diegetic sound - a prison band playing a song in TGTBTU, or Harmonica earning his name in *West*. Mostly, though, it feels like the music is bleeding from the iconic western landscapes against which the film is set, or that the characters themselves, through action or personality, are carrying the music with them (e.g., Eastwood does something badass accompanied by a musical sting, and it feels like his action brought that music into being). Guys. I really flippin’ love Enio Morricone, you guys.Anyway, I deeply, *deeply* love these films. I could go on longer as to why I love them (the Western mythology, the grey morality, the supporting actors... &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.) but this’ll do for now.PS: The ten-minute opening scene of *West*. Holy shit, what a bloody triumph of cinema.NINJAEDIT: formatting

22b46n	-54760	1396742623	KerbalSpaceProgram	Can anybody help with a decaying orbit problem?	I'm pretty early on in career mode, and have launched a few craft into orbit (as well as landed an unmanned vehicle on Mun and made a pass of Minmus). One of my rockets is currently orbiting Kerbin with no remaining fuel, and I just noticed that the orbit is actually decaying - every orbit, the apoapsis drops by ~1km and the periapsis by ~200m. To recover my craft, I just need to keep orbiting, right? Unfortunately, as the apoapsis is &gt;240,000m and the periapsis is &gt;70,000m, I can't use full time warp, and am limited to 4x for a portion of the orbit. It's slow going! And when I view the rocket from the space centre or another craft, the orbit is stable.Does anyone know of a way to bypass the time warp restrictions, or another way I might speed up the decay?Thanks!
2adjqk	-54760	1405033521	Christianity	I'm putting it all out there with a girl, which may end up with me breaking off our friendship. Prayer would be appreciated.	I've known this girl for about three years. We've come close to dating once or twice, but she's always pulled away. I thought I got over her a number of times, and have even been out with and asked out other girls in those periods where I wasn't interested in her, but inevitably I'll fall for her again and once again be met with the pain of not being able to be more than friends. She recently got back into town for the Summer, and our friendship has made me miserable - because it isn't enough. It seems that whenever I'm talking to her regularly these feelings grow, I can't manage to stop them, and the rejection or expectation of it hurts so much.So, this Sunday when I see her, I will be laying it all down in front of her (as gracefully as possible). If she responds positively, awesome. We'll try that side of things. If she's not interested, then I'll have to ask that we no longer be friends. Which will suck, but if I can't stop falling for her, then this is the only route left for me. Where I'm at now is unhealthy.If you guys could pray for a positive outcome, that would be great. Pray for what you feel comfortable praying for - that it will go as I hope, or that it will be blessed whatever the outcome, that Holy Spirit will be with me as I talk and with me if I need comforting... et cetera. You believers are powerful people, and I have faith in the effectiveness of your prayer.Thanks, all :)(PS: If I seem dramatic: yeah, I'm a poet and a performer. My personality, I'm afraid.PPS: if you wanna advise - I feel confident in my decision, but please, go ahead.)
2aumjw	-54760	1405510752	Scotch	Birthday's coming up. Looking for a new Scotch...	I've looked at the recommendation links in the sidebar, and the whisky map, but human input is always nice :)I'm lightly experienced in whisky (meaning I've been through and left far behind the Grouse, the Bell's, the Johnnie Walker Red...). I've previously very much enjoyed bottles of Glenmorangie Lasanta, Oban 14, Aberlour A'bunadh (43) and most recently GlenDronach 15 Revival (which is awesome). I found Ardbeg 10 pretty dull (too smooth!) and just didn't like Dura Superstition. Having said that about Ardbeg, I did enjoy a dram of Uigeadail I had in a whisky bar last year.It'd be amazing if you wonderful folk of Scotchit could give me a recommendation based on this brief history. Price range probably goes up to about 50-something pounds ($90, I guess?).Thanks!

2lj1kq	-54760	1415318782	AskHistorians	How much did life change for peasants over the 1800 years between the expansion of the Roman Empire and the Industrial Revolution?	Say you gave a documentary team a time machine. Starting from the start of the first millennium, they visit a village in, say, the south of modern Germany once every hundred years, filming an hour-long film at each stop amounting to an 18-episode documentary series. Would big differences be noticeable every episode? Which episodes would bring the biggest changes? The village would remain a village for the whole series, so "the village is now a city" would be inapplicable.Thanks!(If you're feeling generous, a breakdown of each of the 18 stops would be amazing!)

xqrzz	-54801	1344220515	Libertarian	Liberal wanting to talk to Libertarians	I am looking to talk directly to some libertarians. I was going to post this on PoliticalDiscussion but felt this sub would be better to talk to libertarians. I've read numerous threads on here, reading over how libertarians think but I wanted to engage in a discussion with libertarians myself.I'm liberal and have a tendency to lean to the left. I'm very strongly for gay marriage, the legalization of marijuana, pro-choice, gun control and equal rights (in regards to one's sexuality, ethnicity or gender.) And I am anti-war. And for internet privacy and general privacy and all that jazz.I live in Australia where we have both private health care and government run health care. I know libertarians are strongly opposed to public health care but I feel this works well. I spoke to a friend who proclaimed to be a libertarian (she's a lot more of a right wing conservative) and she insisted that I was allowing the government to control my life and I had absolutely no personal freedom. That seemed a little extreme to me. I used to be strongly opposed to capitalism but I understand and accept it now. It works for our society. At the same token, I do not condone full-blown socialism. I like the ideologies behind it but don't believe it could effectively exist. For similar reasons, I cannot ever see true libertarianism ever working. With my understanding, libertarians don't want anything government mandated. In theory, I too like the sound of this but I fail to understand how it would efficiently work in society. Again with capitalism, I do appreciate the idea of people having to work in order to get what they want. Yet I feel it is a government's duty to give people access to universal health care, and that is socialized but I don't see that as a terrible thing. The reason I object to socialism is due to a hypothetical prac I read a teacher conducted with their class, where they set up a socialist classroom, in which everyone's grades were equal and the class averaged a B but then everyone started slacking off and failed eventually. In a nutshell, I see that socialism could promote inefficiency and laziness. But, to me, that doesn't have a lot to do with universal health care.I apologize for the wall of words. I value a lot of what libertarianism advocates - people having freedom. Liberty is important but not at the cost of societal stability and order. I personally feel there needs to be some structure and regulation.I am open to hearing/reading any insight libertarian has to offer. I really enjoy discussing political matters and further educating myself. The only set beliefs I have are the ones I stated above (gay marriage, marijuana legalization, anti-war, etc) so I like to think I am open minded to anything you have to say regarding government structure, economics, etc. I'd really just like you to share me your opinions and express my own with you to have a mature discussion. My friend who is apparently libertarian refused to talk to me about these things because "it's not what friends should talk about" so I just want to engage in a lively debate with strangers on the internet!Also, some other questions (because I really needed to add more to this post):- Why do free markets work?- What's the deal with Austrian economics?TL;DR I'm an annoying liberal who wants to talk to libertariansEDIT: Thanks for the response! I am still going to respond to a lot of people I haven't answered yet because I am really enjoying talking to everyone. Most comments have been really insightful and helped me understand libertarian ideology a lot better, so I really appreciate this. EDIT 2: There's an overwhelming amount of messages I have gotten and I have tried reading through them all. I hope to get some time to respond to a few more. Overall, I really want to thank everyone for being so helpful in briefing me more on libertarian views. I have a lot of youtube clips to watch and books to read until I am completely knowledgeable (advised to check out by a lot of you) but I am really content with all this. I am still not really convinced about guns - I know it has been explained to me really well but it's something I definitely have to search more in depth on my own. Thanks so much for everything.

I'd really love to interview someone who is Buddhist, so if you'd be willing to help, comment here and I will PM you. I'd like someone who is a dedicated Buddhist and also willing to tell me their name so I can properly quote them.

In the last two episodes, I personally feel her character has been incredible and has brought me to the brink of tears, especially in the scene where she threw up all that blood. Yet I have been confronted by people who say she's the damsel in distress still and they absolutely hate every scene with her. I find this odd because she's becoming my favourite aspect of the show.So, how do you feel about Elena Gilbert and her transition and why?

Well, for one, Caroline doesn't need him or any man to show her the world, she's very capable of doing that herself. And I cannot get past the fact he is a sadistic serial killer who doesn't even care for his sister. I like them as a crackship but I cannot fathom the idea of them being canon.

He violated her and it'd be great character development for her to get revenge on the man who assaulted her, rather than have Glenn fight her battles. The writing in the show has done a fairly good job at making a fair amount of the audience hate/dislike the main female characters - Lori, Andrea and even Michonne - and adore the male leads. So, instead of having a man save the day, shouldn't Maggie be capable of taking down The Governor? Since she came onto the show, she's become a lot tougher and it'd further her character development.

I still enjoy it for the most part despite recognising a lot of these issues, but it can be overwhelming having exchanges with people online who fawn over the character Klaus yet demonise all the women. There's also a lot of people who glaze over the show's representation of PoC and how every main character is cisgendered.There is so much more I could go into but I'll just leave talking points for people to respond to (if anyone is interested):- What's your opinion of Elena?- How do you feel about the writing of the female characters over the male characters?- Consent.

He then told me that when he would be close to ejaculation that he would sneak out of the stall if no one else was in the restroom and open one of the soap dispensers. He would then continue to ejaculate into the soap dispenser. This happened 3 times at least. I have never again used soap dispensers to this day.

24pq6l	-54806	1399231927	explainlikeimfive	ELI5: Why do so many non-American singers sound completely American when they sing?	I've always noticed that many singers from many different countries tend to have a seemingly American accent when they sing.I really started to think about this when Lorde started blowing up. She's from New Zealand and watching a few interviews it's obvious that she has a normal New Zealand accent. However if you listen to her music you'd never guess she wasn't from the United States. Several of her songs even have parts that are closer to talking than singing, but she sounds absolutely American. Conversely, when I listen to Artists like Lily Allen, Arctic Monkeys, the Wombats etc. they have a very obvious English accent.So what's the deal? Are these artists just trying to market themselves better to American listeners? Is it because most chart topping music comes from the US and these artists just learned to sing listening to American music?

2iurvo	-54806	1412948391	NoStupidQuestions	Why do I see more trikes (3 wheeled motorcycles) than ever when 3-wheelers were discontinued due to being unsafe?	For anyone unfamiliar, a trike is a three wheeled motorcyle in [this type of configuration](http://www.santiagochopper.com/media/trike_conversions/Blue_Roadking_Trike_Body/New-Roadking-trike-body-kit6.jpg), not to be confused with a Spyder. [3-wheelers](http://demos.appthemes.com/classipress/files/2012/06/688418-500x375.jpg) were basically a modern day 4-wheeler, but with one wheel up front. They were manufactured until the mid 80's when the companies voluntarily quit making them because the 3-wheelers had a tendency to tip over when turning and braking at the same time or just turning too quickly. So it makes me wonder why trikes are becoming so much more popular. I understand they they are probably more comfortable to ride, but if you ever had to do some serious evasive maneuvers to not hit something I feel it would just roll right over. Plus they can't lean into the turns, which I think wouldn't make for the most comfortable cycling experience and that higher center of gravity would hurt safety and handling.  So I guess I just don't get trikes.

Assuming the outbreak began this year, I took the world population (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population 7.166 Billion) and divided it by 5000, meaning 5000 zombies for 1 human. The results were shocking. 7.166 billion / 5000 = 1433200 (one million four hundred thirty-three thousand two hundred) humans left on the ENTIRE PLANET.Moral of the story? If you're alone, don't kill someone, because they may be the last human you will ever see.
27x6qg	-54834	1402530833	civ	A Civ short story	Many years ago, my people spread throughout the land, dominating our continent and prospering. We ruled supreme, bringing peace, equality and justice for all. Life was great. Now it is but a memory, all but forgotten.A few centuries ago, a few of our less cultured neighbours rose to power, establishing new Civilizations. We kept a watchful eye on them for years, ready to destory them should they challenge our power. For many years after, they started to develop advanced technologies, improving the land around them and growing. When they expanded to a new land and built new cities , we decided that we should finally make contact. We sent our best ambassadors to meet them, taking weapons in order to defend themselves from the hostile neutral land. But when they arrived they were horrified. These new Civilizations had embraced the art of war, recklessly abusing their natural resources and destroying the land. Thats when they realised they had to be destroyed. Once spotted, they were quickly cut down, because many years of peace had left them unprepared for an attack by other humans.When the only survivor returned, barely alive, it was decided that they must be destroyed at all costs. However, they were now too strong and started to rapidly spread across the land, pushing us back, reducing our agricultural lands, causing thousands to die in the process.Now we are stuck in small, unsanitised settlements, broken shadows of our former selves. All seems lost, but we have learned that there are others like us, almost identical, fighting a common cause, ready to strike back. We will reclaim what was once ours. We will make our ancestors proud. We will find a way to fix this.I will not rest until every Civilization in the world is destroyed. We will break out of these 'encampments', and destroy the filthy scum that refer to us as 'barbarians'. THEY are the true villians.

I spent many hours playing it, commanding my armies through the power of music and annihilating my enemies. So I thought of an idea. A modpack containing all tribes from the Patapon franchise. Patapons, Zigotons, Karmen, Bonedeth/Ah Ooh Society. If this were to actually be made, I would s*** myself.Heres an example:------------------------------------(Tribe Name)Leader: (Leader of said Tribe)Unique Units: (could be all unit types from Patapon 1+2 for all tribes)Unique Building / improvement: (look at things each tribe constructed in the games and make what you will of it e.g. Obelisk for Patapons replace Monument and give combat bonus as well as culture. Karmen could have a defensive improvement replacing the fort.Unique Ability: Great Generals are replaced with Hero/Dark Hero units, spawning as a chosen class each time.-------------------------------------------------------------That's my idea. Feedback and other suggestions are welcome.

Unfortunately it only joins together the present and things that have already happened, so no going into the future. Also it requires tremendous amounts of energy to keep you in the past, so you only stay back for a few seconds.Before I could test it, there was a flash and suddenly a man wearing what appeared to be an improvised combination between a biohazard and radioactive suit, a backpack with tin cans of food, a pistol, and a gas mask appeared before me.This shocked me, and before I could run he stepped infront of me, and said two words: "PREPARE NOW" and then disappeared in another flash.I was confused at what I had just saw, but that quickly turned to shock as I realised whoever it was, he had a digital watch bearing a striking resemblance to my time machine, and it's origin date had stated he had arrived from one year from now.

Automatically go to war with every player it meets.UB: (You guys think of it, I don't have BE)UU: (You guys think of it, I don't have BE)Now that we have the civ, let's make the corresponding scenario. Create a map based on this http://abby.graymoose.com/jupgrade/images/Untitled.png with all home players just starting in the future age. Each sponsor can be represented by it's closest civ 5 counterpart e.g. Washington as ARC. The territories unoccupied by a sponsor can be city states. The custom Supremacy Faction will occupy at least 1 CS in Americas, South Pacific and Afro-Eurasia.Does this idea sound good? Bear in mind I only thought of this custom civ for specifically this scenario.

Because when you think about it, we are nothing more than bags of meat, waiting to be caught and killed.The reason for our dominance is because of our carelessness. We are so good at killing other things. We have unwittingly wiped out entire species with little effort many times. If hominids never appeared, then there is no way that any civilization could have ever appeared.If you want a species to rise, you have to wreck a few planets. Consuming resources is how civilizations thrive. Any alien lifeforms that have risen before us inevitably destroy themselves when they realise the error of their ways, because error keeps lifeforms motivated to survive.Fear creates motivation. Motivation creates error. Error is perfection.

The thoughts of protecting the people, banishing evil from our streets, earning medals, and coming home to my family knowing that they were safe and sound. Also there was high pay.Three days later, a protest broke out in the capital. The protesters claimed that they wanted TRUE freedom and prosperity for all. Riot police were protecting the Parliament building brandishing their batons, while using their shields to block incoming rocks and other projectiles.I sat in my chair, far away, in my sniper's nest. I was confused as to why I was needed here, considering how well the riot police were holding off the protesters just fine. But I was told to 'monitor the situation'. With a scope and bullets, apparently.Suddenly I received a call on my radio. A voice that I did not recognise told me to fire on one of the protesters. I refused, but then they told me that I would be fired, my family evicted, and being branded an enemy of the state if I did not obey.Suddenly I lost control of my body. An unseen force made my arm raise the rifle and point it at the head of a protester, which appeared to be none older than 14.I could do nothing, but pull the trigger.

It will increase happiness by 3, but with no production.2. Denouncing a player could increase unhappiness in their empire, in the sense that Denouncing is like an insult, and insults hurt their people's feelings.This would be useful, as it is more realistic, and players that drop into massive unhappiness when they conquer large cities could manage it.Certain techs could increase the effect of option 1, such as 'Radio', and 'Internet', as they make propaganda easier to spread.

Videos on YouTube depicting ridiculous ways to die in many videogames are quite popular. People do it for FUN.What some people don't seem to realise, is that over time, graphical depiction of death and injury have gotten more and more lifelike. Screams of pain, blood splattering everywhere, etcetera.And there is no way to make it permanently stop, because the game would have to shut down permanently for that to happen.This is a perfect example of purgatory, and you, player, are the torturer, having complete control over their actions.Still feel good about your actions?

2pslsn	-54834	1419003136	civ	Mod idea: Atheism appears, damaging your religion	When a player reaches the Industrial Era, a new 'religion', or Anti-religion in this case, appears in their capital, with only 1 follower, and 1 pressure, however, it cannot be destroyed or overtaken by another religion. This is the symbol: http://www.wikisymbol.com/images/com_sobi2/gallery/290/290_image_4.pngAs the player discovers more technologies, the pressure made by atheism in their empire will grow by a small amount each time a new discovery is made, eventually causing it to spread. This simulates increasing numbers of people turning to Atheism as more and more mysteries of nature (such as natural disasters) are solved.Since religion has been  a major cultural thing for every Civilization in history, every Atheist in your empire would reduce culture and faith production by 1 each per follower, until they each are at +1PT. However, since people ignore the worship of religion and decide to spend more time finding answers, each Atheist would increase your Science output by +3PT.Because Atheism will only grow, some social policies and ideology tenets could reduce the growth and spread of Atheism:* An Autocracy and Order/Communist Government would become more hostile to Anti-religious people, and possibly become like a Fundamentalist Government to defend their beliefs.* A Freedom/Democracy could use non-religious tolerance to reduce (but not stop) the harmful effects.I feel that this would be more realistic and add more excitement to the endgame. An more ideas for this to help balance this are welcome in the comments.

2rcqzw	-54834	1420420967	atheism	How is atheism different from any other religion?	Religions serve as guidelines on how to live your life. Millenias ago they were mainly 'answers' for the unexplainable. If anything, religions are ideas, theories, etc. Overall, they are a type of faith.Atheists prefer to distance themselves away from Religion as far as possible. But after pondering it, I have concluded that Religion and Atheism is not so different. This post works under the assumption that you reject all forms of religion.Atheism has existed since the Ancient Greeks, and Buddhism rejects the concept of a Deity, yet it is still called a Religion.*Most* Religions believe in an afterlife. Athiests don't. Notice the ***'most'.***When it comes to indoctrination, Religions go through a certain process, while atheists simply tell people to convert to an atheist lifestyle. **Still indoctrination.**It is because of religion that people live their lives in a certain way. When it comes to atheism, they can live life anyway they want. **But having freedom to do anything is still a way of living.**That's not all. People in a religion have to have 'faith' in what they believe in. It compels them to believe, and this is why the concept of God and an Afterlife exist. **These things cannot be disproven, so faith is strong**. Atheism is mainly a lack of faith, right? Wrong. In order to not believe in God or an Afterlife, you have to have strong faith in those things not existing. For all we know, there is a God, just not the one that we think it is. Each religious interpretation of God is a different iteration, and they may all be wrong, or right.Faith - Complete trust or confidence in somebody or **something.** The **something** being no God or Afterlife.Just a showerthought.For the record, I believe there could be a God that allows both Good and Evil to happen so they are distinguishable, along with Evolution and Reincarnation.

2sbz0u	-54834	1421188357	civ	I thought of a way to implement the Assassin's Creed story into Civ (Mod Request/Idea)	When the game starts, special unique 'Assassin' or 'Templar' units are distributed all over the map, and will wander it, looking to enlighten a Civ of their ideology. These units are civillians, but they are immune to Barbs (presumably because of advanced combat tactics) and must be captured by one of your units.When one is captured, they will tell your people (via text box) about their beliefs in how the world should work, and claim a Civilization came before humanity and created them, granting you some faith and 1 free social policy. You will also be able to build an Assassin or Templar messenger, which can spread their ideas like a missionary.A new currency (gold, faith, culture, etc.) could be introduced, called philosophy, which can be from 0 to 100. You start at 50. By capturing Assassins or Templar units or spreading their ideas, your civilization could move towards 0 (Templar beliefs) or 100 (Assassin beliefs).Ideology would play a major part. Templars will support an Autocracy while Assassin's support Freedom. Order could be Neutral.On very rare occasions, antiquity sites could reveal evidence of a 'Civilization that came before', such as containing a small, but powerful weapon a few eras ahead (E.g. a 10HP musketman while you're in the Classical Era) or a Great Work, made up of amazing and awe-inspiring piece of technology.After finishing AC: Rogue I felt that the Assassin's Creed universe could fit well into Civ with all the manipulation of History, it could provide a great 'side-game' to the main game.Discussion of this and additional ideas in the comments are welcome.

If you don't know, he was a serial killer in the Whitechapel district of London around the 1880s and 1890s, who killed 6 prostitutes and was never caught.Since Victory is in Victorian London (duh), he could appear in-game, as a flashback or main story level.The killings he committed could be due to the fact that he was an Assassin agent who killed several Templar agents, or vice versa. It would also shed light on how he was never caught, as Assassin's and Templars are great at that.

2ws8cd	-54834	1424631393	assassinscreed	Would anyone like an AC game set during the Napoleonic Wars?	I certainly would.I have only played Rogue, so forgive any errors.The background to the game could be that the Assassins want to take advantage of Napoleon's dream of a new French Empire, and influence his life to make him become Emperor. France becomes a massive haven of Assassin activity. The rest of Europe remains as Templar-controlled Monarchies and form Coalitions to unite against the Assassin-controlled aggressor, as now the Assassins plan to attack them and destroy their Monarchies.Later, Assassin-controlled USA wants to rid all of North America of Templar influence and attacks Canada (War of 1812).The story could revolve around 2 protagonists: a French Assassin who assists Napoleon's conquests around Europe, and a British Templar who fights in the Iberian peninsula and North America. Or Shay and Arno could be the characters, they should at least make an appearance.Locations could be Moscow, Paris, the Spanish countryside and the Canada-US border.These ideas may be good or terrible, but how would you feel about any form of a Napoleonic Wars / War of 1812 game?
2wtdf0	-54834	1424650486	civ	Would you prefer Civ 6 to have a tactical battlefield for combat?	Heres the idea:Units can be made into stacks and combined into 'armies'. At the start of the game only 2 units could form into an army, but researching technologies could increase that limit (maybe up to 10?)When 2 opposing armies meet, the units in the stacks separate out onto a small randomnly generated battlefield, then 1UPT comes into play.The armies would fight until one is completely destroyed, or one orders a retreat (forcing the enemy army onto a different tile in the main map)Naval combat would be largely the same except in ocean.The tile being fought on would determine the terrain of the battle e.g. fighting over a jungle tile will make the tactical map have many jungle tiles, a tile on the coast would have a beach and some water at the edge, etc.Amphibious invasions would have half of the map covered by water for embarked units to get out of.Attacking across a river could have the tactical map have shallow, cross-able water tiles in the middle with several bridges if there are roads between the tiles.Attacking a city could actually have buildings on individual hexes for collateral damage.What do you guys think of this?

I had led 3 expeditions inthe Middle East, 1 near Mecca and 2 near Jeruslaem and had located 3 temples. They were so old that some of the artifacts could fall apart from the slightest touch. The odd thing was these mysterious tablets. They were so well perserved. They looked only to be a few decades old. And they all said the same thing "Heed these words and thy shalt be saved". All while located next to a holy book and some scrolls.One in Armaic, one in Hebrew, and the other in Arabic. The first 2 had been only partially intact, with only the first 8 words clear. This one, however, was in better condition. It was much larger and had more words. Would I earn fame and fortune? Would I rewrite history? Would I finally solve the mystery behind the tablets?I translated the words. It read as follows:"Heed these words and thy shalt be saved from my wrath. For if my tombs shall unleash my second coming. The world shall be cleansed of heathens, while the followers shall be granted eternal life in my kingdom."I dismissed this as nonsense, but then I felt tremors in the ground. My team outside was screaming, and I could hear the rumblings of a volcano. I dropped the tablet in horror, smashing like a regular artifact, and wondered whether it was too late to convert.

31sby5	-54834	1428436663	civ	Civ 6 idea to make Governments more dynamic and unique	As well as selecting your Social Policies/Civics, you will have a main Government type that will influence the development of your civilization. Civilizations that share Government types will have friendlier relations.-------------------------------------------------------------------**Tribal:** The basic, plain starting Govt Type. No bonuses or disadvantages.-------------------------------------------------------------------**Democracy:** Every 10/20/30/40 turns, depending on game speed, your civilization will call elections. A popup will appear, prompting you to select a party that you want to rule the nation.The Right Wing Party wants to develop the military and social heirarchy, giving you a bonus to military unit production, and faster research of military techs e.g. Rifling. Military units will recieve a small bonus to strength when fighting on home territory.The Left Wing Party wants to develop the state and offer more freedom. A minor boost will be given to science/gold/building production and increased happiness, at a small cost to military unit production, with more military units decreasing happiness when not at war.When an election is called, your happiness, if high enough, will make your selected party win after a certain number of turns. Low happiness will make no party win. Be careful, as enemy spies can meddle with the results during the election turns.-------------------------------------------------------------------**Federal Republic:** Every city you own except your capital act as a puppeted city-state (like a state) only you can select the category of units to produce. Increased happiness for the amount of freedom, but the large division of your empire can easily result in collapse/breakup.-------------------------------------------------------------------**Communist:** Religion in cities cause unhappiness. Now you can purge religion from your cities with increased production of inquisitors. Increased production for EVERYTHING, but you cannot have more than 500 gold at any given time. Unhappiness will slowly raise over time in occupied cities until a revolution occurs, so don't go to war much.-------------------------------------------------------------------**Fascist/Dictatorship:** Increased Military unit production. Military units increase happiness, and annexing a city causes less unhappiness. Mass surveillance makes enemy spies half as likely to succeed, you recieve 2 extra spies.-------------------------------------------------------------------**Monarchy:** Can generate large amounts of tourism and gold in the late game. Between 30-50 turns, your monarch will die, prompting the player to select a new monarch from a slection of their children from a random list, such as either increasing rate of science or gold or culture or Golden Age points per turm, or increasing diplomatic relations, or increasing production of a unit type.-------------------------------------------------------------------Those are my ideas for unique Government types, what do you think of these?

Tech group is Western.Nations that were obliterated and became unsettled land no longer exist. Nations that were completely occupied by zed, but not destroyed have been reduced to only their few highest pop. provinces.Zombies inside nations are deleted, but zombies in unsettled land are simply rebel units that don't suffer from attrition. (wandering hordes)It could serve as a "sequel" to Apocalypse 1836, and give the player a chance to experience the rebuilding of civilization.

33n6zj	-54834	1429826257	paradoxplaza	Do you think the time period between EU: Rome (27BC) and CK2: Charlemagne (769AD) would make a good game?	With 3 project names revealed and all of them using the Clausewitz engine, do you think such a title could be in production? If not, I think it would make an awesome game, because it would give the player a chance to experience:1. The glorious time of Rome's consolidation of power in Europe.2. The rise of Christianity and Islam.3. The division of Rome, giving rise to Byzantium.4. The chaotic period during the invasions of many barbarians against the Western Roman Empire, and following it's untimely collapse.5. The dark ages that followed, as well as the rise of many new and unique nations and cultures.6. Other exciting, world changing things in that period that happened.Besides, if the necessary converters were made, EU: Rome (or Rome 2, if it's being developed) could be joined into the Paradox Grand Campaign. This means 2000 years to shape and conquer the world.What do you think? Would you like something like this to happen?

The Old world always remains the same, with all of their respective civs and CS in their proper locations.The Big change here is that across the Atlantic, the **New World is entirely random.** Populated by CS that can only advance to the medieval era and are much more likely to be attacked by the Old World nations.Just like how you can set the central terrain type of Donut, here you can select the "mini-script", used to generate the Western Hemisphere.Will you find the original Americas? Or will you find a couple of entirely new continents? Or will you find a very dense archipelago, maybe multiple large islands, or an oddly-shaped fractal continent? Or set it to random, so you have no idea what you'll find.The player will be motivated to settle this new world because all of the late-game resources will be located there. They will be in double quantity so nations left behind in the Old World can get trade deals.What do you think of this idea?

For example, you absolutely cannot stop the invasion of Poland unless you play as Germany itself. (or take incredibly drastic actions as another nation.)Therefore I have an idea. This is a game, not a simulator, so:What about a game mode where  all scripted events are removed completely, and are replaced by random major events, that may fire at random times?Imagine a HOI game with Russian rebels attempting to restore the Monarchy, Hitler chooses a more diplomatic approach to meeting his goals, France and Britain going to war over hegemony in Africa, and a coup detat leaves a Fascist USA.Even simple AI adjustments or randomly generating diplomatic ties between nations would be good.This could be a game where the player experiences what it was like back then: not knowing what the future holds.What do you guys think? It could make a great expansion pack.

Only hide, or incapacitate or maim if forced to fight.Such a character would offer a unique perspective on the Assassin-Templar War. They could perhaps show that peace can be achieved between the groups, maybe they could make their enemies reconsider their own morals.Maybe a future game could have the player character be spared by such a figure, and a gameplay mechanic could appear where playing a more pacifist style (e.g. only incapacitating, not killing innocent guards) could be rewarding as well as offering a unique challenge.What do you think of this idea?

3axxrx	-54834	1435146406	HotlineMiami	How about a mod (both HM1 and 2) that replaces all characters with Evan?	**I don't know how to make mods, so I am posting this in the hopes that someone will pick up this idea.**Is it weird that the levels featuring Evan are my favorite? All the characters are somewhat unique, but boil them down to the minimum level and they're pretty much identical in terms of gameplay.But Evan's gameplay is extraordinarily different from all the others with disarming guns and only maiming enemies.I feel a mod where you only play as Evan could really change how you play the whole game.The levels of Hotline Miami 1 would be perfect for this considering how condensed and small they are.Now I know that overhauls will be required, especially for Dead Ahead and the Soldier levels, as well as removing all Fatties and Dogs, but the end result could be a very great product, as if you are playing a new game.It is indeed possible to bring HM2 characters to HM1, as seen in the [Tony mod for HM1](https://www.reddit.com/r/HotlineMiami/comments/34trkg/ive_ported_the_tony_fan_mask_to_hotline_miami_1/) created by /u/AlexShumovOr it could work if you use the level editor to recreate all the levels and simply put Evan as the playable character.What do you think?

I have not even attempted it in V because the horrendous AI, while already stupid enough without mods, won't even so much as take a peak across the horizon.This needs to be fixed in Civ 6.V Terra really not-so-subtley shows the problems of the AI in IV and V.In IV, the AI would breed like rabbits, planting cities all over the place and searching for new lands to settle/conquer, while most V AI leans towards playing Tall. Maybe too tall.If we can assume Civ VI is like V, (considering how BE was a reskin) then adjustments to the AI should be made.Firaxis doesn't even have to worry that adjusting the AI for Terra will break them on other maps. They could simply insert some code like:if Terramap = 1    set AllAI: explorerate = *5    set AllAI: rateofsettlingfaraway = *5Yeah, it looks like sh*t. Sue me. But I'm sure you see my point.

My computer is incapable of handling EU4, and EU3 runs slowly.That is why I have got into the (possibly unknown) game of **FOR THE GLORY: A EUROPA UNIVERSALIS GAME**.It is basically a recreation of EU2, with added content.I want to create software that can convert province ownership and flags only, as my knowledge of code is extremely limited.I want to make a simple converter that will change province ownership and flags from **FtG -&gt; Victoria: Revolutions**.I'd like a retro Grand Campaign.Can anyone with converter experience help me?

If the steps are followed correctly, all tiles in the world will either be occupied by another civ, or already filled by your own military units, so there should be nowhere for it to go...

1hshuh	-54835	1373177952	ffxiv	People are really upset about this lightning stuff?	Hello, I am not trying to troll anyone first off.  I am just really curious because I have been reading the beta forums like I'm sure many of you have and I keep seeing this pop up.  People seem to be quitting the game over lightning showing up in the game.  Now I haven't looked much into this, but to my knowledge it's just an in game event.Is it really such a crime against humanity to have a Final Fantasy character show up in a Final Fantasy game?  I get that people may not like lightning but I don't think that is a reason to quit the game.To further add to this I saw someone ask if we might see things from Final Fantasy 7, a harmless question.  He gets an answer from a guy saying "Hate to break it to you XI/1.0 folks but this is now the market. Witness the death of a franchise."  Now what the poster was asking for was hair styles and weapons I believe.  Now I personally wouldn't like a hairstyle added because I think everyone would use it (He suggested Clouds).  I don't see the harm in maybe getting a weapon that looks like his though to have for fun.  Either way my point is this post was harmless and people react so negatively towards this.  So my question is are people really getting upset over things like this and if so why?
1kjzs3	-54835	1376756294	ffxiv	I'm having fun!	Alright seriously, I just got off the void known as the FFXIV Forums and I've come to the conclusion that they all hate the game.  I decided to make this on reddit because the community seems to be much better!All I want is to hear what you are enjoying about beta phase 4 so far.  Now I know there are some hiccups happening trying to create characters and such, but what online game doesn't have login issues right off the bat.  (D3 anyone?)  Anyways, I leveled a gladiator to 20 and am currently playing around on  a Marauder.  I think they added a bunch of quests because I ran around doing those and almost made it 20 just questing/fating.I haven't seen the housing stuff yet though, that is what I plan on looking at today.  I also want to see if I can see the new zones that are supposed to be in here.  All in all, I am really enjoying this game and even though I think it has it's areas that could be better I love it!Oh and one last thing.  The weather effects are amazing thus far.  I ahve seen the rain and the fog one a few times, they look awesome!  Actualyl now that I look at my game it looks like a thunderstorm is happening!So what do you think about beta phase 4 or the game in general?  By the way I'm playing on Ultros, my characters name is Kathalia Tael if your interested.

I tried to play magic 2014 today, the last of us, I even got on vent and talked to my old wow guild which stills exists surprisingly.  Anyways my point is, I just cannot play any games for more than five minutes without getting bored and looking around at more FFXIV stuff.  So I have to ask, what is everyone doing to past the next extremely slow day. . .?
1ll2gp	-54835	1378140366	ffxiv	Crashing when opening stuff.	So I am just curious because for the third time I am now stuck in 1017 hell from this issue.  Whenever I try to open other programs my game crashes. . . every . . single. . . time.  I am convinced at this point if I open calculator while it's running it will crash.  Now if I open three other games and then open it and get on I can switch freely between so as long as they've been previously opened and don't have to be restart.This is getting very annoying because I like most people (probably) have two monitors.  I switch to my other monitor for a second to open something and bam 2 hour wait to get back into FFXIV.It's really frustrating, so I was just wondering if I am the only one experiencing this.
1wdjho	-54835	1390923611	civ	New to civ!	Hey, so me and a few friends bought the gold edition and have been having a blast.  There have been a few things that I cannot figure out though.During one of the games I settled on a spot that had 3 tiles with 3 gold on them.  I improved them for +1 gold putting them at 4 gold from the tile.  Later in the game though I noticed that the tiles had improved somehow and were now giving +5 gold.  I've also noticed this with food tiles and production tiles.So I'm curious as to why this is happening?  Did I do something to further it's growth or do they upgrade over time if you work them for a long time?  I'm not sure, but this is something that I can't seem to find and answer for.  Any and all help would be greatly appreciated!
26pykv	-54835	1401305081	WildStar	Class perfomances	Hello, I want to start by saying that I completely understand the concept of play what you want.  I've put many hours into MMORPG's though and understand that this concept is not always accepted.I'm on the game right now and have been playing a medic (Love this class) and reading the general chat.  I noticed they started talking about how Medic and Spellslinger DPS at end game is really bad.I haven't seen much of the end game yet in detail so I don't know for myself and with the forums being down I can't exactly look through them at the moment.  I would like to play a DPS medic, but also try healing.My concern is though that their DPS will be so low compared to other classes that they will be only taken as healers.  (Kind of like paladins before the WOTLK buff, they may have dps, tank, and heal, but you can really only do one.)So I'm curious are these people in general chat wrong or do they know what they are talking about.  I imagine if it is that low that it will be buffed, but who knows how long that could take.  Then again they could be wrong and they could be fine, but I'm interested in what everyone else thinks!

2d5sjx	-54835	1407692240	firefall	Silver tokens	Hey, so long story short, a friend is getting all this stuff from silver tokens.  Me and another friend are having a tough time believing it because we've both spent more than we would like on crafting them in hopes of getting the stuff our friend says he has gotten.  I've looked around on google for a bit and haven't found exact answers so I'm coming here in hopes of getting some clarification.My friend has gotten dragonfly battleframe unlock and an omnidyne lgv.  He says they are both from silver tokens, but I've noticed the omnidyne lgv shows up under the gold ones.  He claims that you have a chance to get anything from any coin, you just have a higher chance the better the coins.To be frank, we're calling bs, but we would like to know before we spend anymore crystite.  Is it possible to get that stuff from silver vending tokens?  Furthermore is there a loot table or something like that for each of the coins where we could see a list of drops?
2xcxy0	-54835	1425051172	feedthebeast	Blood Magic Pipes not working	Hello, so I am setting up a second blood altar that is going to have a bunch of speed runes with it.  My original altar has a bunch of mob spawners by it right now with mostly sacrifice runes.The issue is I want that altar to basically generate blood and then store that blood in an iron tank which is draining into the other altar and keeping it full up.My sacrifice altar is working fine.  I have it hooked up to my iron tank with Thermal Expansion Fluiducts and it's constantly draining as long as there is blood which is what I want.  So then I build the other altar much closer to the tank and have it hooked up again with Thermal Expansion Fluiducts, but it only drains a little and then stops.For more exact numbers, I currently have 73,000 life essence in my Iron tank, and it is still draining in from my other altar.  I have my second altar draining from the bottom of the tank as I thought that could be the problem. My 2nd blood altar has 5000LP/10000LP  the pipes are empty.I just replaced the pipe connected to the iron tank and it instantly filled with blood, I hooked it back up to my second altar (it has 5 or 6 runes of dislocation on it atm) and it is draining into it just how I want.  The issue is it will eventually stop.  The pipes will simply just not draing blood from my tank anymore and I have no idea why.We have put a Pneumatic Servo on it and white listed life essence and it still eventually happens.Is it possible that the tank will only drain with so much in it?  You would think if there was 1000 in it then it would be able to drain 1000.Any help would be really appreciated!UPDATE:  For some reason it has been working just fine since I posted this, I haven't done anything different since posting this, but I will leave it in case someone knows why it was happening because that information could be useful in the future.
32imas	-54835	1428977724	ffxiv	New 50 questions	Hello, I just hit 50 on my first character which is a Warrior.  There is quite a bit at 50 and it's all a little confusing to me, so I decided to come here to ask some questions.  I have looked on google and I have looked at a guide for 2.5 hitting 50.I have done my duty roulette to get tomestones of soldiery and am now wondering how I can get more.  Everyone keeps telling me to run more stuff, but it's incredibly hard trying to keep agro when everyone outgears me so much.  So I'm wondering if there is a different way to get just some basic stuff to start doing at least a little better in these dungeons?  I don't have much gil so buying off the market board isn't too realisitic unfortunately.The next question is more Warrior related because I'm still learning everything, but to fix my threat problems would it be best to get a weapon first?  I mean I'll take what I can get, but I want to know what I should focus on.Thank you in advance for any help.
33780i	-54835	1429504251	WildStar	Returning player questions	Hello, I have read through the NEW &amp; RETURNING PLAYERS and didn't see the answer to this question so I want to ask a few basic ones here.1.  When it comes to leveling are instances at all good for it?  The reason I ask is because people in streams tell me they are worthless, but I just got like 1.4 levels out of one.  Is there a daily bonus I missed or something?2.  I heard crafting was useless from someone, but I remember liking it quite a bit before I quit.  Is it worth it to level it or is it really useless?That is all I can really think of right now.  I am enjoying the game regardless, but I really like the instances and wouldn't mind leveling from them.  That being said I do want to try and raid, so I don't want to do something completely inefficient for leveling.Thank you in advance for any replies!I wanted to add as a side note that I already have a 50 stalker.  I just want to know if instances are viable because if I recall they weren't and or it doesn't matter because I purely quested on my stalker.

I've convinced one of my friends to try the game via the free trial.

If that is true how are they doing it?

We only ever see raiding guilds recruiting and don't think they will take people leveling which means we basically only talk to eachother, so we decided to try and fix that!While the guild is new our purpose is just to be a place for casuals/levelers.  The leveling up process can be quite lonely and we're hoping to make a guild that will help bring together lower levels for a more enjoyable experience.Just send a whisper to Zero Fear or Im bad(those are both my characters) for an invite or more info or you can reply to this post.

I just wanted to ensure that I got my early access code put in right so I found something telling me I could go to my account and see Heavensward early access at the mogstation.  I did that a few days ago and it was there.I logged in tonight just to make sure I didn't need to put another code and "My account" looks completely different, but the one thing I noticed is that there is a table now showingA Real Reborn with little O's to mark that I have it on windows and i have the collector's edition.  Right below that is Heavensward which has no checks at all.  Now I'm questioning if it's actually there?I tried to follow the instructions to add the key but I don't see anywhere on my page to add an early access key.
3dijk5	-54835	1437060997	Skyforge	Stuck as berserker?	Hello, so I logged on the game today and I am a berserker even though I do not own the berserker. . .  I want to switch back to my Kinetic and when I try this pops up."If you change your class, you will not receive the additional reward.  You will not be able to switch back to the promo class."I am fine with this so I click the next button my guy does the changing class animation and at the end of the bar I stop glowing and just sit there.  I can't move, I'm still the berserker, and I can still use berserker abilities.  Is anyone else having this problem or does anyone know how to fix this?EDIT:  I resolved this issue.  To clarify, some were suggesting I was in a mission but I was not, I was sitting in the observatory.  I just went and did a x2 knight mission on my map and after completion it put me back as my kinetic.  I still don't really know how I ended up as the berserker in the first place.

During a [recent discussion about the Fukishima developments](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/g5kzv?sort=confidence), I came across [a description of the Reddit ethos by IPoopedMyPants](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/g5kzv/my_dad_works_in_a_nuclear_power_plant_in_the_us/c1l34mw) that caused me to ponder on the likelihood that many of us Redditors are also active (or occasional) Wikipedia editors (or even administrators?).  To what extent is this true?And of those of us for whom this *is* true, what sorts of knowledge-based synergies or commentaries on the nature of Online Communities can we cull from our cross-participation?  I'm only just getting started as a wiki editor, but already I'm discovering how effective navigation of the "behind-the-scenes", user-to-user deliberative process is a critical skill set for anyone hoping to contribute to Wikipedia.If this thread takes off, I'm thinking we push an IAMA Request for a Wiki administrator - there's about 1200 or so of them, and I bet there's a few hanging out on some of the obscure subreddits...  Those guys probably have a pretty unique viewpoint of the Internet and knowledge-gathering in general.

1yre2c	-54884	1393211576	NoFap	Lets try this	  Well I started fapping when I was 12, and I'm now 14 almost 15. I haven't had a girlfriend yet and I'm kinda shy when it comes to girls. When I was 13 I was masturbating daily and I thought It was good since I read articles saying its healthy. Though now that I've found out what it does to you I gotta stop.   I've tried multiple times in the past few months to stop and my record is 7 days. I just keep relapsing when I see a hot pic of a girl on social media or when I'm in bed. Now I'm taking this serious. I'm setting a goal for 2 weeks then a month and so on. I want to take porn and masturbation out of my life and find my real self I guess is what you can say. If anyone has any tips for stopping yourself from masturbating at a young age, or just in general, please comment it would help a lot.  
1yut1p	-54884	1393296119	NoFap	Social media triggers	Well I'm not sure if I should delete my social media accounts (Vine, Instagram, and other stuff). I could unfollow the people that cause triggers, but then that would mean unfollowing a lot of people and I could just delete my account. But is social media a bad thing? Should I just delete all my account to stop me from MO/PMO?

Is it ok if I haven't experienced anything major yet? I fapped for about 2 years straight so will the effects from not fapping come quicker then?

It felt so weird just masturbating after 245 days. The urge was overwhelming and I couldn't handle it. it felt so foreign after 245 days.I've learned a lot honestly. I become more confident, and more productive. Sorry for the short post just wanted to get this off my chest so I don't feel so bad the rest of the day.

1rwxlt	-54890	1385997780	AustralianShepherd	Aussies and exercise and heat	Hello! I'm in the process of trying to adopt a rescue Aussie and I am so excited! I'm an avid runner (3-6 miles a day/5x a week) and I want my new Aussie to be my running bud, especially this time of year when it is cold and dark out early. Anyways, I live in the mid-atlantic region and am probably moving farther south in the next year. Anyone know how Aussies do in heat? I obviously would not run her when it is 90 and 90% humidity, but I just want to see what you owners out there know! I can't find anything definitive on the internet. I just want to be the best Aussie mom possible! 
1tt5en	-54890	1388157236	Dogtraining	Introduced new dog, old dog is being aggressive. I need help!	Hi! So I have a corgi who is a 2 year old neutered male. We just adopted a 3 yo fixed border collie female (who is adorable and such a sweet little lady) last week. Since then, our corgi who has NEVER shown dominance, aggression, or anything like that, has attacked the new BC twice. No one got hurt, but man is it scary. I am just confused what I need to do as the owner of the two to make this situation livable and ultimately improve it. We got a second dog to keep our corgi company since he loves spending time with other dogs and gets depressed when we go home from the dog park, or houses where there are other dogs. I am so confused about why he is being vicious towards her. We have tried to show that he is "dominant" in the house by feeding him first, leashing him up first, and giving him treats first if we are doing obedience work basically showing them through actions that the corgi is #1 and the bc is #2. The BC does not really react to him aside from trying to protect herself. We know the corgi is the instigator and he goes after her. I just am at a loss to know what to do. The corgi has never tried to bite or acted aggressive to humans and is actually very timid and hides if people come over. We have shown him he is dog #1 in the pack after my boyfriend and I but he keeps doing this sort of thing.What do I need to focus on for training? How do I alleviate this situation? They seem to do well with eachother as long as there isn't something "prized" around. He attacked the BC last night because she was sniffing the tupperware I keep the treats in. Can someone help me? I love my corgi and he needs to come first, but I am falling madly in love with the BC as well... I need to figure this out before I become too attached. 
1uevbd	-54890	1388868418	Dogtraining	Loose leash walking help!	Hi! So I have a 60lb border collie female. She is wonderful indoors and will sit, stay, etc. fine. She listens and is extremely food motivated, that is until we get outside. When we get outside she goes nuts, won't listen, and will almost drag me down she pulls so hard. I'm worried about dislocating my arm, tearing a ligament in my knee, or something else BC of how forceful she is. I think she is just overstimulated by cars, people, squirrels, and other animals outside. I have gone through obedience with my other fog and everything we learned in class does not work with her outside. I've tried changing directions, carrying spoons with cream cheese, giving her treats to stay by me, and making her stop and sit then treating for that all to no avail. We are at our wits end. Any input you guys can offer, more things to try etc would be great. She is 3 and a rescue and not had leash experience before 10 days ago. I know it is fast to expect leash walking in 10 days, but she has picked everything else up incredibly fast. Any tips to at least encourage good behavior will be appreciated. Thanks! PS. I have watched kikopup's video and although interesting, her tactics aren't helping my dog. 
1v41c7	-54890	1389627518	Dogtraining	Border Collie won't poop on walks	Hello! I just adopted a BC who is about 3 years old. I've had her for about 3.5 weeks and for some reason she will not poop on walks. I take her on runs and she will poop when we run, but when I walk her she will not. We do 3 walks a day with a long walk (1 mile) in the afternoon and she refuses to go until we go on our run after. She won't go on the morning or night walk either. Unfortunately I can't run her every day and so on days we don't run, she won't poop. This led up to her pooping all over the house the other night while we were sleeping. Is there anything I can feed her so that she will poop on walks? Or how can i encourage her to poop? Currently she eats Blue Buffalo food. Thank you for any help you can provide!

1zxgu9	-54890	1394324325	BorderCollie	How can I manage my BC's prey drive?	I have posted on here and r/dogtraining about some issues [Imy bc Dixie](http://i.imgur.com/8YLyyuA)  has been having since I adopted her around Christmas. She is pretty reactive, but since we have been doing obedience and running consistently that has been managed pretty well. As she was a rescue, we don't know what her situation was before I got her (pretty sure she had never been walked on a leash before). However, the second she sees a squirrel or bunny she freaks out, lunges, barks, jumps, whines. She is big, around 55lbs, and even with an EasyWalk Harness she is hard for me to control when she gets like that. People think it is scary. Our trainer said she would think about what we can do to calm this behavior. Smelly treats don't do anything for her because a squirrel is more interesting than tasty meatballs or hot dogs. Her prey drive is SO STRONG. I think she might be mixed with a lab and perhaps this is why the drive is so strong? I'm just unsure. We exercise a lot. I run her about 4-5x a week up to 6 miles or 10k, she does obedience once a week, and we do work at home with obedience. She plays with my corgi and gets 3 walks a day regardless of running. While running she is an angel it is just when walking and we see a squirrel that we have issues. I'm at my wits end on what to do and I just want to know if some of you guys know how to manage this drive with your BC babies.  I figure some of you might have a breed specific knowledge that could help me. She is my first BC. THANKS IN ADVANCE :) 
20ko7i	-54890	1395000721	RunningWithDogs	Running Booties	Hey guys,Anyone have running booties for their pals? I was thinking about getting them for my [Dixie](http://i.imgur.com/8YLyyuA) for our long runs (+5 miles). She doesn't like the grass and will run on pavement and I'm just worried about stress fractures or ruining her pads. My trainer said no to booties since it could reduce her ability to sweat, which I feel like is valid. I'm just curious if anyone uses them, has used them, or has more information.

20zhga	-54890	1395398142	Dogtraining	Starting BAT today, anything I should know?	So I post in this subreddit a lot. I got a rescue border collie a few months ago and we have had plenty of issues with her. The good news is that she is improving so much and is a great family dog for us (myself, my boyfriend, and our corgi). The issues arise because she is reactive and we have been working on it with a little bit of success.However, yesterday there was an incident that happened that could have ended so poorly for everyone involved. I will be glad to elaborate if people want, but suffice to say it was a breaking point for me. I came home and immediately downloaded the BAT book to my kindle and I'm about halfway through. I'm determined to start this afternoon so I can get my dog rehabbed. We live in a nice residential neighborhood and people are starting to be scared of us and we are earning a not nice reputation. Obviously something needs to change.  I've brought up the reactivity issues with my trainer and she just says "make it rain treats." This has not worked at all for this dog and I feel like my trainer just isn't equipped to deal with reactivity on such a level. So I decided to try out BAT. I guess I just want to know, is there anything you guys would suggest for someone starting out with this training method? Anything you think a novice should know? Anything that worked especially well for you? I clicker train both my dogs so she will understand the marking. I guess if you just have suggestions/experiences/anything please let me know! I want to help my pup succeed! :) Thanks! 
21n7m6	-54890	1396060125	TwoXChromosomes	Really weird encounter and I'm super creeped out	Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, I just love reading everything on here and all the women on here give awesome advice/life experiences. Anyways, this morning I took my dogs for a walk, like I do every morning. It is still cold her so I had big sweats and a tee-shirt with a jacket zipped up on. I live in a small apartment complex where we have a courtyard and sidewalk/road on one side, and parkinglot in the back. It is cheap to live here so a lot of people who don't have money live here, some who are great and some who are creeptastic. This morning I am coming in from walking my dogs and I see a man talking on his cell in the courtyard. Weird, it was 7am but whatever maybe he needed a ride to work or something. He follows me into the building, and starts talking to me about my dogs as I am unlocking my door. At this point, I notice the GIANT BONER poking out of his pants. Like in Anchorman. But worse. This dude is mid 40s and sketch looking. I just got in my apartment as fast as possible and told my boyfriend. I  felt like he wanted me to see it. And that is what creeped me out. He kept trying to talk to me, and pet my dogs and all this other stuff. I havn't been able to stop thinking about how weird I feel. I don't want to see this person anymore but I'm pretty sure he lives in my building. Anyways I still have the heebie jeebies. Luckily I live with my boyfriend and have a giant dog. But still. Creeped. the. fuck. out. **TL;DR: Saw a random old man neighbor's giant boner this morning and I feel super creeped out by him.**
21vwlp	-54890	1396318397	justfinishedreading	JFR "The Accursed" Joyce Carole Oates	I just finished this and I don't know what to think. It took me forever to read (and I am not a slow reader), and I felt like it was kind of boring? I feel terrible saying that. I kept waiting for something really interesting/gruesome to happen and it kind of just bumped along talking about all these extraneous characters.I don't know if I'm just burnt out from reading too much GRRM and Stephen King where people are dying constantly and everything is gruesome and dramatic, but this was just SO TAME and I felt like there was no drama to it. There was drama but not. I don't know. I'm confused. This book was weird. I think if it had been shorter it would have been more enjoyable?Has anyone else read this? I'm just really confused by the last 700 pages I just read. Maybe I'm being obtuse about this, I just don't know because I normally pick up on the subtleties in books, or can at least appreciate them.I just don't know how I feel about this book. I want to say I didnt like it, but I don't know if that is totally true because I did like some parts of it. The ending was good, certain characters were fantastic and so interesting even though I felt like thy didn't add much to the story. I did enjoy the bones of the story but I wish it had had MORE. But also less because dang this thing was long.So this post is long too. Sorry! Has anyone else read this? What are your thoughts?
226k1g	-54890	1396609071	RunningWithDogs	Running in the heat	So I think winter is finally over (at least where I am... yay!) but because I live in the Mid-Atlantic, spring lasts for like 3 weeks and then it is like 80/90 and super humid until October. I only got my runnerdog in December, so I have not gone through a hot spell with her yet and I just want to keep her safe. I'm planning on doing all our running at 5am when it is dark and cooler for the spring/summer months. But I was wondering what everyone else does to help keep their pups cool? I saw outward hound makes a cooling bandanna and a cooling coat and I was thinking about getting one of these. What do you guys do to keep your runnerdogs cool in the heat??
22k9vo	-54890	1397001594	AskVet	Dog having severe diarrhea and vomiting	I'm pretty sure my dog ingested some bit of one of her chew toys. She has been having diarrhea since 2am (it is now almost 8pm) and just vomited 3x. I found a piece of the toy in the vomit, so I think this might be the issue. I'm also pretty sure she vomited because she drank too much water too fast. My question is, should I take her to my vet tomorrow or just wait it out? The toy is a burlap thing filled with fluff and she had ingested a piece of burlap. I feel like if there is any more bits, they should pass eventually. I'm just worried because her diarrhea is completely liquid.  She is a 55lb border collie (not overweight, just big... probably mixed with lab) 3yo, spayed. She occasionally gets into the trash and will lick meat containers and stuff but I can't imagine that doing this... and she hasn't been in the trash in the past 24 hours. Help?

237z3r	-54890	1397688210	AskVet	Severe Bloody Diarrhea	Ok my dog (female, border collie mix, 3yo spayed) had some vomiting and diarrhea last week that ended up clearing up on its own. She had swallowed a piece of burlap. Anyways, yesterday my boyfriend came home and she had puked and pooped in her crate which is really unusual. While I was cleaning it up, she had diarrhea again but with bright red blood in it. I rushed her to the emergency vet and they just gave her metronidazole, probiotics, some gastrointestinal food and sent us home and said come back if it doesn't resolve in a few days. They said her energy level was fine so she was probably fine (???)I came home today, and she had pooped in the house again, diarrhea with bright red blood. I'm just really concerned. Before we adopted her, when the rescue pulled her she had mammary masses so I am worried about the possibility of a tumor inside her colon. We have a longstanding vet appointment on Friday for her annual exam, but I don't know if I should take her in tomorrow instead. I am just really worried and upset. 
23un53	-54890	1398339022	RunningWithDogs	Helping my dog cope with the heat	Just wanted to share what I've been doing with my girl since it has been consistently over 60 where I am. She wears a yellow bandanna (for her reactivity) and I have been soaking it down before we leave in cold water and then putting it on right before we go. She seems to like it. I have also been carrying a Gulpy with us, and even though she won't drink, I spray her down with it half way through on anything over 3 miles. Plus she looks adorable in her yellow bandanna! :) I'll post a picture if I can get her to sit still this morning haha.

I posted a photo at the bottom. Since you ladies are all pros I was wondering if you could help a first timer out. I've never dyed my hair before and it is about shoulder length chestnut brown medium thick neither wavy nor straight but somewhere in between. I work in a really conservative office so colors aren't an option, but I thought ombré would look pretty. I'd be doing this at the salon. Maybe like a honey caramel color? The only thing is, I wear my hair straight most days and rarely curl it. Would ombré look ok? It seems most people wear their ombré hair curled. Anything would be helpful.

Dixie and I did 8 miles on Saturday on pavement and I just wanted to give her body adequate rest to prevent injuries. We skipped Sunday and Monday runs and went last night. When we do 3-4 I don't worry about giving more than 24hrs but on really long runs, I feel like she should have more rest.

So I just got engaged like a week ago (yay!) and I've been lurking here for a while looking at everyone's pretty dresses and reading about all the things! Anyways, his mother wants to have an engagement party for us. We are currently trying to buy a house and move states and I just started grad school, so I feel like doing all this engagement stuff is kind of ridiculous (for us). I really just want to skip it and have people save their time, energy, and money for our wedding. We are thinking of getting married December 2015. Am I being ridiculous? I feel like I might break my mom's heart if I don't do all the traditional stuff. But I also feel like some of this stuff is new and didn't exist when she got married 30 years ago. Did y'all do engagement parties and photos?

So I've only been engaged a little over a month and I havnt started planning anything because my FH and I are currently buying a house,moving, working ft, and I'm in grad school. So not a lot of free time at the moment. Over the weekend we visited his sister in New York and she wanted to take me dress shopping. I wasn't too keen on the idea because I'm wholly unprepared. We went to a store and didn't have an appointment. I was dressed in just like yoga pants and a tee and my hair was dirty. I didn't feel pretty at all. Anyways, the store squeeZed us in which was really nice but the appointment made me feel just downright awful. Nothing fit, I felt like I looked like a whale, and the girl unzipped me in the middle of the salon. I wanted to cry. Is this normal? I just don't know if I was overwhelmed or what. Has anyone else felt like this? I'm almost ready to elope and it has only been a month... Also sorry for any typos, I'm on my cell phone
2fr93k	-54890	1410129776	AskVet	Trifexis Overdose	Hi! So I have two dogs, one who receives the "extra large" dog dose of trifexis (60lb female border collie) and the other who receives "large" dog dose (35lb male corgi). This morning (7:30am) while doing flea and tick and trifexis, I realized I gave my corgi the extra large dog dose. After 3 hours he vomited. I called my emergency vet and they said as long as he doesn't continue to vomit he will be fine. He has not vomited again, but he is lethargic and not super interested in food. I just hand fed him some rice but it seemed like he had to force it down. Normally he slurps rice up as fast as possible. Is there anything I can do to help? The vet said it wasn't an emergency so I guess I'm just looking for a second opinion. Is this type of overdose fatal? Or should I just watch him carefully the next few days?

After breaking them up and separating them, I realized my bc (female/spayed/3yo) had pierced her lip with one if her teeth. She rubbed her muzzle on the ground and got the lip off the tooth. She won't let me touch it but doesn't appear to be in extreme pain.  She is currently snuggled up with me. Is there anything I should do to keep it clean? It isn't a gaping hole. She is not bleeding anymore, it stopped quickly. She takes anxiety meds so I gave her those in hopes that it would take the edge off if she was in pain. I'm just worried about possible infection.

My FH and I are not planning a huge wedding because we would prefer something small and intimate. We have elected not have children in attendance because neither of us is interested in that plus weddings are boring for kids anyway (spoken from personal experience as a child who tried to lite pumpkins on fire at a wedding out of boredom...whoops). Not many people we are inviting have children, and my question is when/where do we put "this is an adults only event"? I'm planning on offering babysitting services to those who do have kids. Do I include this on the save the date? Or just the invitation? Additionally, my aunt ignored my cousins request earlier this year and brought her 14yo son to his wedding. I'm not really ok with that age group either and would like to reinforce the over 18 idea.   So to cut to the chase,  do I put it on the STDs or invitations or both?

2rbybx	-54890	1420405242	weddingplanning	Question about helping a friend	Hi all! You ladies and gents have given me a lot of good advice regarding my own wedding so I thought I'd come and pose this question to you all. One of my best friends got engaged a few weeks after I did and I am so happy for her! Her fiancé is great and she is wonderful. She has 7 bridesmaids of which I am one. She is currently in graduate school and accruing tons in student loan debt. Her family can only give her a small bit of money due to some serious family issues right now. She broke down the other night telling me about how stressed she is about her family, planning a wedding, and school, and she feels that I am her only friend that gets it due to my own family issues etc. My thought was, what if I asked all the bridesmaids if we could all give her a little bit of money (100-200 each) to ease her burden. Do it in secret and mail it to her anonymously. Is this overstepping my bounds? I know it wouldn't be a ton of money, but that could be her chair/table rental or alcohol or whatever. What do you think?

2saum0	-54890	1421170953	weddingplanning	Dealing with people inviting themselves...	Hi! So for the most part wedding planning is going well for me! It's moving along and I'm pretty much almost done! Anyways, over the summer my FH and I went to a wedding right after we got engaged. I was drunk and am pretty sure I "invited" a bunch of people. I was excited we were engaged and having a good time. We hadn't planned anything at all. Fast forward to yesterday and one of the people at that wedding texts me telling me she is so excited and can't wait and wondering what day exact so she can plan to come (it's cross country from her). I didn't really know how to respond so I just said the date. Some back story(feel free to skip) we were very close friends for 4 years and had a big falling out about 4 years ago. We hadn't spoken until this past summer. While it was great to see her and reconnect, I haven't forgotten the mean things she said and did and am hesitant to let her back in my life. Also her and my bridesmaid HATE each other, which was also a byproduct of that fight. I wasn't planning on inviting this person as we are having a very small wedding. Do I just let her know now, or wait, or what? I wasn't even planning on sending out STDs until June. Ughhhh I hate this. I really wish I could invite everyone, but that just isn't feasible. Help?

2t2qyh	-54890	1421779065	dogs	Question about behavior	So I have a border collie mix who has had some behavioral issues in the past that we have thankfully almost moved past (shoutout to /r/dogtraining). She is a 4 yo spayed female and we have had her for a little over a year. She does different greetings for my fiancé and I when we come home. For me she jumps and tries to lick my face and then runs around like crazy and is like "OMG ITS MOM!!!" For my fiancé she runs up to him and immediately flips over and wags her tail at him but is laying on her back. He rubs her belly and she gives him kisses and then he will let her outside to go potty. She does this in the morning when he wakes up too. Why does she give us such different reactions?

It is a LED dog collar attachment that clips onto your dogs collar or harness. I tested it out yesterday and it is SUPER bright. I found it for $15 at my pet store which is cheaper than the site. Just wanted to pass it on to you all! Gotta keep the puppas safe! :)
2uej2l	-54890	1422795239	weddingplanning	First dance song question	So my fiancé and I have completely different taste in music. Coming to an agreement on a first dance song has been next to impossible because he doesn't care for what I suggest (and to be fair at one point I did suggest 98 degrees). We don't have a "song" that is ours for some reason. I don't know if I ever thought about it until we got engaged. Anyways, I asked him about Ed Sheeran's new song, "Thinking Out Loud" and he actually liked it. But the more I listen to it I feel like there are some weird lines in it, but overall it has good sentiment and meaning. In yall's opinion, would that be a weird first dance song? 
2vcyls	-54890	1423526738	Dogtraining	Reactivity to selective things...	Hi! So I have a border collie mix and she is super sweet. We had some issues with leash reactivity and have worked through a lot of that. Dogs don't phase her for the most part anymore. She has a high prey drive and squirrels, bunnies, and cats get a reaction but not super crazy. She mostly just lunges but when I correct her she stops and calms down. However, when we see unusual critters she absolutely loses it. She can get snappy with my other dog due to her agitation. This has happened three times in 6 months with an opossum, a raccoon, and most recently this morning with a fox that darted out right in front of us. She got real nasty real fast. How do I train this down to a reasonable level? We don't see these critters hardly ever and I can't take her to a wildlife refuge because that would just put her over her threshold. Any thoughts? Advice?

I dreamed that we were having it at my parents house and no one showed up except this girl that I don't like from college. She took one look at me and left. Then I realized that my FH wasn't there and I was crying in my dad's arms, BUT THEN I realized my dress didn't fit and was totally ruined. I woke up at 3am like WTF. Dreams... So weird. Fingers crossed none of that will happen for real. Any of you guys had wedding nightmares???

We have a lot of space, and I'd like to plant a garden. I don't have a green thumb, but would like to try to plant some hearty veggies or herbs that I could grow and tend. We do receive a lot of rain, and it is fairly hot/humid here. I don't know much about this, such as what kind of bed I should make for my garden (raised? just in the ground?), what kind of plants would be best, and where I can find resources to help me grow healthy plants. I'm not really sure what my question is, but if you all have resources you can point me in the direction of that would be great! Or just suggestions or advice :)

318xsn	-54890	1428015729	careerguidance	Should I stay in my current role (HR) or leave to pursue different options?	Hello... please  let me know if this is not the appropriate sub for this post.After a few years of trying to figure out what I want to do, I think I've finally settled in on HR. I've been doing it as a temp for the past 7 months and really enjoy the work and feel that being a HR Generalist would be a really good career path for me. As I mentioned, I've been temping for the past 7 months internally at a temp agency and it has been pretty great experience, but the benefits and pay are terrible. About a month ago my boss approached me and said she had a permanent job offer for me where I would split time between HR and payroll. I was so happy as I love the company and the culture. She kept promising me she'd have info and an offer to me every 3-4 days. I started to get afraid and frustrated and have been applying elsehwere and have gotten some interviews but no offer yet. My dilemma arises because she gave me the "offer" last Friday. Although I'll be splitting time between HR and payroll, I wont be a permanent employee, benefits will still be terrible, and I won't be making any more money. I asked for a week to think on it. The CFO told me today he is working on my training schedule for the next few weeks, meaning they are assuming I'm taking the position.I have a job interview for a similar position to one I'm in now, but with good benefits and higher pay on Tuesday. My fiance and father both are encouraging me to leave my current role and hope that I get something better in the next month or two. I guess I'm just looking for an outside opinion on this. I know a job is better than no job, but if I accept this position at my current company, I won't have freedom to interview elsewhere. Help?

33yy80	-54890	1430090715	weddingplanning	This is why we can't have nice things [RANT]	So I'm getting married in about 7 months. Planning has been smooth for the most part and we are so close to finalizing everything (yay!). My mom asked me to give my brother a call today to catch up and see what is going on in his life. He told me he is going to propose to his girlfriend soon. They are high school sweethearts and although they just took like 1.5 year break, they are back together and them getting engaged is not a suprise. I asked him to please NOT get married before us, as I would like to have this time in my life for everyone to focus on myself and my fiance. That might sound selfish, but idk that is just how I feel.Anyways he kind of sighs and goes "well... we don't really want to have a long engagement..." ummm wHAT???? So basically what he was telling me is that hes going to get engaged and probably get married a month or two before me. AWESOME. Ugh I'm so frustrated!!!! My fiance's sister is getting married 2 months before us and I'm already stressed out about that, although she is marrying a foreigner and they are doing it so they can finally live on the same continent. But still first his sister, and now my brother????Sorry I just needed to vent. BLAH. On a positive note, I had my first fitting and I love my dress more now than ever :)
340qjw	-54890	1430135053	weddingplanning	[RANT] Seriously brother?!?!	So wedding planning is going well. I'm almost done (yay!) even though we are 7 months out. My FMIL is great, and my  mom hasn't been unhelpful so that has been nice.My mom asked me to call up my little brother yesterday and see what he is up to. He told me that he is going to propose to his girlfriend soon. I am so happy for him, and they have been dating on and off for like 5 years and were high school sweethearts.And maybe this is selfish of me, but I kind of want this year to be about me and my FH. I want my mom and dad to focus on me, as they often have just left me to my own devices because I'm so "independent." Also, I know my brother and what he wants he gets. I said to him, "please do not get married before me. This is my year."He kind of sighed and goes "we will try to respect you, but we don't really want a long engagement." UM WHAT. NOT COOL BRO. So now my fiance wants to send out our save the dates now, so that people will plan for our wedding first. I called my mom and told her, and she goes "oh I had a feeling your brother might try to race you down the aisle." WTF MOM!!! I asked her to tell him no, that they can't get married until like Feb or March. She said she will talk to him and try to discourage him. Keyword try. Ugh. Gah I feel like a crazy person and a terrible sister, but I just want this one thing! End rant. Sorry ya'll :(

355vxr	-54890	1430996697	weddingplanning	STD address issue (gaffe?)... HELP	Hi! So I'm going to send out my save the dates tomorrow, so I need to address them tonight. I'm running into issues with one part of my family I'm going to invite and I don't know how to address them. My aunt and uncle have 4 kids, the two oldest are in college and the two youngest are 8th and 9th grade. We are not having anyone under 18 at our wedding.  The two oldest kids are home for the summer, and said to use their parents address as theirs. So how do I address STDs to my aunt and uncle, and their two oldest kids but not the two youngest?This is so petty but I feel like if I write Mr and Mrs so and so and family, it implies everyone is invited but if I just do Mr and Mrs so and so, then send a separate STD to each older cousin, it is really going to make a point that the younger two aren't invited. I don't want to hurt feelings and I definitely don't want to offend my favorite aunt. Is there a tactful way of doing this? 
35s07y	-54890	1431478221	AskVet	Very itchy (in two spots) dog	I'm on mobile. But specs:Dog-- border collie mixFemale, spayed~4 y/oSymptoms: itching her sides while standing with her back feet. Happening since Sunday. Treatment: she gets flea and tick treatment. once a month and her heartworm pill once a month. I was 2 days late on her flea and tick treatment this month. Question: I know she doesn't have fleas but what could be a cause of her itchy-ness? I felt her sides and didn't feel any lumps or bumps, or lesions. And  to my knowledge she doesn't have any allergies. I've never seen her itch so consistently in one spot and am just curious about what is going on? Should I give her a gentle oatmeal bath?Would Benadryl help? Does it have the same effect in dogs as in people (antihistamine)? This is our first spring in the area we live so I guess allergies might not be out of the realm of possibility? It doesn't seem to be bothering her, I'm just curious about it. She was groomed about 10 days ago, but has never had a reaction to the shampoo before. Plus that seems like quite a delayed reaction.

38jpfe	-54890	1433440568	weddingplanning	Bachelorette Party Question	This is probably a really dumb question but I'm stuck on wether or not to invite a friend to my bachelorette. Background: I have a lot of really close friends who I have been close with for over 6 years, some as long as 20 years. I knew that picking only 2 girls to be bridesmaids would hurt feelings and so I opted to choose just one good friend and my FH's sister. Everyone understood and I explained to my close friends why I was doing this and that I wanted them to come do my bachelorette party with me. In September FH and I moved to a new city and I made my first REAL friend in this town in January. We are pretty close and hang out a lot but I'm still growing into the friendship.My dilemma arises in, should I invite my new friend to my bachelorette party? I think she will really feel left out if I don't, but I've only known her 6 months and I'm just hesitant about throwing her in with all these people I've known for a long time. I don't know how to talk to her about it because it is all of my friends going and not just bridal party. She is invited to te wedding and I really enjoy her company but it is a new friendship and that is where I'm torn. Am I just being silly? Am I over thinking this issue?
38nf8s	-54890	1433498849	weddingplanning	Really proud of my FH!	We are having a small wedding and that is how we wanted it. My mom and dad are paying and have been pretty good about guest lists. My FH is from the midwest, and they moved around a lot when he was a kid. He knows his immediate cousins really well, but he doesn't know any of his mom or dad's cousins and their kids. When we came up with  a guest list we did his aunts and uncles and then a few close family friends of his parents. We thought it was nice to include the family friends...His mom has kept mentioning inviting all of her cousins (around 30 people) and their kids. One of whom has some mental issues and has been arrested for prostitution at the casino... I pulled him aside when I heard this and was like, "you need to handle this." He agreed.Last night, his mom was talking about his sisters wedding in October in Germany (we are in US) and how some of her cousins and their kids are going to go, including the former casino prostitute. She then was like "they are so excited for your wedding too!" My FH looked right at her and was like "Mom, no one outside of my aunts and uncles and cousins are invited. End of story so don't invite them"So so so proud of him for standing up and saying something! I literally cannot wait to marry this man. Also, I feel like FMIL inviting her cousins to my FSILs wedding is strange and my guess is that my FSIL has no idea this is going on...
39p98s	-54890	1434199025	AlAnon	Me (26) and MIL (60?)	This is my first time posting in this sub, and I'm not sure if this is right or not. But if it is not please let me know where to go. My mother in law is a raging alcoholic. 10am, drink in hand, drinks until she passes out, wakes up starts again and then drinks until she passes out around 7pm. She has gotten a DUI recently at 2pm on a Wednesday, and I can't remember the amount but it was either double or triple the legal limit. I'm frustruated because my fiance recently had major surgery and she was supposed to help me care for him, as I couldn't get the time off of work. Instead she got drunk as a skunk and was bumping into him, leaning on him, and really could have undone all the progress the surgery made. If he had fallen, she wasn't even sober enough to call 911. I'm burning with anger over this. This is her SON who NEEDED her and she couldn't stay away from the bottle for 24 hours. I'm just burnt up over it and it makes me so damn MAD. We are talking about having kids in a few years, and I just feel like I couldn't trust her to hold a baby without dropping it, or forgetting about it. My fiance is struggling to talk about his feelings with it and just says things like "I'm done with her" which tells me he is just very hurt inside about it. I just don't know what to do. His dad is in the picture but is checked out about it all. He denies there is a problem. Should we be attending meetings? Or should my FH be going to therapy alone? Together? I'm just confused. I know his mom is not going to change. But how can I support my fiance (and possibly myself) through dealing with this issue? What resources are out there?

3cf209	-54890	1436271470	weddingplanning	Why do weddings make people act like a crazy person?? (Rant/vent/emotions)	So I've posted before about my brother and how in May he announced he was going to get engaged this summer and squeeze in a wedding before mine in December. A lot of people felt that I was being entitled, and I know that I do not have control over him, or the year etc. But some stuff has happened and I'm just so upset. Background: my brother is 2 years younger and the "golden child" which both my parents admit. They admit that people love him more and that yes they were harder on me and gave him whatever he wanted.  My mom also told me she was surprised I found anyone who would marry me in the first place because I'm just so average. Now on to why I'm upset (if those comments were not enough...) my brother proposed on Friday and immediately Saturday everyone is celebrating, there is a party, and my whole family is losing it over him. When I got engaged a few people said "congrats!" And that was it. My dad had made it explicit that my brother needed to wait at least 9 months to get married in order to do some counseling, get a job (cuz oh yeah, neither of them have them), and move to the same city. I was fine because then I figured out family could come to my wedding and then his after in the spring. Good plan. Plus I do think the pre-marital counseling is important. It might be important to add that my brother is 23 and his fiancé is 21. My brother has been texting me asking about dates for October and November. FH and I are booked up all month which leaves November... My brother is legit trying to get married like 4 weeks before me. Am I crazy for being upset? My feelings are so crushed that he can't take off his rose colored glasses for 2 minutes and see that this is not nice. My mom and dad are now saying that I just need to suck it up and let him do what he wants even if it means no one will come to my wedding. I am crushed that my parents are basically saying "you are not as important" and that he is able to do this. I told him that my feelings are hurt and that I don't think it is respectful to me, but he just doesn't get it. I think I need to go see a counselor or something because this is bringing up a lot of hurt that I've carried for years, and that once again my feelings Are invalidated because of what he wants. We are almost exactly 5 months out to my wedding and its getting to be crunch time. I'm just heartbroken over all of this and want to throw in the bag and say screw it and elope with no one except my FH.I guess I'm the one acting crazy here but is it really too much to ask that my family choose me this one time? Sorry for the rant/vent. I am just so torn up. Tl;dr: my brother is going to squeeze a wedding in a few weeks before me and my parents love him more so I just have to deal with it and am heartbroken.

3e08b8	-54890	1437434454	whatsthisbug	Eastern North Carolina - White tick?	Hello! So I was just mowing my lawn and had finished up. My lawn mower is black and as I wheeled into my garage I noticed something white on it. I bent down to look at it and it looked EXACTLY like a tick, except completely white. Probably about [this size](http://scitechdaily.com/images/deer-tick-finger.jpg) and that shape but solid white. It was not engorged. As I leaned down to get a closer look it jumped away. It leaped in the air and landed on the ground somewhere (hopefully not on me). I treat both my dogs for fleas and ticks and have not found anything on either one all year. I do weekly inspections as well as when we are playing. My question is, can a tick be white? Was it a tick? Or am I just being paranoid? Sorry I don't have a picture of it specifically.

3haotj	-54890	1439803429	Dreams	Bizarre Pregnancy Dream... what does it mean?	I'm a gal in my mid 20s, and am about to get married in a few months! I am so excited. I dreamed last night that I finally went to the doctor, which I have been putting off for months (in real life). They asked if I was pregnant and I said no, but they wanted to do an ultrasound anyway. Turns out I was 6 months pregnant. I cried and cried tears of joy and didn't even care about being due right before my wedding. I woke up shortly thereafter and am feeling super weird about it. People around me are pregnant or have small children and I don't know if it is  influencing me. I'm kind of sad right now because it isn't true, when most days I'm not really sure if I want a kid before I'm 30. So this is weird. Maybe I just need to go see the doctor, because I really have been putting that off. Any thoughts? If I am leaving out relevant (real life) details please let me know if it would help in your interpretation. 
3hccht	-54890	1439835210	AskHR	How much is too much over sharing?	I'm a contractor at a large company. It is a really great job and there is a pretty high conversion rate. We are going through some structural changes and the upper level management has made it fairly clear that they are looking to convert soon. My team recently had a new manager hired as part of this structural change. She had 1 on 1 meetings with everyone on the team. In the meeting she asked what our career goals are and how our job now plays into that. She also encouraged me to be open and honest with her. I shared that I wanted to grow into a broader role than I am in now and hoped to be a HR Generalist one day. I shared that I wanted to learn from others on my team who work with ER, benefits, scheduling, TA, etc. She told me that was great and was glad I shared it with her. She called me into a meeting today to ask me if I really liked my job and if I wanted to stay. She said she felt I didn't want to be here and was just doing this to do this. I seriously thought I was about to get fired. She then shared she only wants people on the team who want to do the work and aren't anxious to leave. I left the meeting feeling upset. I feel that I should have not shared my career aspirations with her because it made her think that I don't want to be here, when I do. My question is, did I share too much? What are you supposed to say when you are in that position? I was under the impression that not striving to grow and learn is looked down upon. Is it?I'm just confused about how I should have handled these meetings. 
3hivqf	-54890	1439946994	offmychest	I lost my job today and I am sad	I got fired today. I'm really sad as I loved the role and don't understand what it is I did wrong. They said it wasn't performance based but my new boss simply didn't like me. So I guess I didn't really do anything wrong except exist. 
3hyv4s	-54890	1440251237	xxfitness	Anyone need a new pair of running shoes?	Hi everyone,My parents got me a new pair of [running shoes](http://www.shoes.com/womens-saucony-fastwitch-6-blue-pink-p2_id320115?adtrack=gpa&amp;amp;term=Women%2527s+Saucony+Fastwitch+6&amp;amp;offer=&amp;amp;device=c&amp;amp;network=g&amp;amp;matchtype=&amp;amp;mkwid=&amp;amp;creative=59078052793) in size US 7. I tried them on, and even though I normally wear a US 7 in Saucony, these are WAY too small. They bought them on sale and we can't return them so I thought I would send them to someone who really needs them. I would say that they would fit someone who is a 6.5 or a 6 really well. I see a lot of posts about not being able to afford quality gear and I would hope that these shoes could help someone get on the track to fitness. Plus they look sweet! I wore them on one half mile walk with my dogs, but aside from that they have not been worn (to my knowledge). Let me know if you are interested and I will mail them to you. Unfortunatly I'm tight on money myself so I can only send in the continental US. I don't think I could afford to ship internationally. :) The shoes have been claimed! I just want to say I wish I could give shoes to everyone who needed them, and maybe it would be a good idea if there was some sort of gear exchange for new/unused/gently used things. Cheers ladies! 😄

We are getting married in a few months and I don't know if I am just nesting or what, but I am really really wanting a baby. It really isn't a great time for us, so we are going to wait another year or two, but how do you deal with these baby crazy feelings? Should I go hang out with a baby or something? I wasn't really sure I wanted kids then BAM and now I do. So this is weird for me. How do I handle this? 
3i787l	-54890	1440423506	GetEmployed	Question about following up and not looking desperate	I interviewed for a job on Thursday and it went really well. I dropped off handwritten thank you cards on Friday morning. The HR manager said I would know by Wednesday of this week regarding the position. My question is, is sending an email today (Monday) too much? Would that make me look desperate? Or if I don't hear by Wednesday follow up with an email then?I don't want to put out desperate vibes, even though that is pretty much how I feel right now.

3il76m	-54890	1440676696	namenerds	You all make me want to have a baby!	I am getting married soon, and my fiance and I have kind of started talking about names for our future progeny! Reading all these interesting and great names makes me want to have a baby so bad, as if my baby fever wasn't already bad! For a girl we have talked about Leona and calling her LuLu but we don't have a good middle name. For boys, I would love to do James John and call him JJ. My father's name is James and my FH is a John Jr. but doesn't want to do the III so I feel like this is a good compromise, except that he hates it for some reason. Anyways as we aren't having a baby for at least another two years we have plenty of time to think about it. In the meantime, I'll just keep lurking on your posts and loving all the names! :)

If you need a break from the rediculousness of your family, or just wedding stress in general please watch this show for a good laugh. I just discovered it on Netflix and have been CRACKING UP at how out of control  these brides are. I'm sure like 80% of it is for the camera but I watch and am like "you know what, sweetlax30007 you are doing ok!" Also whoever is doing the voiceover is totally snarky and calls them out on their BS and it is pretty funny. I find when I watch like Say Yes to the Dress or 4 Weddings I get a little overwhelmed but the antics on this show just make me laugh.

Do I address it to Ms. Sally Smith &amp; Mr. Bob Buns? Or just send it to Ms. Sally Smith and Guest, or just send two invitations? In one situation I don't know her SO, in another it is my brother's fiance but they live in different states right now. And in a few others it is just couples that don't live together.

2m8m78	-54895	1415927612	heroesofthestorm	should the core have more health?	i think the core should have a little bit more health, in many games when the defending team have no forts left, the attacking team instead of having 5v5 fight next to the core, they just try to nuke the core as fast as possible and sometimes it works with only 1-2 to heroes lefti think when you lose like that,its not fun to play or to watch and i dont think this increase in health will make games any longerso what do u guys think?

398quu	-54895	1433901246	starcraft	petition to remove the disruptor before its too late	two month has passed since the start of the beta and after testing and playing with the disruptor, i realized that disruptors causes more problem that it solves.first of all, in lower leagues , with no ability to split well and with no good multitasking, you can lose all your army without you even looking by two disruptors,also it would be hard to balance across all leagues , players always complained about storm because its is too strong, disruptos are way worse than that because their damage is instant unlike stormsecondly, protoss doesnt need more aoe ground splash, dirsuptos overlaps too much with the high templar, one of the many complains players had about protoss is that they have too much aoe with colossi and hightemplar, so i dont really understand the addition of disruptorsso i suggest removing the disruptor and adding another unit to the robo that has splash damage against anti air, i think that makes sense because robo doesnt have anti air and that make the robo more versatile , also protoss doesnt have good anti air so i think this unit is a good approach in dealing with the problems that protoss has in lotv

1gtmjg	-54899	1371852772	leagueoflegends	Other ways to rank up in soloq?	Honestly, im not saying i deserve to be in platinum or gold or diamond or anything really this is just a suggestion.I was just wondering if Riot could please come up with another game idea or something to be able to make our solo q rank go up. Because honestly as many times as i win my lane, and try to be positive with my team and discuss ganks, or anything along those lines i still tend to lose the game. I know i could be higher than wha tim currently at but thats besides the point. Playing with randoms is very hard to communicate with because everyone thinks they are better than everyone but this is not the case MOST of the time.I know that there alternative rankings such as 5v5 and stuff, but the problem with that is most of the people there are going to be practicing starts and stuff and I am not able to play daily and if my team or the team wants to practice certain strats or idk play games i will not be available to make it hence why i havent bothered on joining a team.Well yeah, I just wish there was other ways that you could rank up your solo queue rank another way, no i don't know how but i feel that there should be another way so that the people that deserve to be in other divisions shouldn't be stuck in a division they are currently in because of people that do belong there ruin your experience.IE: I'm currently in silver division IV, When i first started ranked games i started in Bronze Division V, The reason for this was because durring the placing games i was like playing as if it was normal games, and at that time tbh i wasn't really trying hard i just did wut ever. I climbed Bronze fairly easy but still it took me about 100 games to get out of there. Now ive been playing for like 300 games in silver 5 i have jumped to silver 2, two times now and everysingle 1 of my silver games i have dominated my lane. But when it gets to team fighting, my TEAM manages to just lose teamfights, and im always the one that comes out of the fight alive with like a kill or 2 while the rest of my team dies and we lose. I honestly have the skills for Gold+ i know i do because i alwayyyyyyys always always dominate my lane always like always. i dont even know wut to say i just want to have decent ppl in my games i know i said i didnt care where im placed bu yeah i do, and i need to be gold or higher.tl:dr: Make a way for people to rank up their solo queue ranking to where they belong without having to play with scrubs that will bring them down and ruin their experience.Edit: I know i misspelled a whole bunch of stuff, please ignore.

The converted document from these services is messed up formatting because of the tables, the converted doc doesn't recognize the tables, it's shown as some kind of image. However, I can still edit the text. But when I do that, the table size does not change automatically, it keeps the table size same and just hides any text that goes beyond its boundary.I've lost the original document now and I only have the pdf with me.The original document was created using Word 2010 if that helps. I was hoping to find something that will reduce my formatting efforts. Any thoughts?

But why am I getting charged 1% or 2% even if I purchase things on my debit card? This is theft.If I'm purchasing anything from you using my debit card, it has the LEAST risk. The money is directly getting transferred from my account to yours! **Why are you charging me MORE for doing that?**If I write you a cheque, or pay by cash, it's costlier to you as a shopkeeper because not only you have to wait, you have to spend your energy and time in depositing them in the bank. It's costlier to everybody, even to the bank. So I don't understand why would banks charge the shopkeepers for debit card payments either.I don't remember getting charged until about a couple of years back. What happened? Can we file a complaint somewhere against this bullshit?What am I missing?**Edit : Please upvote this for everyone's benefit.**

It's a brilliant movie about a scholar who keeps losing memory because of Alzheimer's. If you are a movie buff this is a must watch! Summary:&gt;Astu might have a disorder like Alzheimer's at its centre but the film is much more than just that. It is a scholar's struggle to recall his memories, a daughter's struggle to find her missing father and her recollection of happier times, the scholar's relation with the elephant and his affection towards Chanamma. The depiction of Shastri's state of mind is as realistic as it can get and there is no exaggeration there. The casting is an integral part of this film as each character suits there roles to the T. Iravati Harshe as the troubled daughter, Amruta Subhash as the caring mother of two and Milind Soman as the concerned husband make this one a treat to watch.[Source](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/marathi/movie-reviews/Astu-Sunil-Mohan-Agashe-Iravati-Harshe-Milind-Soman-Amruta-Subhash/movie-review/39422629.cms)Although I personally liked the side role of Chanamma by Amruta Subhash more. I mean Mohan Agashe was great and he's the central character but Amrtua's role was something else altogether. Easily on par with any oscar winning role I'll say.**P.S.**: The movie had subtitles too. So I'll say non Marathi folks should go watch it too.

1a0xmr	-54915	1362928868	DeadSpace	 "Help me terminator, kill all of the necromorphs!"	An earlier post on this Reddit got me wondering.The resource bots in dead space don't get attacked by necromorphs. At all. Despite the fact that they are constantly making notice and even shine light on feeders if deployed by them. This leads to the implication that necromorphs only kill to support convergence, they NEED organic tissue and organic tissue only.So why don't humans just use robots to fight the necromorphs? I'm mainly talking about Tideman in dead space 2(the ONLY group of people who new about necromorphs BEFORE suffering an outbreak). They should already be using robots for mining. The advantages are overwhelming:- No need for constant time spent in the vacuum of space or planets like Tau Volantis, where the environment is hard on humans.- No Feeders or are least less of them! More rations for the robot managers!- A better method for deep space explorations (robots don't need to be put in stasis to pass time while traveling in deep space).- A faster and more detailed report about what happens during a necromorph outbreak as robots will be ignored. Therefore supporting any attempts to regain control of an outbreak.- Robots can be programmed to only attack dead tissue that has been reanimated(robot sees dead person moving? RIP HIS ARMS OFF!)- Did I say less feeders?And yes, this is my first post. 
1bbwdw	-54915	1364688252	DeadSpace	No dementia in DS3. (All spoilers)	One of the things that people seem to be having issues over in DS3 is the face that other than Carver almost all characters seem to be not having dementia. I'm here to clear this up.I believe the main reason for this is the alien machine. The machine seems to do more than just freeze the planet. After considering much of how it works in Dead Space 3 it seems to have the ability to also negate the marker signal. This could be why Danic had trouble finding the planet. He could have just traced the marker signal while destroying earth gov. Another price of evidence to this fact was that Carver was exposed to a marker signal before coming to Tau Volantis. Know I know that there are some contradictory facts to this. But its really the only way to explain why certain characters seem to just not be having any dementia. The only other explanations are that the markers left them alone because they were going to turn off the alien machine. But, that ignores the fact that Carver has dementia. 
1bc0bz	-54915	1364691984	DeadSpace	Combat tips for Dead Space 3 noobs.	Here are some things that I think will help new players of DS3. From vets of the series to new players overall:• Respect every aspect of stasis:     Veterans of Dead Space understand me when I say that stasis has been nerfed. And its been nerfed HARD. But this does not mean u can ignore it and have a easy time with the game. ALL necrosis except for exploders(yellow arms) and lurkers(three tentacle heads) immediately charge you in this game. Having an unlimited means of slowing them down is invaluable. You can increase its effect by using it on more than once on enemies or aka "stacking" it. This gives it the same power as earlier Dead space games. On a more advanced note ALWAYS shoot it at a necros feet instead of its body. This helps with the splash effect it has and prevents missing altogether. Respect your stasis and win the game.• Almost all of the "tools" have been nerfed in favor of the "weapons":Obviously an effect of EA's producers (it seems an attempt to coddle new players). This is most noticeable with the plasma cutter and line gun. The PC even sounds less lethal than other games. This being said it still pays off to dismember enemies instead of just shooting them and the tools make that much easier. So do not rely on ammo eating military engines if you are new.• Rely less on shooting necromorphs with their own limbs:The act of shooting dismembered limbs is a great way to save ammo, but due to the fact that all necros charge you now it is much much much more risky. Using stasis first is strongly advised but not necessary for better players. I remember in DS2 I was able to shoot off limbs and catch them in the air to shoot before necromorphs could even recover from flinching. Sadly, this is much more difficult even early in the game with a strong planet cracker.• IMMEDIATELY make a blueprint for the planet cracker!!!For some reason in my game if I remove the rotator from the Planet cracker I cannot put another one on. So just make a blue print of it if you mean to experiment. Oddly this does not happen with other free guns like the negotiator.• Scavanger bots runs are always worth it:Never neglect your scav bots. They gather plenty of tungsten(the hardest material to find in the game) and bring you the very important ration seals for free DLC items. Better player might become jaded with them, but they are a great means to get overclocked parts early.• If u pan on dodge rolling. Make it a habit and master it:In DS3 you do not flinch when hit by lighter attacks while rolling, but you still take damage. This means that DRing will still get you out of a tight spot but will come at a price. This also means you MUST decide early or you will take damage. That being said rolling is something that Dead space has always needed due to the fact that u do not begin running at full speed. Timing is key.• Make weapons that compliment the alt fire:This was implied in DS2 with the pulse rifles new alt fire grenade launcher. A good example is using the ripper to give the contact bean a safer charge. Be smart and creative.• Lastly, do not forget long range weapons:Since the nerfing of stasis and weapons like the line gun have come it is almost imperative that you have a weapon that shoots fast rounds. For clarity I mean a gun that has bullets that travel quickly through the air and shoot immediately after pulling the trigger. This rules out guns like the ripper alt fire, bolas, and line gun. The reason is that certain bosses require you to shoot soft spots while constantly moving, making slow shooting guns easily dodgeable. Do not let the telemetry spike fool u. It is slow.And that's it! Feel free to give advice in the comments.

Oddly this does not happen with other free guns like the Negotiator. • Scavanger bots runs are always worth it: Never neglect your scav bots. They gather plenty of tungsten(the hardest material to find in the game) and bring you the very important ration seals for free DLC items. Better players might become jaded with them or shun the micro transactions, but they are a great means to get overclocked parts early. You are going to get them anyway.• If u pan on dodge rolling. Make it a habit and master it: In DS3 you do not flinch when hit by lighter attacks while rolling, but you still take damage. This means that DRing will still get you out of a tight spot but will come at a price. This also means that you MUST decide on it early or you will take damage. That being said rolling is something that Dead Space has always needed due to the fact that u do not begin running at full speed. Timing is key. • Make weapons that compliment the alt fire and vice versa: I believe this was implied in DS2 by Visceral with the new Force Gun alt fire. A good example is using the Ripper to give the Contact Bean safer charging time while it floats in front of you. Be smart and creative. • Lastly, do not forget long range weapons: Since the nerfing of stasis and weapons like the Line Gun have come it is almost imperative that you have a weapon that shoots fast rounds. For clarity I mean a gun that has bullets that travel quickly through the air and shoot immediately after pulling the trigger. This rules out guns like the Ripper alt fire, Bolas weapons, and Line Gun. The reason is that certain bosses require you to shoot soft spots while constantly moving, making slow shooting guns easily dodgeable. Do not let the telemetry spike fool you. They are slow!And that's it! Feel free to give advice in the comments.

1br5lw	-54915	1365191416	DeadSpace	Starting a Hardcore run, looking for partners	I am beginning a hardcore run through DS3. Just looking for some skilled players. But there are rules:1. No OP guns like the Devil Horns2. You must start fresh like me. So no previous play through health and weapons.3. You must have a mic for better communication.4. I am in charge. Which means you'll be following my calls such as whether or not well be doing a side mission or scav not run. Of course, this does not apply to your own equipment or whether you want to put down a scav not or not. I just want a real coop challenge.PSN: PZvv

1irg8k	-54915	1374432013	AndroidUsers	Why do you want a 1080p display on a 5 inch phone?	I mean cmon, were all Android users here. We should not be this gullible. All 1080p displays are doing nothing for you unless you own an S4. In which case all the higher 400+ PPI does for you is use brute force to fix the pentile displays pixelation. On an IPS or TFT display you're just getting dooped into buying a phone that's gonna put more stress on the proc and the battery for absolutely no reason! This is the case whether you display is 4 inches or 5 inches. 1080p is becoming a label for sheep to throw $ at. Unless you're a Eagle you're not gonna notice.Look at iPhone 5 users. The device has a better looks than almost every 2013 Android flagship and comes with, you guessed it, a 720p display. This alone is proof that you are being screwed hard by your manufacturer. As long as a display surpasses 306+ PPI you need to stop worrying about more useless pixels start worrying about the real things that matter like color saturation, black levels, and viewing angles.TL;DR The 1080p resolution race is worse than the megapixel camera race because it makes you people want something that does nothing for you. All it does is put strain on the processor and battery life for nothing in return. Don't be stupid you're an r/Android user on Reddit you're supposed to be smart!http://www.slashgear.com/1080p-smartphone-displays-offer-no-visual-difference-over-720p-19252929/This link should help explain things a bit.

1jm9b4	-54915	1375517750	jobs	Looking for a job and I need it within the next 2 months.	I am 23 years old and I had to leave college for financial reasons. My previous work experience mostly stems from working with other people who were hired by my folks and I worked under the table for them for a few years. The work wasn't mostly difficult but I do think I learned a lot from it. It mostly consisted of managing their office as well as some experience with telemarketing and shadowing my dad during his home security installations. Near the end of my time while working with my parents, which was roughly 3 years, I did a lot of inventory management for her real estate company and even drove to some of her vacant houses to install lockboxes for her and stuff. Now here's the problem. I've been out of work for almost a year now and my folks have seem to be pretty pissed about it. They want me to go to a bunch of different schools like Heald college to find a fast education and get a career going. I said I need to find a job first but I have been having absolutely no luck in finding work even at some fast food joints! This is getting to the point where I'm starting to panic because my car was stolen a while back and I can't even gather enough cash to get like a cheap Honda civic. My folks are gonna throw me out soon and I need to at least have some cash saved up from work when that happens.I have a lot of skills that would make me a good team member for even a shift at a burger King. It does not matter what I do ad long as I find something that can work. If I pay my folks rent I could talk them into letting me stay while I go to a JC part time for a long term career in IT. I live in Stockton CA and finding jobs here seems to be getting harder by the day and I have been looking for like 5 months now. Wats the best possible path to finding a job and finding one fast before I'm homeless or moving into my grandparents house? Please I need your help guys I just want to be an average guy who can get by without making his parents feel ashamed.

It seems that there is usually a females only section during such lives but today there was no such section. I think this is a serious matter that management should address at tomorrow's live, and also lay down rules to prevent such cases from happening again (e.g expulsion from fan club and permanent ban from all concerts if caught in addition to making it a police case).A female section is definitely required imo for such concerts, especially when the crowd can get rowdy and in some cases females will get groped even if unintentionally.

But could they pull it off live?If you've been anywhere near the internet over the past year you'll no doubt have heard of Babymetal. If not, here's a quick summation: three teenage girls fronting a very technical metal band. Sounds good, right?That being said, clickbait articles and crazy YouTube videos are one thing but this is a Sonisphere crowd full of Iron Maiden fans who love nothing more than heavy metal and throwing horns. And it appears that's what Babymetal are about too. Opening the set on a video parodying the iconic Star Wars intro, the folklore of the band was revealed with the Legend Of The Fox God and the Metal Resistance that started in Japan. Babymetal are that resistance...Whatever your opinion on J-pop, you cannot deny the talent from the actual musicians on stage. Chugging riffs, widdly guitar solos, exquisite drum fills and nothing but energy. Of course the focal point is the tightly choreographed trio of Kawaii metallers running around the Sonisphere main stage with Cheshire cat smiles and constant horn throwing - despite altering it to slightly look like a fox.YouTube smash hit Gimme Chocolate of course receives loud cheers and even a singalong from the dedicated down front, but today it was much more about curiosity. This is Babymetal's first ever UK show so it's pretty much a given that over 90% of Knebworth has never seen them live before. And the crowd loved it.Pits were opening, horns were being thrown and not one bottle of piss was angrily hurled through the air. The songs might not be the eargasms the band would like, but the fun rating is through the roof with even grown men in Carcass t-shirts having a boogie.Whether they'll stay around for long is up for debate, but for half an hour on a Saturday Babymetal made the impact they needed.rating : 6/10

1qhdf2	-54928	1384289603	denvernuggets	Is it time to curb negativity on the Nuggets?.... or....	In perspective, the Nuggets lost in the last minute against an emotional Sacramento team on opening night, blew a late 4th quarter lead against a VERY good Spurs team, and have scored 100+ points the last three game (going 2-1 with the loss to the 4-2 Suns). Granted, Denver hasn't looked good, but Coach Shaw is still figuring things out. I think McGee's injury is a blessing in disguise, unfortunately the Nuggets look better without him. Chandler is coming back tomorrow and Gallo could stay healthy... Nahh jk, but you get what I'm saying. Things are still being figured out. But I guess what might be more depressing is the fact that we will be better but not good enough. Always stuck in mediocrity. *sighh*... The life of a Nuggets fan.TLDR: Is Denver on the upswing after a teething process? Or does that even matter? Because we'll just be stuck in the middle like always.

1s25ra	-54928	1386136894	DunderMifflin	Was an Angela and Roy coupling ever a part of The Office's future?	I've been rewatching The Office from start to finish (for literally the 40th time) and I'm finally going to ask something I've questioned for a long time.In the episode "The Fire" in Season 2, while the group is playing "Who would you do?" Roy suggests he'd "do" Angela.In the episode "The Secret" in Season 2 Angela confidently and quickly asserts she would rather be with Roy rather than Jim. And the episode that really puts this pairing into light is in "Branch Closing", Season 3, where SEVERAL extra scenes taken out of the original 20min episode show Angela clearly hitting on Roy and Kevin giving her a hard time about. Sorry I can't find a link. The extended version is on Netflix though.So my question is, was this coupling ever a possible storyline? Or just some weird dynamic the writers inserted from time to time in early episodes before dropping it completely? Someone may have mentioned it and I may have just never seen it before.

1saxov	-54928	1386398684	denvernuggets	Did the Nuggets need these last two games?	I know it's super cliche to say, but maybe the Nuggets needed these last two atrocious games. Let's be honest, everyone (extremely prematurely) wrote them off after the first 5 games. Then they had a 9-2 run. Maybe they were getting ahead of themselves? Denver has dropped two games they should win. Sounds cheesy but I loved this whole Brian Shaw not coming into the locker room at halftime. Maybe I'm being too much of a romantic sports fan but hopefully the Nuggets will have a more killer instinct from now?

1w99lo	-54928	1390800122	denvernuggets	Question: Mozgov or Koufos?	I've always been a big believer in Mozzy. I felt like he was more solid, and well rounded as an athlete compared to Koufos. Although Koufos was often applauded by the media for his advanced stats, like PER, Mozzy has been putting up better number this season with less minutes and it also a much better rim protector. The Nuggets were slammed for trading Koufos, but I feel like Mozgov is the better choice. What about you?

The price and awesome reviews of the Nexus 7 are making it an attractive choice but I already have a nexus with a 4.65 inch screen so I dont know how much of a benefit 7inches would be over that screen, which makes me think the Infinity is a better choice.

Currently I have a blog set up on blogger, and I'm interested in adding some functionality that requires a server side program. I've created a *very* simple tool that converts very basic Oracle SQL into the ANSI equivalent, but the tool is written in D and needs to be run on a linux machine. My plan was to set up the program on some hosted service and to use some ajax to send the SQL text from my blog to the service for conversion, but I'm not sure that's the best way to go about doing this.What would /r/webhosting recommend I do in this situation?  I don't need a detailed description just some helpful tips. Also, any links to helpful websites would be greatly appreciated.Edit:  More specifically, I'm trying to determine if it's worth setting up a hosted service, or if there is an easier way than going through that trouble.  If there isn't, are there any hosting companies that have simple ubuntu based vms for lease?

Each month we pay of x amount of each loan for 10 year. Current some loans have had interest accumulating during college, and needs to be payed off before we can start paying the principle. I am looking for a calculator that will allow me to determine how much we would save by paying off all of the accumulated interest in one payment up front vs just making second payments in addition to our monthly payment. Any suggestions?
ilh40	-54955	1310283477	tipofmytongue	I'm trying to remember a name of a movie!!	I'm trying to remember a name of a movie but all I can remember are vague details. It was definitely a cartoon, and there was a ship. I think it was a space ship and it was brown and kind of rounded. I think the main character was a white guy and he had baggy pants maybe? There was definitely a female and a lot of other people. And one thing I remember was an alien guy, and he was smart and helped with some sort of holograph thing.

As the title says I am looking for help on finding a recommendable CPU cooler for an old [Asus A8N-VM](http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/AMD_Socket_939/A8NVM/).This is a 939 Socket.The problem being that the cooling fins of the onboard GPU are rather close to the socket - as can be seen on the ASUS homepage I linked.I got a [Scythe KATANA 3 SCKTN-3000A](http://www.scythe-eu.com/en/products/cpu-cooler/katana-3-type-a.html), but it turns out the locking mechanism for the cooler could not be used witout damaging said cooling fins of the onboard GPU.So could anyone please recommend me a CPU cooler for this specific mainboard that will actually fit and be as quiet as possible?

2zfrrg	-54963	1426655187	heroesofthestorm	Betas are for feedback - right? So here is my feedback: Your matchmaking fucking sucks	I came in with the first or second invite wave, can't quite remember, but it was pretty early.Played a lot, spend a lot of money.I think the game is great, I think it has a ton of potential, I think you should hire someone who codes your matchmaking, or just get the guy who did it for months to come back and fix the mess.Your matchmaking sucks. Hard.I have hundreds of games played, and I end up playing with people who haven't even unlocked all the talents for their heroes. In my last game one guy had 7 games overall, two others were around 30. Not to mention we were only assassins and specialists, playing against a team that had BW as support and stitches as an engager. I also had the feeling they weren't as inexpirenced as our team, judging from their coordination, movement, decision making, but also from them having 4 elite skins and 1 shop + custom color.It has nothing to do with the size of the player base. It wasn't that bad for a long time. Actually it started to be this terrible around the buy-ins, where it should have gotten better due to more players.The devs have all the data they can ask for. Games played, level of the heroes, level of the accounts, damage done, healing done, highest rank ever achived, the comps before the games start, and so on.You can't seriousely tell us this is the best you can do, especially considering it didn't suck this bad for months.I am not the most competetive player ever. I don't care about my win ratio, I don't care if my team won or lost for the most part. Yes, I will try to win, but at the end of the day, I want some fun.I have no fun if my team gets stomped into the ground or we trample the other team 5 levels ahead with 100 skull golem pushs all the time. That is not fun at all.Please fix your matchmaking, it is the only really terrible part of a game that seems otherwise great and hopefully has a bright future.Also I did read the text, so here is a &lt;3 for you.Guess people talk about matchmaking here, but at least there was nothing in the near new section. Also as long as they don't fix it, I firmly believe we should keep bringing it up so they see it is still a problem, and we still want it fixed.
39380m	-54963	1433804053	heroesofthestorm	Give us a surrender option...	...or stay consistent with your design philosophy and give as and AFK / Threw the game reporting option and actually hand out bans/punishments for this kind of behaviour.This game is a team game. It is just how it works. It is hard to  impossible to compensate one player missing, it is flat out impossible to compensate 2+.Since HoTS went live, I have had it a couple of times already that people just throw the game, idle in the base, or auto attack some creeps here and there. I just played a game where Hammer and Uther decided the game was lost and they "didn't want to drag a bad game out" because our Kel'Thas got killed a couple of times something like 5 minutes into the game.They then proceeded to elaborate how bad he is and why they did not bother to play anymore in the chat until we lost.So either give us the option to surrender, or actually do something about this kind of behaviour, starting with report options for it.

But oddly, I unlocked the Gold Mastery for the SMAW and the RPG, which I never use, and a couple other titles that pertain to game modes I do not play. Has this happened to anyone else before?

2n05nv	-54983	1416593097	jumpshotporn	Wish this sub had taken off, I wanna share a few of my personal favorite jumpshots	I've always taken an deep look into how most players take their jumpshots, and I like to imitate them while I shoot as closely as possible. So without further adieu, here's my favorite jumpshots:1. Has to be **Michael Jordan**. As seen here, his midrange shot was unbeatable and unbelievably [smooth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfSftZvpHJg#t=102), also seen here in this [gif](http://images.rapgenius.com/a166a4dcc909727f0a429ad67bd70faa.450x241x133.gif) thats been posted here before1. **Kobe Bryant** (credit to /u/MrGabeFonseca) this [video](http://instagram.com/p/t9WP7MN9R6/) shows the base of what I love about Kobe's shot. He quite literally floats in mid-air, and gets the perfect amount of push for a gorgeous arc (is it getting hot in here?)1. I'm a full-hearted Blazers fan, but **Troy Daniels** has the most simple, and smooth [release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMQw3sqCy6U). He's fundamental to the dot. Great shooters have one, smooth, upward rising motion, and as seen in that video, he got it all.1. **Shabazz Napier** and his leg-flailing jumpshot is more of an acquired taste to like, but I [love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Eq7BScjLv8#t=25) it!1. **LeBron James** has the absolute definition of a "man-shot", like you see him take [this shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7kkbpcgXI8&amp;list=PL4C7WTiEpl8Uam9s4Q2wwS_klOyBM4OOk#t=76) and say "damn, that's a man's shot". LeBron is so powerful, and it's beautiful to watch him take jumpshots that are graceful. But honestly, he could put up 35 a game if he just put his head down and       attacked the paint every game instead of settling for some jumpshots. 1. **Andre Iguodala**. Not the best [shooter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9CtH0vGysE), but I love the arc and lift he gets on his shot1. **Joakim Noah!!** I love all shooting forms, ugly or sexy alike. Jo's is ugly as all hell, but it's endearing to watch him [spot-up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRiGgbBPP4E#t=40) and quite literally embarrass his opponents. Jo's shot is that one homely girl you know that has an amazing personality* And for everyone else, some of my other favorite shots include Dirk, Ray-Ray, Derek Fisher, Paul Pierce, Joe Johnson, Lamarcus Aldridge, Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili, Deron Williams, Evan Turner, Rudy Gay, Kevin Durant, Monta Ellis, Melo and Jamal Crawford

wpbuh	-54992	1342536914	clusterheads	Going Drug Free	So I've had these headaches for about 8 years, and get them every two years for about a month each time. I've been lucky, but I'm about a week and a half into a cluster right now.In the past, I've been put on verapamil to get out of the cluster and imitrex to treat the acute pain of the headache. While Imitrex does relieve the pain, it takes a half hour to kick in, and it leaves me groggy and slow for the rest of the day. This time around, I have decided not to use either drug. I'm going to let it run its course.I have found that meditation relieves the pain more quickly, and more effectively than Imitrex and I don't feel like shit for the rest of the day. The only downside is that I need to be in the position to isolate myself and concentrate at the onset. If you haven't tried this, give it a shot, it might work for you as well.Meditation works to get rid of the acute headache; however, I have not tried letting the cluster run its course without using verapamil to get out of it. Has anyone tried this? I would like to hear from others if it is worth my time to wait it out, or if I should just go to the doctor now and save myself some pain down the line.Thanks for your advice in advance.EDIT: By drug free, I mean prescription drug free. I'm open to LSD, shrooms, etc, if this kind of thing has helped others break cycle.

208a92	-55009	1394633656	trees	Enjoyed trees with my brother for his first time. My thoughts.	As the title may suggest, I am a habitual user. Wake n Bake is my normal routine... anyway my brother enrolled at the same university I am currently attending, and it has given us the opportunity to hang out and get to know each other better. He lived with my father, who split with my mother long before I was cognizant and so I did not get to know him very well. He enrolled as a criminology major, and so I was very wary of letting him in on my less than legal activities.Months go by and we have been able to get to know each other better, and I feel that I can trust him. He came over one evening to stay the night, and I said "Hey man, so I smoke weed... blah bblah," trying to defend and explain myself. He mentions that he smoked for the first time just last week but he didn't feel much. He says he doesn't care at all, actually he'd kinda like to try it again. I was stoked! We smoked a few one hitters from the bong (my favorite personally), and I could tell it hit him hard. We're just chillin watching TV and he gets on his phone, only for a minute or so. He suddenly looks at me and says, "dude, if I pay attention to something hard enough.. I can make everything else disappear. It's only real if I think about it!" I'm fucking rollin at this point, recalling my first time being stoned like that. All night he is just saying the funniest shit about his perception of the world, it just really made me appreciate the opportunity.After that I made some biscuits and gravy (cause who doesn't like breakfast for dinner) and he proceeded to tell me "those were quite possibly the best things I've ever eaten in my entire life." Not sure how true that was but nonetheless it made me happy to be able to do that for him.Wrap up: I just wanted to talk about that, if anyone has similar stories i'd love to hear them!TL;DR: Smoked out my brother. Got him 9/10. Made premuim biscuits and gravy. It was a good ole time.

20ms10	-55009	1395068208	bonnaroo	To bite the bullet, or go it alone	Hello Bonnaroovian's,  I had a pleasure of going to Roo last year for the first time, and it was just a fantastic experience. My first week back home after Roo, it was all I could think about. The atmosophere, the music, hell I even dreamt of the porta potty's! I knew I had to come back this year.  Last year I went without my significant other, and she was fine with that; she isn't very thrilled by camping and heat. After coming back, she could she the roo sparkle in my eye, and expressed interest in coming this year. I was excited to share this wonderful experience with her, but as the months passed I started to think about the conditions of TN in the middle of June.. though I found it tolerable I really began to doubt her ability to cope with it. I also thought about the eating and watering uptake needed for the festival, neither of which she is very good about during normal situations...  I did not bring my hesitations up with her, but we had come to an agreement last year that we would split the cost 50/50, as we try to do with living expenses (We have been living together for 3 years). She approached me yesterday saying that she wouldn't be able to pay for Bonnaroo, and so I should probably just go without her again. I was upset that she couldn't go but deep down I could not help but feel a tremendous relief... The freedom to lose my 'self' for that weekend is something that I don't know would be possible with her there, and depending on me. Though I feel relief I cannot help but feel guilt for just having purchased a ticket for myself, and not getting one for her too. That being said, if she is not willing to work hard and save her money for this I don't think she really has the WANT to experience Roo in the same way I did. So yeah that's pretty much it I just needed to get that off my chest.Does anyone have a similar story for paying a significant other's way to Roo? How was it?  TL;DR- S/O not willing to pay for tix, so I bought one for myself. I feel tremendous relief and guilt. Wondering what I should do.

26lpxw	-55009	1401196957	electronic_cigarette	Recent posts discussing non-nicotine substances being used with ecigs.	I scan /r/drugs, and recently there have been a variety of posts concerning different ways of using these vaporizing tools. To be honest, I am worried by this as i feel that ecigs are getting enough bad press at the moment. I am unsure how that rest of you feel about this.. What can be done? EDIT: It would appear nobody gives a shit, and posing concern is a waste of time. Good job everyone, good talk. 
28dj66	-55009	1403019348	bonnaroo	Of course the music was good, but what really blew my mind this year was...	THE FOOD. Holy shit, every single thing I ate this year was **on point**. The spicy pie, cuban tamales, and the pulled pork! My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it... And don't even get me started on those smoothies and fresh lemonade. I had a fantastic roo, in terms of music, but seriously the food was just tooo good. Oh and I totally forgot about the xango! deep fried cheesecake is too good to even put into words. RADIATE POSITIVITY and can't wait to see you all again next year!  What was your favorite thing to eat?

1kh9so	-55014	1376646116	SteamGameSwap	[H] (see comments) [W] Torchlight 2!	Aside from a few random, probably invaluable TF2 items, some trading cards, and Secret of the Magic Crystal - I don't have any games in my inventory *right now*. **However** I thought that, rather than simply buying a copy of Torchlight 2 for myself, I'd see what kinds of games (within reason) people would be interesting in trading for it - and buy that instead!So, what would you exchange your copy of TL2 for? First in best dressed, I guess!EDIT: Thanks /u/CrossedZebra!

1l19qz	-55014	1377395564	buildapcforme	$1000 gaming rig?	**What will you be doing with this PC?**Gaming, primarily. I'd like to be able to run "high-end" like Bioshock Infinite, Skyrim, Tomb Raider, and Assassins Creed 3, but also stuff like Torchlight, Bastion, etc.I'd also like to be able to capture and upload or possibly even stream gameplay to Youtube - as well as regular computing stuff, like internet browsing, watching movies, and listening to music.**What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?**$1000? Maybe a little over if necessary?**When do you plan on building/buying the PC?**ASAP.**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget?**Tower, OS, ~~monitor, speakers, keyboard, mouse,~~ wifi adapter, and so on.**Which country will you be purchasing the parts in?**Australia. I intend on ordering parts online though.**If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing?**Being my first build, I have no existing/used parts.**Will you be overclocking?**If it increases performance, then sure?**If there are any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them:**Due to my immense dislike for Windows 8, Windows 7 Ultimate is a *must*. **Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low noise components?**Some blue or red LED's would be cool if the budget allows for them, otherwise I'm not fussed. Noise isn't too big of a problem either.**Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?**N/AEDIT: Removed peripherals (monitor, speakers, keyboard and mouse) from build requirements.

I'd like to be able to run higher end games like Bioshock Infinite, Far Cry 3, etc.**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** $1000 Australian dollars. (possibly a little more if necessary)**When do you plan on building/buying the PC?**Within the next couple of weeks.**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget?** Tower and OS. I've already got my peripherals sorted.**Which country will you be purchasing the parts in?** I live in Australia, and I intend on ordering parts from PC Case Gear.**If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** Aside from monitor, mouse and keyboard - I don't have any existing parts.**Will you be overclocking?** I don't know? Would that be beneficial to me?  **Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build?**I'd like to run an SSD as well as a larger hard drive for storage, if possible.**Do you have any specific case preferences, or a particular color theme preference for the components?**I really like the Fractal Design cases - specifically Define R4 Black Pearl. Something like that would be cool. I'm into minimalistic black and/or grey cases.**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**Yes - and Windows 8.1 is fine. That's cheaper, right?

The topic was of this telephone number that was set up to record confessions. Basicly you whould call in and record a confession... Later on in the show they played a few of these recordings one in piticular was very creepy . A guy calls in telling a story from when he was 4 or 5  years of age he said at the time he was watching a cartoon where one of the charicters was sufficating and turning blue. Intrigued by this he went into his little brothers room his brother mind you was just an infant and he placed a plastic bag over his head to see if he would turn blue . After some minutes and nothing happening he took the bag off and noticed i guess his brother laying very still . He went back to his room and later that morning his parents later found his little brother dead he said he never told them what happend and the Docters thought it was Sudden infant death syndrome .The poor guy begans to weep near the end saying he has never told anyone about the incident that he was young and didnt know what he had done .Ive tried finding it but can't seem to locate the story or audio file maybe we can find it togeather i think it would make a great addition to this sub.

1ztkn0	-55024	1394212131	offmychest	I forgot my dog at the gas station .	I think writing about this might make it easier on me, I left my dog at the gas station 2 days ago .Here is how it happened. During late afternoon I decided to go to the gas station to grab some beer, the place is about 2 blocks from me .Now keep in mind I usually never take my dog  but, he needed to go for a walk anyway so i thought I'd kill 2 birds with one stoneArriving at the gas station, I had noticed  there was a tree out back whomever cut it left a 4 foot high stump so,  sorta like a hitching post I wrapped my dogs leash around it and set into the store .Whilst inside I remembered my wife needed a few things, I went to the ATM withdrew money grabbed her stuff and my beer and left to go home .I guess my brain went into routine mode since I rarely take my dog there.  sigh ...I walked home like I had done thousands of times before completely forgetting the dog  ! When i got home I cracked open a beer and sat in front of my PC looking for something to read, I did this for about a half hour . I eventually got bored of surfing the web and decided  that I was going to take a shower, when I glanced into my room, my bed was empty where the dog always lays. I Panicked THE DOG !!!!! I forgot the Dog my body began to shake in fear thoughts scanned through my head of all the worst case scenarios.What if the pound took him ? What if a concerned stranger called the police ? What will i say ?I quickly, in panic, found whatever cloths where laying on the floor put them on and ran. I ran so fast my lungs where burning .As i arrive ....relief ... he is still there but looking so lonely and confused it nearly breaks me down to tears .A man was sitting in a jeep near where I had the dog tied. he gets out .."Hey he asks ..is that your dog"? . Winded I muster yyea ."He looks hungry" this time gazing more sternly in my eyes.   I had no idea what to say ..."Yea he is always hungry"  I said to the stranger and faked a smile . My attention now turning towards my dog, I could see his furry brown eyes light up , tail wagging  ..I began talking to him as if he was human. "I'm sorry buddy ,I'm so sorry"  repeating myself over and over .I hadn't realized the guy in the jeep was still there, I guess after seeing my reaction to the dog his concerns faded. As I walked past, he rolled down his window and said "Thank You" and drove away .I am thinking that man was waiting there for some time, I wanted to thank him but,...sigh. my guilt stopped me . It's been two days now and I still feel really bad about it .I wonder what type of feelings he had whilst waiting there it tortures me to think of it . Thanks for letting me get this off my chest  .

It was 1984 and the day before Christmas I lay in bed a restless 10 year old waiting for a splinter of sunlight so i could go downstairs and open my presents.There i lay in my bed when all of a sudden Santa comes into my room "Shhhhh" he gestures with a single finger hovering vertically over his lips 'stay quiet' he wispers his breath reeking of Jack Daniels the huge bottle of it clutched in his other hand.He moves closer and wispers in my ear "hey boy you get a bonus this year" . Then Santa proceeds to blow me I remember everything his white beard rubbing against my balls His lack of teeth even waking up with my dick reeking of Jack(BOTH KINDS!)Recently my father passed away and i volunteered to help out my mother for she was moving to a smaller place.Anyway i was helping clean up the attic when by chance i came across a box next to the Christmas stuff labeled "box of shame " in it was an empty bottle of jack daniels a fake santa's beard, porno mags ,used condoms and a sticky picture of me bending over to open my Christmas presents.O my god I think my Dad sucked my cock !

Created on Hardcore, no special settings.Seed:  -6102845514928419793This one was a real winner for me.  Basically, every element I need to start an "easy" hardcore session was there on start.Spawn in a village of a small plains biome surrounded by river.  One end of the village has a small enchanted forest mini biome.  Nearby livestock are cows, sheep, horses, and chickens.Geographical stuff- nearby mineshaft, nearby surface lava, large rock face near with surface coal.  Spruce forest, flower forest, and regular forest all near.  Village is on a smooth plain and easy to pen in, flower forest mini biome is very close.It is possible to make tools, make a bed, kill cows for steak and sleep the first night in the village.  Essentially, this gives players new to hardcore mode some breathing space.

1wclbs	-55032	1390886101	SCP	[Discussion] Ever fall asleep reading the scp wiki? Here is my experience...	I've been reading the scp wiki every night lately to go to sleep.  I like horror, and reading the reports gives me enough repetitive activity to finally drift off.  I'm on scp-408 at this point.So, I drift off, and while I am sleeping, something in the dark is sidling up my face and whispering nightmare fuel into my ear.  The whispers get more intense, and so do the descriptions of unnamed horrors and graphic descriptions about gore and things waiting for me just out of reach in the dark.  At first, I am completely shocked into stillness, alone in the pitch black night, with this silky voice and the feathery touches against my ear and side of my head.Finally, I get fed up with all of the whispering about horrible things that go slither in the night.  I don't want to have nightmares, and then I realize that I am sleeping, and I'm worrying about having nightmares from something whispering into my ear.  My god, what the bleep is on my head!I wake up, and I feel it crawling around my ear, nuzzling my ear lobe and settling on my hair.  My arm is perched above it, but I can't seem to reach it.  This little horror is crawling around like some giant soft spider or crab, gently working its way around my ear, across my head and face.  Unfortunately, it was too dark for me to see it.  I finally wrench my arm down, and the whole squishy mess is shoved flat onto my ear.  I'm really freaking out now, because the last thing I need is a big spider bite on my face.  I pull my arm back, and the nameless thing comes undone from my skull and wriggles away.  Well, of course it came off.  I realized it was my hand.  My hand, in my sleep, was moving around like a spider on my skull, making like it was digging in my ear, whispering into it while I slept.  Had brief flashbacks to Army of Darkness, and had to do a quiet inventory in my mind of the contents of my garage- do I own a small chain saw?  A shotgun?  Good undeadbill, bad undeadbill, it doesn't matter, I'm the one with the possessed whispering spider hand…  I finally calm down enough to realize that it was my imagination, that the bathrobe on the closet door isn't the spider's master waiting to come take my silk bound nightmare memories, and I don't need to dropkick the closet or turn on the lights to look for more bugs to smash.Weirdest experience with a waking dream yet, all thanks to you wonderful people.  I mean, in this day and age, very few people actually experience real horror watching a movie or reading a book.  So, whoever has contributed to the wiki, you should feel proud of yourselves that your work is giving jaded grown men nightmares.  I'll be sure to write again if anything else odd happens.

1x7xhq	-55032	1391726384	Sacramento	Sacramento has a drought because LA didn't want one.	Controversial title, I know.  But if I am reading [this article rightly](http://newsle.com/article/0/120536792/), the reason Sacramento is having a drought is because our water was shipped down to LA to bolster their supplies- otherwise, we would have had three years' worth of water available to us.  Yes, LA gets a three year pass on water shortages at the expense of Sacramento.The craven desire of Federal and State officials to please LA may well lead to the collapse of our fisheries, our ag businesses and our way of life.  I probably wouldn't be so angry if I hadn't lived through the drought in the 70s, watching a very full peripheral canal making water deliveries so people in LA could keep their lawns green while we in Sacramento had to deal with brown lawns, reduced crop yields, and shower/bath restrictions.

368027	-55032	1431826234	Sacramento	Not everybody knocking is a JW...	Still thinking through all of this, but I had someone knock on my door who claimed that they narrowly escaped being kidnapped by the residents of a home a couple of blocks away.The victim didn't know the address.  I made sure the person was safe and had something to drink and snack on until the police could arrive.  The police took a statement and drove off, leaving the victim with me.  I got the person home and made sure they made it to a relative's home where they felt safer.The part that bothers me the most was that my home was the fourth door they tried where someone was home.  Nobody would even call the police for the victim, who was in obvious distress.  I can't imagine what might have happened if the victim had tried to go out on a more open street if the alleged perpetrators were looking for them.  Mostly I'm upset because I'm willing to do the minimum to help someone in need call the police, and that if it were my daughter or wife, who would have helped them?Anyways, keep your loved ones close, and try to remember that if someone really needs help, they won't mind if you call 911, even if you leave the door closed.

I always was more of a tomboy as a kid, and just recently cut my hair and started dressing more and more androgynous. However, I identified as a woman all my life and until recently thought I was just a butch female.A few months ago I thought about being a guy for the first time. I thought how nice it would be to have a male body, and to dress 100% male,...This thought kept on growing in my head and I started questioning my gender identity. I'm still not sure if I really want to go through a ftm transformation, but whenever I think about getting Tostosterone-Injections I feel really happy, whenever I think about growing a beard or about getting in shape and really muscular, my heart skips a beat.I don't really know what I should make of this, but I really wanted to share this with someone as I'm not able to talk to friends/family about this.

I'd only told a few people until now, and only ones that weren't close to my family because I'm so afraid of my parents finding out.My brother came home for the weekend and I sat down with him 10 minutes ago and I told him. It was so hard to get out at first, but he accepted it, and he hugged me and told me that if my parents were to throw me out I would always have a place to stay.I'm still shaking, but it went so smooth, he didn't even hesitate, he immediately told me that he loves me no matter what and started asking questions about transitioning and sexual preferences and the likes.I'm so happy right now

Also, I have them big ol' childbirth hips and all of that makes it really hard for me to find something. The problem is: I don't have too much money, so going to a tailor for pants is totally out of the picture.Do you guys have any advice for me on where I can get good trousers for my wide hips and any other tips in general for dressing classy as a big guy?

Well, I'm on spring break right now, and I really was looking forward to it, but today I woke up at 6:15 am realizing that I had gotten an unwanted visitor. I was doing so good over the last few days, I went out wearing a binder for the first time and I did some shopping (new shoes and the like), but now all of that is just set aback.I've been lying awake for 2 hours now, trying to get back to sleep, but I have the worst cramps I ever had. I even took some pain meds, but for some reason I didn't see any results yet which causes me to panic over whether my body got used to the meds. Uargh!Dysphoria is at a really high level, I was sitting on the loo crying for about an hour and I overall feel like shit. Not really looking for advice, just ranting, but if someone knows something, anything that helps them with cramps, please let me know 'cause I'm so done already.TL;DR: shark week is here, feeling like crapEdit: I just found this tumblr post, made me laughhttp://m.imgur.com/IZfv2ej
31egrv	-55035	1428133675	bigmenfashionadvice	Hello fellow Big Men	I'm new here. I've just come across this sub and I'm really happy that something likeit exists.About me: I'm Austrian, I'm 17 and I'm a ftm transguy. Meaning I was born a woman but always felt more like a man and am now in the progress of transitioning.I'm definitely a bigger dude. I weigh something around 250 lbs. To top that off, I also have a female fat distribution, so I've got huge hips, a huge butt and huge legs, which makes it hard for me to find fitting trousers :(Well, so that's me. Hello! *waves*
31ogmx	-55035	1428358504	Torchwood	Just rewatched Children of Earth	First time I saw it my english wasn't half as good as it is now, so I didn't get so many things.All I want to do is cry. I've never experienced this with any other TV Series, my body is physically aching. Watching Ianto die again, and watching Jack sacrificing his own grandson makes me want to cry, shout, and I really feel the urgent need to get a hug :(All the feelz...I forgot how good this show is. Oh god. I really hope they make a season 5 as soon as Barrowman is finished with Arrow, and I really hope it'll be set back in Cardiff where it (IMHO) belongs. Can someone please give me a hug *crawls into a corner with a blanket while bawling his eyes out*
31vizl	-55035	1428502630	doctorwho	Captain Jack meeting 12??	So I was wondering: if Capaldi were to stay the doctor for two more years or so, and Arrow was to finish during that time, there would be a realistic possibility of Captain Jack returning to Doctor Who.But what if Jack met Capaldi's Doctor. Wouldn't he freak out because John Frobisher was still alive....?

Well, today I ran into my dad there...I was so ashamed I just wanted to melt right then and there and vanish into the abyss of nothingness. I quickly came up with some excuse about how the womens restroom was full and I quickly snuck into the mens room, and I think he kinda bought it.He then proceeded to make a comment on how the people in there probably just thought I was transgender and everything inside of me screamed *"Tell him already!!!!!!!"*, but I chickened out and laughed it off. I really don't know how to do that shit anymore. However good I was feeling about myself at the moment, it all vanished and when looking in the mirror I just see a coward who'll never be able to come out of the closet.Sorry for the rant :(

On the other hand, I really need a restroom, and there are no gender neutral ones around.Edit: Just to clarify, I'm not a fan of mistreating anyone, no matter who they are and in which bathroom. The reason for me being happy is the fact that I apparently passed really good today.

19cgb2	-55037	1361994272	wedding	My mom is terminally ill and my wedding is in a few weeks	Hi everyone. I wanted to seek other brides' advice on my upcoming wedding and my mom's condition. Some background: My mother was diagnosed with stage four ovarian cancer in late 2009. Since then, she fought the disease hard until about a few weeks ago, when she was hospitalized and the decision was made to stop chemo because it was making things worse. The tumors have spread to her intestines, rendering her unable to digest food as one normally would. She had a stent placed in her stomach that would relieve the symptoms she was experiencing (pain, nausea, vomiting, etc.), but the reality is that after cancer has spread this much, and this procedure is done, her life expectancy is anywhere from 30 to 90 days.For the past few years, I have dealt with the reality that my mom would die from this disease at some point. I have come to terms with it in many respects and my mom and I have had conversations about the future, including whether she will be able to see me get married on April 13. She told me regardless of what happened, she wanted me to have my wedding as planned. She epitomizes the spirit of living life to the fullest and not letting cancer become this dark thing that engulfs you and depresses your spirit for life.However, the issue that arose yesterday involved my oldest brother and how he is coping. I had asked my two brothers months ago to get fitted for tuxedos, as I wanted them to be in the wedding party and walk our mother down the aisle, as I pray that she will make it to that day. One was fitted a few months ago, but when my fiance and I checked to see if everyone had been fitted (the deadline is today), I saw he had not gone. I sent him a text asking if he would do it. He replied, saying he would consider going tomorrow. I got upset and asked him to tell me if he was really going to do it because I was frustrated with him not being direct about it. I had asked him repeatedly for months, even before my mom became gravely ill.He called my sister crying, saying the last thing he had on his mind was the wedding and that he probably wouldn't go because he would rather be by my mother's side instead of pretending to have a good time. My mother is not bed ridden. The reality is she may be at some point, but I choose to be optimistic. If I have to carry her down the aisle myself in my arms, I will make sure she sees this wedding.Am I being selfish for being upset? I fear now he won't attend the wedding at all, regardless of the state of my mother or if she passes. I am starting to believe he wants me to cancel the whole thing. I think it would dishonor her and her wishes if I cancelled the wedding, or didn't proceed as planned. What is the best way to proceed? What should I say?Sorry this is so long. I just needed a release. A lot is going on right now.

I ask because I want to be a good contributor here.I blog and link it sometimes but it hasn't been received well.  My expertise is biblical studies, philosophy, and theology.

22lyjy	-55039	1397054296	Christianity	Rob Bell - has he gone too far?	I have always been for Rob Bell--his books, his blogs, and his ideas.  Many Christians gave up on him a long time ago, soon after the "Love Wins" promo video broke, but I continued to believe in him.  I believed in his passion and conviction to communicate the gospel.  Regardless of what many people think, he never committed heresy.  His beliefs removed him from evangelical circles but didn't removed him for the Christian tradition as a whole.  For many of us, younger evangelicals, he became a light of hope, so to speak.  He embodied the hope we have that someone could stand up to the "evangelical machine" and expose its over-reaching assumptions.However, now he has stopped me in my shoes.A couple weeks ago the news broke that Rob would be joining Oprah on her "The Life You Want" tour. (You can go to her website to investigate more.) Oprah says, "All of my life, I have wanted to lead people to an empathy space. To a gratitude space," and that, "I want us all to fulfill our greatest potential. To find our calling and summon the courage to live it."  The two day event will focus on Oprah's story and vision for life, Friday nights, and then welcomes "hand-picked 'life trailblazers,' each of whom brings a unique power to connect, dig deep and open hearts and minds."  Rob is one of four "life trailblazers" that takes the stage on day two of the event.  Rob confirmed, via his tumblr account, that he would be touring with Oprah starting in September.People who reading this probably fall into two camps.  (More like three probably.  Some people have like him in the past but worry he has stepped too far.  Maybe there is four, those who could care less.)  Either they have already dismissed Rob as an influential leader in Christianity, or they love Rob and want more Christians to think like him.  Those in the latter camp, I'm with you, but I worry that this step might be too far.  Thus far, Rob has always presented himself as a Christian leader.  After leaving Mars Hill Bible Church, he shifted his focus a bit, he started doing 2days with Rob Bell and CraftLab with Rob Bell, but he never appeared to only be a self-help/become successful type of guy.  Instead, it seemed like his focus shifted to helping others harness and use their talents through creativity and other avenues for the spread of the Gospel.Prior to now, Rob always pointed to the Gospel.  At times his message was mystical and encrypted, but it could be unsorted.  I fear that he has finally left the realm of Christian teaching to apply his ideas to strictly "spiritual" experiences.  It seems as if Oprah has had some sort of spiritual encounter that she wants to point others too, but it boils down to fulfilling your destiny and becoming the best person you can be.  Almost like some sort of secular prosperity Gospel.  I'm not discounting Rob, I'm just worried.   We don't know what he is going to speak about at these conferences, and I don't want to say that he can only teach Christians.  But I wonder if it is counter productive to the Gospel to be a Christian teacher and switch to motivational speaking.***Has Rob gone too far this time?  Maybe this is good because the Holy Spirit can work through Rob's message.  Maybe Rob is only speaking about creativity and using one's skills to the fullest.  If so, is that a message that contradicts the Gospel?
2e3ugo	-55039	1408560880	Christianity	We NEED to Care About Social Issues	I’m not the first voice to speak out on these issues.I’m **definitely** not the most qualified voice to speak out on these issues.However, I may be the first voice that YOU have heard speak out on these issues.If that is the case, then we have a problem… not just you, or me, but all of white, evangelical, Christian America. While we are living our busy lives, consumed with our own little world, people are being oppressed and few are watching.The most recent example of oppression occurred in Ferguson, Missouri. Where a young black man named Michael Brown was gunned down by a police officer because of his skin color. My reason for writing is not to talk more about Ferguson, there are many who are more qualified to comment. Here is a link to a friend’s [post](http://www.faithstreet.com/onfaith/2014/08/15/while-you-were-talking-about-gungor-driscoll-and-walsh/33704). He has compiled quite the list of people who can give you direct commentary from those directly involved in this situation. I encourage you become antiquated with what’s going on there.Oppression also came against a popular Christian musician and commentator [Vicky Beeching](http://vickybeeching.com/) this week. Vicky came out about being gay through an [article](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/vicky-beeching-star-of-the-christian-rock-scene-im-gay-god-loves-me-just-the-way-i-am-9667566.html) published by The Independent. I’ve seen numerous articles and posts discussing what this means for evangelical Christianity come across my news feed since her announcement. I’m sure that Vicky has already began to experience the backlash of her decision to be open about her sexuality. I encourage you to read the article, get to know Vicky and how her silence has affected her life for the past 35 years.**These are just two examples of oppression that those on the margin of society experience. Both occurred this week and were widely covered by the media. Yet, there are thousands who live under oppression every day, all over the world, and no one will ever bring their situations to light. Oppression, racism, and hatred are a very real thing, even in our 21st century world.****Further, the type of oppressors that I am talking about here aren’t the type you would expect. They aren’t the vocal people who openly speak out with hate towards those on the margin, the Donald Sterling types. No, I’m talking to people like you and me–the apathetic Christian, or church, that doesn’t say anything. Sometimes it isn’t that we don’t care, but that we have NO IDEA these things are taking place. Many times we aren’t even aware of the oppression happening in our own communities!**Earlier this week I wrote a blog called [A Christian Politic](https://chrishirschy.com/2014/08/13/a-christian-politic/). **In it I argued that a good start for a Christian politic is to care more about the people than the issues. I think this idea cuts deeply to the heart of our apathy towards the oppressed.****When did the church starting caring more about the issues than the people? When did we start buying into political propaganda and stop walking the streets to discover the true story? When did we become more comfortable acting with our votes and money than our souls?**I’m not writing this post to cause guilt or anger. I’m calling for an awakening–a social justice revolution–where we start to see those who are oppressed as more than issues or legislation, but as humans!It seems appropriate to end with these words from Jesus. (I don’t typically reference The Message but Eugene Peterson captures the thrust of this passage quite nicely, I think!)&gt;31-33 “When he finally arrives, blazing in beauty and all his angels with him, the Son of Man will take his place on his glorious throne. Then all the nations will be arranged before him and he will sort the people out, much as a shepherd sorts out sheep and goats, putting sheep to his right and goats to his left. 34-36 “Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Enter, you who are blessed by my Father! Take what’s coming to you in this kingdom. It’s been ready for you since the world’s foundation. And here’s why: I was hungry and you fed me, I was thirsty and you gave me a drink, I was homeless and you gave me a room, I was shivering and you gave me clothes, I was sick and you stopped to visit, I was in prison and you came to me.’ 37-40 “Then those ‘sheep’ are going to say, ‘Master, what are you talking about? When did we ever see you hungry and feed you, thirsty and give you a drink? And when did we ever see you sick or in prison and come to you?’ Then the King will say, ‘I’m telling the solemn truth: Whenever you did one of these things to someone overlooked or ignored, that was me—you did it to me.’ -Matthew 25:31-40 (MSG – emphasis added)*This piece originally appeared on my blog.

For the reason that art is often seen as subjective, it is rare to be able to watch yourself improve. Today I wish to motivate you by sharing my story and allowing you to see me progression.When I was 8 years old I started taking breakdance and Hip-Hop classes and I loved it. Sadly because I got bullied a bit in middle school I stopped dancing when I was 13. 3 years ago (I was around 16/17) I realized that that was really stupid and that I truly really loved dance. Sooo...I started dancing again and trained to the best of my ability in Hip-Hop Dance. As with anything when I started off I was pretty bad but hard work, studio time, and commitment has really paid off. For the reason that I love making videos, I recorded my progress.

l8sc5	-55072	1318370092	loseit	40 lbs down around 45 more to go at least	Well I started out at around 285 and my roommates several of which were around my weight all decided to lose weight to try to get in the military.  Needless to say they all started dropping weight and well I couldn't be the biggest guy in the house without a fight.About 4 months ago I started to cut soda and potatoes out of my diet.  I only cut about 5 lbs and then decided it was time to join a gym and get serious.  I started with the treadmill and the weight machines and got some progress.  I dropped down to 257 then stalled.  One of my roommates had been using reddit for a while and sucked me in.  A little over a month ago I started a 6 day a week program combining HIIT and SS.  I am now down to 244.5 as of last night and have way more energy and strength.Don't know how far my weight will go down but I am shooting for a fit body and will have it.  I just wanted to say thanks for the inspiration I get from the stories I see here and best of luck to everyone on your own journeys.  Oh and I just leapfrogged one of my roommates on Saturday and he had been going for quite a while on losing weight. Edit:  Here is a short progress snap shot the first is a float trip in June the second is from tonight [here](http://imgur.com/a/4qSLL)
lpq9k	-55072	1319640375	loseit	[NSV] belt changes and a rant	Ok to start with I had to change belts a while back to a smaller one I had gotten a while back and hadn't been able to wear for a while.  So today I have graduated to the 4th notch on that smaller belt that I hadn't been able to even wear a couple months ago.My stats for those who like those:  Male Height 5'10"  Starting Weight 285  Current Weight 244 Programs:  HIIT sprints currently doing 30/60 sec 8 intervals, Starting Strength, HIIT days also include inclined sit ups and crunches,  Swimming on all exercise days,  Exercise 6 days a week Thursdays offOk now the rant if you would like to stop here go ahead.So I have been working on my weight since June.  I started off by dropping soda and reducing my consumption of potatoes.  I also started trying to walk more often.  Around July I decided to get serious and join a gym.  I started off light and started walking on the treadmills and using the weight machines.  About 2 months ago I kicked up my routine thanks to r/Fitness to my current setup.  Over the first 3 months of starting this I have gone down 40 lbs.  However the last month.  I have been stuck at my current weight.  It is very annoying as I know I am losing as I am noticeably smaller my shrinking waist line is evident of this as is the fact that more and more people are noticing the changes.  I know logically I understand why my weight is not changing it's just aggravating as those I am working out with keep losing and I am just floating.  Oh well I will start going down again shortly I hope I just wanted to vent on this.

I don't think my pictures are helping any but I am in the middle of getting in shape and having troubles getting good photos.So other than my crappy photos how bad is the rest of my profile.

m0arj	-55072	1320416959	amiugly	Well I think I am going in the right direction finally [M/29]	I started going down hill a couple years ago.  I started a desk job that didn't involve moving around so I started gaining weight.  Here is a [pic](http://i.imgur.com/WSyfn.jpg) of where I was around a year in.  Around a year I gained a significant amount of weight.  I also started shaving my head as friends kept requesting I do so.  Here is a [pic](http://i.imgur.com/OXW09.jpg) of me and my dad from around this time.So it has been a little over 2 years from the first picture.  I started getting serious about my fitness around June and began eating better and working out.  I am currently around 242 lbs and have between 50 to 70 lbs i would like to lose still.  [Here is where I am at now.](http://i.imgur.com/5B9Av.jpg)So am I at least going in the right direction.
mg42x	-55072	1321564549	loseit	[GYM] Felt amazing when kid saw my squat weight and said he would never be able to do that.	So I have been doing a modified version of starting strength for a little over two months along with HIIT (sprint/stationary cycleing) 3 days a week on non-lifting days.  The last workout for last week was at 220 lbs for squat and was on my working set, when a father and son where being shown around the gym and the kid looked over and said he would never be able to do what we where doing.  I have to say this just felt amazing as the progression really didn't hit me that I had gone that far.  I just did my 235 lb set last night and being able to put just that little bit over 2 plates just makes me want to keep going.This was really motivating as I have been stuck around the low 240 lb range in my weight for the last month or so.  My body keeps changing and I am getting more noticeable muscle in my arms and legs but getting to milestones in my lifting really helps to see I am making serious changes.  
oo838	-55072	1327025019	BTFC	Intro:  29/M/5'10"/235lbs (Jan 19-April 12)	Ok to start I began taking fitness seriously in July of this year.  I started at 285 lbs and have already lost 50 lbs due to correcting my diet and steadily increasing my workouts.  I currently go to the gym 6 days a week with 3 days a week doing weight training and 3 days a week doing body weight training (Convict Conditioning).My current free weight training is structured off the Starting Strength program however I replaced power cleans with Pendlay rows due to my gym not having bumper plates.  My current diet is not too special.  I try to maintain a low calorie diet with plenty of protein.  I cut out potatoes and soda from my diet in the beginning and have maintained that.My current weights are:Barbell Squats: 160 lbs Barbell Bench Press: 110 lbs Barbell Deadlift: 155 lbs Barbell Standing Shoulder Press: 85 lbs Pendlay Row: 95 lbs (just started these this last week) Convict Conditioning Current sets: Kneeling push up: 2X15 Flat Knee Raise: 3X30 Jackknife Squat: 3X20 Horizontal Pulls: 2X10 (Still working on perfecting form on this one) My Fitocracy user name is [Zaydrachebd](http://www.fitocracy.com/profile/Zaydrachebd/)Pics:[Front](http://i.imgur.com/7DKoC.jpg) [Side](http://i.imgur.com/wWCmP.jpg) [Back](http://i.imgur.com/c7kd6.jpg) [Proof](http://i.imgur.com/yktkI.jpg) [If interested my before pic from June](http://i.imgur.com/UZZQj.jpg) My goals are to continue with the structure of SS and CC with increases in weights a 5 lbs per exercise with the exception of Deadlift which is 10 lbs.  CC I would like to be to stage 3 at least in all exercises except handstand and bridge which are waiting until all others are stage 6.  I stopped caring about the numbers on the scale and am mostly focused on how I look, feel, and my increasing strength.Edit for proof pic.Edit for spacing

This week has been 2x bench and deadlift and 1x shoulder press and rows.  Also reached my progression standard on flat knee raises.The biggest improvement came on Sunday when after my lifts I decided to run a local trail as the weather was ok.  I managed a 3.7 mile hike with a significant incline in 57 minutes.  Over all the week has featured sore muscles but a happy me.My current weights for those without fitocracy:Barbell Squats: 175 lbsBarbell Bench Press: 120 lbsBarbell Deadlift: 175 lbsBarbell Standing Shoulder Press: 90 lbsPendlay Row: 100 lbsConvict Conditioning Current sets:Kneeling push up: 2X20Flat Knee Raise: 3X35Jackknife Squat: 3X30Horizontal Pulls: 2X10 (Still working on perfecting form on this one)

r8gs7	-55072	1332430294	OkCupid	My body image is currently jacked.  Should I change what I have for body type or not.	Ok I have been using OkCupid for a while now and have been using the average body type on my profile for a while and am really coming to terms with how big I was to begin with.  I really should have been using the overweight but I really didn't see how big I had gotten.  Things changed in July of last year and I decided being fat was not for me anymore.  9 months later I am 55 lbs lighter and have significantly increased my strength.  Now I have a problem where I don't know how to see my body type.  I still have fat I want to lose and muscle I want to gain but my current shape I don't know how others view it.  It doesn't help that most people I ask just see how far I have gone so I just get the people noticing the weight lose but don't get real feedback.So this is where I am turning to the fine people here at r/OkCupid.  Should I change my body type to something other than average.Warning pictures of me without my shirt on.[album](http://imgur.com/a/VEAjQ)Edit:  Sorry for the confusion the title is referring to the fact that my ability to judge my body type is jacked.  I don't believe I am anywhere close to "Jacked" as a body type.Edit 2:  Looks like I am between overweight and average from what I am getting so far.  I will take the median of a little bit extra for now and keep plugging away.  Thanks for the feedback everyone.
runfg	-55072	1333636499	BTFC	[Update] Week 11 30/M/222lbs (Down 13) Birthday post	Well today is my 30th birthday.  When I turned 29 I was 285lbs and horribly out of shape.  Last Saturday I biked 15.8 miles, ran 2.4 miles and swam 400 meters on top of my CC workout for the day.  Unfortunately I had not adjusted to my new Vibram Fivefingers shoes and messed up my heels a bit.  Decided to take the week as a rest week as I got sick on Sunday as well.  I am currently ramping back up and will be returning to normal schedule on Saturday.I did switch from Starting Strength to 5/3/1 as I was no longer able to maintain the linear progression of Starting Strength and Deadlift was getting to a point where I was going to have to adjust the schedule anyway.  Current lifts areBarbell Squats: 240 lbs X6 rep on finalBarbell Bench Press: 145 lbs X8 rep on finalBarbell Deadlift: 270 lbs X6 on FinalBarbell Standing Shoulder Press: 115 lbs didn't get to hit this one on 5/3/1 last week because of the heel issue but will be hitting it this Sunday.Convict Conditioning Current sets:Half push up: 2X20Flat frog raise: 2X12Half Squat: 2X12Horizontal Pulls: 2X12 Finally got to the correct height on thisShort bridges: 3X50 completed progression standard will be moving to next stage on TuesdayWall Headstand: 110 secRunning went good until the heel thing.  Did my research afterwards and found out what I was doing wrong.  I will be resuming this on Saturday with HIIT 10 intervals of 30/30.I also added Swimming back in and try to swim 400 meters a day if possible.  I also bike with one of my friends on the weekend when it is nice and he isn't working.  The great news is my weight finally started dropping after being stuck on a plateau from mid December till my 8 week check in.  I am currently down to 222 lbs and that is down from 285 lbs that I started my weight loss at last June.  Also measured my waist at navel at 34 inches and my neck at 15.5 inches my height is realistically 5'10.5" but I usually just go with 5'10".Links:[Picture Album Current](http://imgur.com/a/nhIql)[Intro Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/BTFC/comments/oo838/intro_29m510235lbs_jan_19april_12/)[Week 4 Update](http://www.reddit.com/r/BTFC/comments/pt83g/update_week_4_29m230235/)[Week 8 Update](http://www.reddit.com/r/BTFC/comments/qyrjo/update_week_8_29m230_5ish/)[Fitocracy user name is Zaydrachebd](http://www.fitocracy.com/profile/Zaydrachebd/)
ruuca	-55072	1333644600	loseit	Well I just turned 30 and am in better shape now than I have been in my entire twenty's.	(Warning pictures of overweight guy without shirt contained with in)When I turned 29 I was 285 lbs and horribly out of shape. [Here I am with my dad December of 2010.](http://i.imgur.com/TSWd5.jpg?1)  I hadn't realized how bad I had gotten until June of 2011.  [It was mostly a pic from a float trip that opened my eyes.](http://i.imgur.com/UZZQj.jpg)  All of my roommates got to the point where they all started to lose weight and I got to the point where I was the heaviest guy in the house.  I decided this wasn't acceptable.In June I joined my local 24 Hour Fitness and started fixing my diet.  I started slow using the treadmill and machines at first and getting rid of soda and cutting back my fast food consumption.  I also tried to cut out potatoes from my diet as much as possible and switched to wheat bread as well.  By the time August came around I had gotten to the point where I could at least walk at 4.5 miles per hour for an hour with a good grade and had lost some weight but I decided to do some more research and learn to exercise correctly.I was pointed in the direction of reddit and particularly r/fitness to help me out.  I learned about Starting Strength and HIIT cardio and started to get serious about fitness.  [By october I had gotten better](http://i.imgur.com/ZLTwh.jpg), I had gained strength and endurance and had started to lose weight.  November started a new problem as my gym partner started flake out on me.I started Convict Conditioning to make up for having to drop lifting.  I got down to 235 around mid December.  When the new year started my gym partner figured out doing what he was doing wasn't helping at all and wanted to start lifting again.  We started back back on SS and I continued CC on off days.  At this point I was consistently going to the gym 6 days a week.  [January I also started the BTFC.](http://www.reddit.com/r/BTFC/comments/oo838/intro_29m510235lbs_jan_19april_12/)  So far in the challenge I have noticed shifts in my body composition but my weight has stayed rock steady at 235.  This was until around mid March when thanks to DLST fixing the lack of sun when I get off work allowing me to add running back in to the mix.  This week has been a rest week as I shifted my running to minimalist running thanks to my new Vibram Fivefinger shoes unfortunately my heel striking tendencies have caused my heels to not like me.  But my weight has been liking me recently as I have dropped down to 222 lbs.  [I posted an update in BTFC with my current lifts and some other info](http://www.reddit.com/r/BTFC/comments/runfg/update_week_11_30m222lbs_down_13_birthday_post/) [also here are my current album pics if you would rather just see those.](http://imgur.com/a/nhIql)  I still have about 25lbs I would like to lose and intend to greatly increase my strength, endurance and flexibility over the next couple of months.  I just changed over to the 5/3/1 program and will be doing that with CC as supplement training with running possibly switching back and forth with climbing as I will be moving closer to a climbing gym this summer.  I also am wanting to start back with martial arts which I haven't done since I was in jr high.  I have decided that I am never going back to the lifestyle that led me to gaining that much weight and being that unhealthy.  Lessons I have learned so far are:Soda, white bread, and french fries are the devilCardio is good, weight training is good, cardio and weight training is bestFoam rollers make me happyHeel striking in minimalist shoes hurtsIf anyone has any questions let me know.

s5f5o	-55072	1334195055	BTFC	Completed Transformation - M/30/5'10" 222 (Down 13lbs)	So during this challenge I turned 30, broke a 3 month plateau, messed up my heel for a week, and changed my weight training program.  All and all I consider it a win for me.  I have been pushing my running after my new shoes messed me up for a week but after I learned to run properly in them I managed to beat my best time for the 2.4 mile track by 2 minutes.  I have been swimming as well and started to really learn to control my breathing for it which has really helped.  Well on to the numbers.Current lifts areBarbell Squats: 250 lbs X4 rep on finalBarbell Bench Press: 155 lbs X4 rep on finalBarbell Deadlift: 270 lbs X6 on finalBarbell Standing Shoulder Press: 105 X4 on finalConvict Conditioning Current sets:Half push up: 2X20Flat frog raise: 2X12Half Squat: 3X16Horizontal Pulls: 2X14 Straight Bridges: 2X10Wall Headstand: 120 sec Completed progression moving on to Crow Stands next week.Starting in mid March I finally started losing weight again and have been steadily dropping since.  I was 222 today after weights but I am likely to be down to 220 tomorrow after my running.  Hopefully this trend keeps up and I can get down to 200 by July which will be my 1 year point from when I really started to take fitness seriously.  Now for picture time.[Just this weeks pictures](http://imgur.com/a/qMdXo)[This weeks with intro pics](http://imgur.com/a/1QA8E)As always my Fitocracy username is Zaydrachebd.*Edited to add all info and pics.*Edit 2 [Intro post](http://www.reddit.com/r/BTFC/comments/oo838/intro_29m510235lbs_jan_19april_12/)
xkdqh	-55072	1343920334	Fitness	Everyone has had them what are your comments from others that make you go O_o.	So yesterday I had one of those comments we all get from time to time if you have been working out for a while.  It was the VP of the company I work for and it is pretty common knowledge around the office that I have been lifting for the last year or so.  So I was getting ready to leave at the end of the day and go to the gym but before I left the VP started talking to me.  After the standard getting ready to go to the gym discussion.  He hit me with this comment.  "I have some friends who where in to power lifting in the past but it messed up their necks so they couldn't lift heavy anymore."Now I have heard a lot of warnings about lifting that at least made sense like injuries to the back and knees and the like but the neck.  Now short of dropping weight on your head or doing some very strange exercises or really bad form I can't see any reason why your neck would get injured power lifting.  So Fittit what are your out there comments that you have gotten from people.  Bonus points if you can give me a logical explanation on the neck thing as it will make my head stop hurting.Edit:  Sorry there may have been some confusion my specific question was:  What strange or off the wall fitness related comments have you received from others that have made you go "wait what".
y042m	-55072	1344615881	Fitness	Well my first year taking fitness seriously is down and my second is looking good.	To get some info out of the way.  I am currently 30 years old, 5'10", Male, 238 lbs.  I started at 285lbs.Well fittit it was brought to my attention in June of 2011 that I was horribly out of shape.  At the time I was living with several roommates and they all had started to lose weight.  I was suddenly thrown in to a situation where I was the heaviest guy in the house.  My weight gain had been slow enough that I hadn't realized how bad it had gotten until I had started trying to exercise with them.[Here was where I was at in December 2010.](http://i.imgur.com/OXW09.jpg)  [Here is me on a float trip in June 2011.](http://i.imgur.com/UZZQj.jpg)So I started to cut down and clean up my diet and started to get out and start moving again after 3 years at a desk job with little movement after work.  I had gotten up to 285 lbs and my starting weight started to drop.  I joined the local gym in July 2011 and started where many people start with treadmill and machines.  I started visiting fittit around the end of July and started to do some better research in to what I was doing.  I started looking in to compound lifts and in August 2011 I started a ss like program(I say ss like as I was stupid and didn't get the book and read it like I should have).  By October 2011 I had lost quite a bit of weight and my lifts where doing ok. [I was looking better by this point.](http://i.imgur.com/ZLTwh.jpg) I kept lifting and kept cleaning up my diet.In January of 2012 I joined the third round of the BTFC and deloaded most of my lifts to focus more on form.  [Here is where I was able to get during the 12 weeks.](http://imgur.com/a/1QA8E)By March in to April my lifts where all staling and I had tried to shift over to 5/3/1 but a combination of having to change gyms and moving caused me to miss a couple of months of gym time.  I started back in June with having read SS and focusing on getting more food and locking down my form even more.  I also kicked out most of the other work I was doing to focus more on lifting. Currently I have managed to pull an extra 20 lbs on both my squats and deads from my previous maxes.  My current lifts in pounds are: Squats 285, Deadlift 315, Bench 167.5, Press 122.5, Power Clean 105 (Started this one last and really focusing on form)  My starting lifts:  Squat 135, Deadlift 135, Bench 95, Press 75, Power Clean 60I am now at the point where I am having to deload again and I really think I am at the end of my linear gains.  I am planning on starting the Texas Method after taking a week to rest and recover.  I am also planning to start the 4th round of BTFC starting the last week of the month.  I also plan on starting Leangains (+10/-30) for the duration of the challenge.  Here is a current [pic](http://i.imgur.com/JzBuL.jpg).  Sorry for the poor quality my picture taker was my former roommate.I am thinking of adding swimming back in to my off days for the challenge do you guys think this would be a good idea.  Also is Texas method with my diet changing a good idea or should I look for something else.TL:DR I was fat still kind of am but added a good amount of muscle.
yraww	-55072	1345822759	atheism	So reading the bible.... Questioning why I thought that was a good idea.	So a couple of weeks ago I came up with the brilliant idea that it was time to read some of the religious texts of the Abrahamic religions.  This was mostly due to trying to understand where people where coming from and because apparently I am a masochist.  So I got a copy of the NIV bible and started with the old testament.  Now before continuing I will note I have done some reading as to the archeological findings of the time and area of the old testament so I understand that a majority of the "History" in the old testament is either fabricated or dramatically altered.  However I didn't want that to cloud my reading so I started reading from the perspective of they believe all this really happened.So far I have managed to get to Samuel and I must say so far I am really questioning whether or not to continue.  My observations so far are that first of all the whole omniscient omnipotent, god with a plan figure is completely missing from the first several books of the bible.  So far the god described is severely lacking power and miss placed his "chosen people" for several generations.  It also seems to have stunning anger management issues until you realize that many times a human is able to completely defuse the situation by reminding it that destroying them would make it look bad.  This god is also apparently completely incompetent as its stated goal for this whole thing is to get people in to the area in and around Canaan that would worship only one god and follow its laws.  So its method for accomplishing this is to take a group of humans lead by a guy of questionable morality to the area and tell him he is to only worship it.  It promises this human leader and the next three generations of his descendents that if they follow this one god they will "spread forth like all the stars in heaven" and rule the land.So then we get to exodus and god proceeds to essentially have a look how big my dick is display in order to free his people.  I say this as, at least in the NIV bible, god explains several times the reason the pharaoh wasn't letting them go was because god was hardening his heart.  So it wasn't until he beat Egypt senseless that he stopped messing around and got his people out of there.  So we come to the point where god has a group to take over the area it wants.  However this group repeatedly proves it is incapable of following instructions.  Also they prove that despite dramatic evidence to the power of this god and consequences of straying to idols or other gods they keep doing so.  At many points I wondered why this god would stick with them.  I mean seriously I don't think any of the other nations would have blamed it for cutting out and picking a smarter group of people.So we go through cycle after cycle of god getting the people to straighten up, screw up, get punished, learn nothing and start the cycle over again.  Even at the point I am at I don't see this ever changing.  At this point it is painfully obvious that the god of the beginning of the bible didn't create the people of the bible.  Rather the people created the god which is the only plausible explanation for the messed up relationship between them.  So now I am at a crossroads.  Do I continue with the old testament subjecting myself with more of the insanity of useless god.  Or should I move on to the new testament in hopes that the insanity at least doesn't feature morally bankrupt people.  Or should I just give this whole thing up as a bad mistake.  I mean even reading with the knowledge that all of this is made up doesn't help as knowing when it was actually written just proves those that wrote it really didn't think anything through.  Also it doesn't explain why people 2500 years later still buy this level of bullshit.  TL:DR Abrahamic religion your holy book is bad and you should feel bad.

zgxun	-55072	1346966828	Christianity	Quick Bible question.	Hey everyone, me and my roommate where discussing the story of Job and the question came up, "Where was Satan first mentioned in the bible".  This also lead to us trying to find the story of Lucifer's fall.  We found several stories and partial information but couldn't find a complete record of the fall with the exception of the story of a dragon falling.  So the question is two parts first where is Satan or Lucifer first mentioned(the snake in genesis was discounted as a literal reading of genesis holds no reference to satan).  And second does the bible contain the story of the fall specifically mentioning Lucifer or is this story gathered by taking several stories and combining them.  If the story of the fall is in the bible where is it located.Edit:  Sorry for some reason I said we where talking about Lot but it was Job.  Got them switched for some reason.
zpl7a	-55072	1347375246	swoleacceptance	Brodin reached down and blessed me last night.	I am a transswole and have been suffering from a severe case of fuckarounditis for the last several weeks.  Last night I fought back against the affliction and visited the House of Iron.  After my worship at the rack of power with mighty squats I continued with my bench press and went to finish my worship with deadlifts.  My grip had been weak previously and in my fear I attempted to use straps.  As I set up for my work set I gathered my courage and attempted my lift when I felt Brodin's hand reach down and smack me square upside my head.  I understood then my error as I knew I could lift the weight without the straps.  So I threw away the straps and crushed the bar in my hands and completed my set.
11n0m2	-55072	1350494537	atheism	The concept of eternity 	Most religions feature some form of afterlife in which you have everlasting life of some kind generally in the form of existing in your current form or through reincarnation.  The thought of a soul is bound to the idea that it functions much like the human mind and consciousness.  This soul is what is either taken to somewhere else or put back in a vessel to live life again.  This soul is also claimed to be what provides us with our personality and conscious thought.Now then when factoring in a typical lifespan the idea of living longer is appealing as most of the current population do not live long enough to fulfill all the things they wished to do while alive.  However the term eternity or for all time or some such expression of an infinite amount of time is used for this souls lifespan once created.  It is here that I have concerns.  Human's perception of time is greatly limited so I can understand where on the surface this idea is appealing.  I can also see where this concept would be terrifying when considering punishment which is also featured in the majority of religions.  I will structure my objections in two segments both dealing with primarily Christianities heaven and hell concept however also dealing with several of the other religions concepts mixed in.First for the most obvious issue of Hell.  Now this is hardly a new creation.  Many earlier religions featured a similar place of punishment.  Now the thing about punishment that anyone who studies populations or psychology will notice is that continuous punishment for extended periods of time has exponentially declining results.  Basically humans adapt to the situations they live in and if the soul is what creates this trait it in turn would possess that trait.  You are stuck with a situation where you would have to continiously alter the punishments to elicit the same results and provide more extreme forms of torture for this to work.  This is where we run in to a problem as this is happening for eternity so you will reach a point where you will run out of things that affect the soul.  In the timeframe of eternity the length of time you are being actually punished is infinitely small when compared to all of your time in Hell.  Now the concept of what would happen to you after you get to this point is never covered as those creating religions rarely had concepts of what eternity actually meant.  Many I am sure would argue that reincarnation at that point would be the most likely next step.  This only leads to more problems as Earth is not going to exist forever.  When we are considering eternity our own universe isn't going to last forever.  Will our souls start or have they always jumped to other universes.  How do our souls adjust to the altered existences of these other places.  At least reincarnating to other lifeforms on earth the soul would have a point of reference.  In a completely alien universe such a point of reference may not exist.  We would wrap back to what happens when the soul is once again released and winds back in hell.  Does that soul remember its previous experiences it would almost have to or the entire point of punishment would be moot.  So the soul goes right back to being resistant to the punishment provided from hell it is just continuously existing without purpose or release.  Technically this final stage would be the far more destructive torture of this entire experience. For my second segment I am going to look at what is described as Heaven.  I wouldn't normally cover this first part however for completeness I will say the concept that getting to heaven and only existing to worship god and all your thought and feelings being wiped away is absurd.  Any entity that can create universes that needs souls to worship it would not need to have those souls go through a life cycle if after that life cycle was complete the experiences where wiped from it.  So I am completely wiping that from the equation.  Now then the more popular ideology which is also a very old thought is going to some form of paradise for all time.  Once again we reach the same problem of eternity and diminishing returns.  Living in a first world country will quickly show that no matter how good you have it you can always want more.  Eventually you get to the point where there is no more.  When you have done all that you wished you could do, learned all you wished to learn, and have reached a point where you are as complete and contented as possible you have still only gotten to the briefest glimmer of time featured in eternity.  Once again reincarnation doesn't provide a solid resolution as the soul would have to remember what has happened or all other cycles have no meaning and reusing souls is just a recycling effort where the soul rolls the dice and hopes to not get sent to hell.  So once again we reach a point in time where the soul reaches a point of continuously existing without purpose or release.  So this system in the long term is all about torturing souls by forcing them to exist forever.I have heard many rationalizations as to why this isn't true such as time doesn't work the same way, you are happy as long as you are with god, jobs in heaven and other patch work responses that do not deal with the fundamental flaw of not understanding what eternity truly means.  I firmly believe that immortality is the most diabolical curse that could ever be given.  TL:DR The afterlife concept is only good if you never truly think about the concept of eternity.

Hi all..I run an incorporated association which is currently having a bit of a slump and not going too well, The committee and myself are looking to restructure ourselves to become a company and move away from being an association with committee and members.My question is what is the best way to do this change? would it be better to spend the money and become a company, or run it as a partnership between myself and another executive committee member? Our starting bank balance will be near zero due to us needing to distribute our assets when we cancel our registration.I dont think its a question that gets asked often but im putting it out there.

1vhp0s	-55103	1390006802	playrust	[Discussion] Similarities to Ultima Online	Just something to change up the usual topic discussions:After a couple entertaining days, I like where RUST is starting off. The home building aspect and persistent threat of players reminds me Ultima Online pre-Trammel. I'll go for a full day/night cycle sometimes without seeing another body, but it's always on my mind. For those not familiar, UO allowed players to place various different homes in the wild that would decay after extended non-use. Homes could be decorated and personalized and often, player driven townships sprouted in various areas. Home demolition was not possible, but if you stepped outside of your home, you had to be prepared to defend yourself from anyone trying to get in (or you!). I have great memories of battles fought near homes/castles/keeps where people come flooding out of their homes to rally the defenses. Similarly, there was no specific end-game, but I felt there was good balance of PVP and PVE. UO had great features that have since been scarcely found in other games. One thing I'd like to see is varying levels of item quality crafted by players (Shoddy PickAxe - Crafted by PenguinFlap vs Exquisite PickAxe - Crafted by GM Penguinflap). Or perhaps a way to sell/trade your wares/goods to other players. Are there any other features people familiar with UO would like to see in RUST?  
1vsepk	-55103	1390335712	playrust	[Discussion] Water specific equipment	I saw there was mention of cave systems in the AMA, and wondered if water systems would be something good for the game, such as water wells, aqueducts, water barrels, or rain collection devices. Water should be a vital resource, more so than chicken steaks.I'm not sure how easy it would be to implement, but it opens up ideas such as farming, water poisoning, water control, etc.

Now, taking a peek out back, it's obvious why these buildings are condemned, they're falling apart. Here's what I'm wondering, though: according to google maps, they looked livable and non-condemned four years ago. How did they get that bad in just four years? What's the story behind these buildings?I mean, I've lived in my house for about five years and pretty much never do any maintenance on the place, but it hasn't crumbled to chunks of drywall, and yet, these places are falling apart *without* the wear and tear of someone living there.

wmddd	-55120	1342403970	guns	Restoring a GECO (Genschow) Model 1919. Questions from a new shooter. Advice is welcome!	Hey r/guns,For as long as I can remember my family has had a .22 bolt action hanging up on a mantle in our house. It was known that this rifle was inoperable (we assumed the firing pin was shaved down after my father function checked the gun at a boy scout camp years ago), and could be displayed. Fast forward to late last year. A relative got me into firearms, and would take me to his gun club once a month to shoot both .22 and 9mm pistols. I immediately took to the firearms world, and started researching both getting my own NJ FID, and eventually purchasing a handgun. One night about six months back I started doing some research on the rifle that was hanging on the mantle of the house. It is a Genschow Company (Geco) Model 1919 in .22LR dating back to the 1920's. After doing further research I found that the firing pin is not shaved down, but the weapon is missing it's extractor (held in only by the bolt), which makes up the bottom half of the breach. Without the extractor the cartridge will not seat properly, and the firing pin will not hit the cartridge. Apparently this is common, as most of these rifles on the market are missing the extractor. Earlier this week I received an email in response to a forum post of mine from a gentleman who has made a few of these extractors. I have purchased the extractor and am waiting for it to arrive in the mail.Now, I have taken several pictures which are linked in the imgur gallery (apologies for the blurry ones). I have dry fired the weapon (only once, as I know it is bad to dry fire rimfire rifles/pistols), and the bolt and trigger do work as advertised. The damage to the right side of the rifle is from how it was hung on the mantle. I have taken a light wood cleaning solution (pledge wood spray) to the wood stock to get the dust off. What I am looking for is advice as to what I should do next. My current plan of action when the extractor arrives is to take the gun to a local gunsmith so they can tell me if it's safe to shoot or not.Also, please do impart any advice you can give a new(ish) shooter in this interesting situation.Here is the only video I've found on the rifle that shows the bolt and the extractor.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0u-gO-a6h8EDIT: Seems the imgur link...didn't link. So here's the link to the gallery: http://imgur.com/a/RnwmQ#0

xo5mm	-55120	1344089317	keto	[FP] Psyllium Omelet with Chicken, Mushrooms, Bacon, Sausage. 	Hello everyone!A little background first, as this is my first r/Keto post. I've been living the Keto lifestyle since mid November of last year. I started at 340 lbs (I'm 5'7"), and after eight months I am down 76 pounds to 264 lbs. I have gone from a size 50 pants to a size 46 (44 in a squeeze). My goal weight is 200 or less. I am in this for the long game, as I practice intermittent fasting (I eat between 10am and 6pm only). I have a cheat meal about once a month, followed by a day of fasting (water day).ANYWAYS, on to the recipe:* Psyllium Omelet* 2 or 3 large Eggs* 2-3 tablespoon Psyllium Husk* 1/4 cup Cheese (I prefer mexican blend)* 1/4 cup sliced Mushrooms (can be substituted with onions to taste)* 1/4 cup precooked diced Chicken* 2 slices Bacon* 3 slices Breakfast Sausage * Dash of hot sauce to tasteFry the bacon in the pan until done, remove. Add Mushrooms and Chicken, fry in the bacon fat until suitably fried to your liking. While that is happening mix the eggs with the Psyllium Husk (1 tbsp per egg) in a separate container. Add mixed Eggs/Psyllium to pan and cook like you would any omelet, adding cheese. Microwave or fry sausage in pan as desired.And the finished product: http://i.imgur.com/l7vww.jpg

1d1125	-55120	1366830570	guns	Tumbling bullets out of a .22 bolt action?	Hey all,I recently took my 1920's era Geco Model 1919 .22 bolt action out to the range to do a function check. This rifle has been in the family forever and I cleaned it up after years of display. The rifle is in good shape, only minor surface rust which has since been removed, and the rifling is in good shape as well. When I test fired the rifle on a bench-rest the first three bullets tumbled. On extraction of each round I noted a bulge in the shell casing about half way down. After the barrel had warmed up the rifle was shooting minute of target at 25 yards. The next thing I noticed was the ammo (CCI Standard Velocity .22LR) was not firing with an audible crack that you usually get from supersonic ammo. I am guessing that there is very low breech pressure, which is causing the rounds to tumble, the casings to bulge, and gasses escaping causing the loss of velocity. Does anyone have any advice for me?Pic of the range trip with several spent casings:http://i.imgur.com/EoolWai.jpgI can give you guys more pics of the rifle if you need so.EDIT: check comments for further pictures.

Like, when you think about how no matter what you do in life, most of it doesn't even matter. Lately I've just been depressed and i don't know who to talk to. I figured reddit would be the easiest place.

Right now my elo is 1143(max ranking 1289) and I want to do better. So I'm looking for a solid support to que with. I will carry as Ezreal or Draven. I'm pretty good with both, as far as my elo goes. Genj - Na  Any tips would also be appreciatedEdit: By scrubs i mean trolls who throw the game because they didn't get a lane they wanted. Not just people who i think played poorly

11vh1d	-55143	1350871247	leagueoflegends	Dodging ranked que only bans you from ranked ques	So think of those times when you have a troll (first pick auto-lock Karthus with revive teleport) and you just can't stand the idea of losing ELO because he's on your team. But yet you don't want to dodge because of 30-minute leaver ban. If it just banned ranked ques it would be so much better instead of not being able to play at all. I'm sure this has already been brought up, but I just wanted to say it.

1gvs2x	-55143	1371945693	leagueoflegends	Champion Rental System	I'm not 100% sure if something like this has been thought of before but I'm sure it has as I think the Korean servers have something similar, but why not implement a sort of champion rental system. This way players could test out a champion for a fee of say 100 IP for a 6300 champ and maybe 20 RP so that way they can test a champion without having to wait for the free week. Of course the values could be modified for each specific champion price (6300, 4800, 3150 etc.)EDIT: I don't think that champions which are rented should be able to be played in Ranked. This is kinda obvious, but I feel i needed to state it.

For it to work we would really need a lot of contributions, so I don't want to waste anyones time and effort if there's not enough interest to make it happen.  Basically, I think it would be really cool to make a montage/highlight reel/video/whatever you wanna call it, for Pi,  featuring all our players on here that want to participate.  We could have everyone on here that wanted to submit clips of their outstanding plays (snipes/jukes/tagpro rampages/whatever might be needed for different parts of the video)  I'd be willing to collect/organize them and edit it given enough time.  I'm fairly profecient with After Effects but I know we have some really talented folks on here when it comes to the editing stuff, so if anyone wanted to help with that as well, they would of course be welcome to.  I think it could be a lot of fun and when it's done we'd have a really cool 'Pi Montage'  So please share your thoughts, I'll give this post plenty of time, and if it picks up and looks like there would be plenty of contributors willing to send in clips/help out, I'll make a new post and get things started!~Abram

140zae	-55157	1354238163	LeagueofLegendsMeta	Discussion on Shaco Boxes(Kind of long)	* After riots last Nerf to Shaco, he seems to have fallen off the face of the earth.  Now I've been watching Perfects stream, who only plays Shaco, and while he is good at Shaco I still think much needs to be done to make Shaco viable in competitive. And as the title suggests I think reworking his boxes will help.* Shacos boxes don't really fit in with his current kit, except in the jungle, and for a character that does not do well late game, there's an opportunity here to make it useful for the whole game. I've tested the new jungle quite a bit, and thanks to Shacos boxes(and two shiv poison), he can clear quite well, but I still don't think that will make him a better pick.  Now what makes a jungle clear really good in the new jungle is damage mitigation, Jaxes counter strike, and Dianas refreshing shield make them both amazing on their clears. Shaco has two forms of damage mitigation, his box(fear and tank), and his two shiv poison(minion miss chance), so I think if Shacos boxes were to be removed, he would still fare fine in the jungle, especially if his new W offered some damage mitigation.* My suggestion to make Shaco better is to do something similar to what they did to Eve. Give him a shield.  I know what some of you are thinking, but what about the cc you will lose?  And I have an answer for that. The shield should not only shield Shaco, but also, when the shield is active, Procing Shacos passive(hitting the targets back) should fear the target for a short duration (cant occur on the same target within 12 seconds)* Implications 1: Shaco ganks would become quite strong with this, so perhaps the scaling on the fear duration should start as low as .25 seconds and move up to as much as 1 second. You could mess with the base to make leveling up the slow/minions miss chance on Shacos 2shiv infinetly better for jungle sustain, so if Shacos want a longer fear they end up paying for it.* Implication 2: Shaco having more effective hp, and being able to fear multiple targets more reliably will cause shaco to really be able to cause chaos among the enemy team in a team fight, which would fit his kit and style perfectly.* Implication 3:  If the fear is random direction like fiddle fear, this could prove to make it impossible to run away from a Shaco, and I believe it would be more balanced if it were a 'terrify' like hecarims, so it would be always away form Shaco.* Bonus round, another idea I had to keep this shield idea scaling into the late game is make the shield value scale with both a small amount of AP and a small amount of bonus AD, but without testing it remains to be seen if that’s necessary.

"After Capitalism" by David Schweickart is a must read for anyone who calls themself a socialist, or is curious enought about socialism to crack open a book. It presents the case for a democratic ecomy in an arguement that just solidifies as you read it.

I figure since a lot of American Democrats are both anti-prohibition(mostly drug, war on drug related) and pro-gun-control, I was just wondering why prohibition would work with guns. Also, I'm not listing my political views. Suffice it to say, they are most likely not what you think. **This isn't about politics**, I want to know the difference one perceives between gun control and prohibition.Tossing in an **edit**: Firstly, as I have said, I'm specifically referring to the war on drugs prohibition, but the alcohol prohibition works two. Secondly, For those of you who don't think its comparable, why? The main theory of prohibition not working is that if there is demand it will be met, even if it has to circumvent the law. As far as how its easier to make you own drugs, thats true of certain drugs, but less true of other types, as well as both drugs and guns are already smuggled into America.
16s6mc	-55157	1358465853	guns	I tried to post an honest question with as little bias as possible about gun control talk in askreddit, guess i have to preach to the choir.	I was wondering why people who support ending the war on drugs, and believe that prohibition measures do not work, would aslo support gun control measures, perticualre the much talked about assault weapon ban, which is essentially the prohibtion of a certian kind of weapon.  I know everyone here is pretty much pro gun, but if anyone could possibly play devils advocate or something, im genuinly curious about this.
16zn59	-55157	1358779697	socialism	Bit of a socialist catharsis[wall of text]	Here in America it is Martin Luther King jr day, on the off chance you don't know, a day that is pretty important to me becasue of the story I'm about to share.When I was first taught about the civil rights movement in around the 4th and 5th grade I was convinced that as a white male I still would have been on the side of Dr. King, putting what is right over what is best for me. No matter how sure I was of this at the time, there was always a sinking fear in my heart that I only though that now, but if I was actually there things may be different.  The idea that even under contemportay social influence I would support something like segragation, or deny another human the right to vote haunted me.  Just thinking that if I was born 40 years earlier I could have been a supporter of a crime aagains humanity never left the back of my mind as a child. This instilled a fear into me, a fear that very well may have defined my whole upbringing, and that fear was that I could be supporting today, something that would be viewed as horribly wrong in the future. This leade me to grow up with fairly liberal ideals admist my moderate conservative mother, who assured me my views would be like hers when I started 'actually working' and my conservative father.Every MLK day I am reminded of my childhood fears, but mostly overjoyed at who I have become today. I am a socialist; I fight for the rights of everyone, I see the  injustice in what most people take for granted, despite what is pushed on me by the majoriy, I still stive for what is right, and fair for all people, and if my 5th grade self could see me now, he would probably cry tears of joy, and that is the best feeling I think ive ever expirenced in my life.'To thine own self be true'Sorry for the story, but I needed to share with someone.

A lot of this paper tries to stay away from capitalism, or socialism, and I attempt to make its points stand in either case. The quotes are taking from [a book called "the industrial vagina"](http://www.amazon.com/Industrial-Vagina-Political-Economy-Global/dp/0415412331) which is an interesting read for those of you interested. It is a little rough, as it is a college papaer produced in about a week among other work, feel free to ask questions. https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwfudoHtJhk7bHA5ZmhqWkdUR3c/edit?usp=sharing*I know there are a lot of people who disagree strongly, and I'm hearing some volatile negative feedback to a anti-prostitution feminist stance. If you are among them, first and foremost, let me know why so I can respond promptly, and read the book I linked. I'm not just making things up here this is real Feminist Theory.*I'm getting some down votes, tell me why please, as a lover of philosophy my mind is always open, let me know why you think what you think, I'm not here to just convince everyone I am right, I'm hear to learn, just as much as I can help others learn.

I guess if im going talk the talk, I'll Walk.[Official Forum Post](http://nw-forum.perfectworld.com/showthread.php?262972-Astral-Diamond-Exchange-and-Auction-House-Offline)&gt;* Update 12PM Pacific: We are still investigating the situation.

Too bad it was discovered and reported in closed beta, only to still make it in. Through this exploit one can earn unlimited AD and simply clean out the AD vendors, as well as buy up all the Zen they wanted. I knew about it and reported it on the day that I logged in. My ticket was closed and marked as resolved. Upon reading it further, I noticed that a GM told me the ticket was lost and to resubmit it. I did and kept playing. The second ticket was closed and "lost again". So I gave up reporting it.&gt;**2** - Quest sharing exploit - This allowed you to reach level 60 in about an hour of playing. It also allowed people to farm unlimited bags, assets, and materials. It was discovered and reported in closed beta, but still made it in to the open beta. Once again, I made a ticket about it only to have it closed. My follow up ticket was also closed.&gt;**3** - Foundry bugs - Were used to gain max level and farm gear. Although I knew about this bug, I did not report it because I thought the other two were more important.&gt;**4** - The CW set bonus bug allowing them to hit for millions points of damage. This was a very minor bug, but it still allowed a team of two or more CW's to farm end game content. I did not know about this bug, but plenty of people in my guild did.&gt;**5** - The GF set bug - Yet another set bug that allowed the GF to almost instantly kill any mob in the game. A lot more consistent than the CW set bug, and caused a lot of damage to the economy. I knew about this a few days into the game, but decided not to report it since my other tickets kept being closed and "lost".&gt;**6** - Chest farming exploits - These are still in the game and allow people to farm easy money, as well as gear and ingredients.&gt;**7** - There is already a bot out for Neverwinter that members of Tault Unleashed have been using. Currently it can be made to level or exploit chests. They are working on having it take care of professions and auto pray for you as well.&gt;**8** - TR DC bug - this was used mostly in PvP to instantly disconnect anyone the TR targeted with certain abilities. It allowed all TR groups to quickly win matches in the least amount of time possible.&gt;**9** - Potion exploit - Basically you can have unlimited healing potions - not much of an exploit since you can accomplish the same thing easier by using any other AD earning exploit and buying potions.&gt;**10** - AutoHotkey - Macro software that allows you to easily max your crafting.&gt;**11** - AFK PvP groups - creating a few accounts and making an AFK group (managed by AutoHotkey or the Viper bot), you can quickly earn XP and gear while you sleep.&gt;**12** - Their support site has not worked since launch. That's right, you can't even request a refund or report bugs through that thing! it gets stuck in an infinite loop after you log in to submit a ticket.&gt;**13** - Dungeon exploits - There are plenty of ways to exploit dungeons to severely shorten the time required to beat them. Reaching the end boss can be cut down from 45+ minutes, to less than 5.&gt;**14** - Boss exploits - Easily kill dungeon bosses over and over for loot and seals, then reset them and do it again. &gt;**15** - There is another armor set bug which gives everyone in the party stats that are above and beyond what you can get without cheating.**edit**  from /u/tobascodagama concerning the fact that these bugs were known, and tickets about them were being closed.&gt;  "The best explanation is that those bugs were already in the bug tracker, and the deleted reports were considered not to have any more information than already existed in the system."**edit:** We are nearing an hour since the last PW update(not including responses to tweets) [I found this](http://puu.sh/2WYxn/7c004b981f.png) on thier official twitter feed [here](https://twitter.com/NeverwinterGame)[Again, and very straight foreward](http://puu.sh/2WYI4/bea7acb0be.png)**edit:** We seem to have 40 minuets on our hand with witch to speculate.

What if they make the jungle camps experience and gold yield scale with how many times a player has killed them before? Individually for each player, so by the time mid game comes, wraiths might be worth 100g for the jungler who has already killed them a lot, but only worth 40 for the laner who hasn't. This could also make counter jungleing a bit more rewarding, as it will slow the experience and gold gain increase of the enemy jungler. Just a though I've been tossing around in my head, and wanted to hear some other opinions.

If you can scrap together enough cash for a better five string, do it and live off ramen for a while. However if you have a crappy little 5 string and want a better B, this may just work.The principle here is to add more tension to the Low B string by stretching the string beyond the bridge. [And here is how the magic happens](http://imgur.com/a/c5HCy).This made a noticeable difference to my Low B, and I even tried a setup that extended it further, and made the B sound even better, however it extended beyond the body of my bass, so I just stuck with the way it is in the pictures.

22j24f	-55157	1396975920	NeedABand	Formatting suggestion	Since the goal of this subreddit is to get bands to look here, why dont we make it easier for them by formatting out posts simillarly?What I suggest is using square brackets at the front of our posts so the important things, like instrument, area, and prefered genre are visible.so for example if I am a Bassist in the Rhode Island / Massachusettes area who likes to play Prog Metal my post could look like this**[Bassist][RI/Mass][Prog Metal] Bassist of 2 years looking for a band.**or perhaps I'm in a band in the same area, who plays pop-punk looking for a backup vocalist and I wanted to post here I could write**[Band][RI/Mass][Pop-punk] Looking for backup vocalist, preferably female.**I think if this subreddit adopts a 'general formula' for formatting the title of the posts, it will be much easier to use, and gain more subscribers becasue of it.

Hey, I've been shaving with my SR for around a year now, and I am finding that with a two pass shave (WTG / ATG) I'm getting less iritation then adding a XTG in the middle. Not exactly sure why, but I also started contoring my WTG and ATG strokes so they arent 100% WTG or ATG, which is to say Ill go on an angle so I am still cutting XTG a little bit.  My shave is more consistent, just as close, and iritation has dropped to a non factor.Has anyone else done this? I think it works for me becasue It allows me to trace the contours of my face better, not to mention the grain of my beard is a bit wacky.Just wanted to share something that works for me, and see if anyone else does it.

247bv8	-55157	1398707365	LeagueofLegendsMeta	Feral Flare balance idea/discussion	Riot stated that the intention of feral flare was to open up the pool of viable jungelers, and that this has backfired, as the item is so strong that it forces out a multitude of jungelers that can't use it (although not all junglers who cant use it). Riot is probably going to nerf/rework the item to be on par with the other jungle items, and I think I have a couple good ideas. First lets examine the pros and cons of it compared to the other jungle items.   **Pros:** It encourages farming jungelers, especially those who rely on auto attacks. It comes with a ward. The on hit damage is magic, and almost all of the junglers who use it rely on physical damage, giving a lot of jungleres a high ammount of split damage.It scales extremely well into endgame, provided you have access to jungle creeps.Offers good health sustain.**Cons:**Requires a lot of farming time to become ideally effective.No mana sustain.No cooldown reduction.Discourages ganking.   **Ideas:** I think icreasing the ammount of farm nessary to convert the wriggles into the flare was a bad move. All this does is encourage a more static jungle. I think riot should reduce it back to 25 large monsters.The health sustain is very good both in and out of the jungle. No other jungle item gives sustain outside of the jungle, I think the HP on hit from flare should not be applied to champions, or at least reduced.While encouraging farming is good, the wriggles gives no reward for ganking at the moment. I think that once the wriggles is completed, It should also gain stacks towards the feral flare on kills or assists. These stacks are nowhere near as efficent as killing camps, and they shouln't be, but the jungler should not be 'penalized' by their jungle item for ganking sucessfully.On hit damage against champions is too powerfull at the moment. I think it needs to be reduced to 25% (from 33%) of the damage against monsters. Alternatively, riot could tweak the formula to have more diminsihing returns. That way riot can curb how hard this item scales into late game.   **Magic vs Physical dmg:** One of the reasons this item is so strong, as I said above is that it gives a lot of junglers split damage. I think that this is the right call. Split damage allows for carry junglers like master yi to exist and be viable. I think that retaining the on hit damage as magic is core to opening up the pool of viable junglers.

2582nc	-55157	1399747088	airsoft	Jamming Issue with gun.	So I picked up [This](http://www.evike.com/products/47650/) and I'm having a strange issue. It shot perfect for a while, but recently it has an issue where some times It wont shoot, and then a few shots later will be extremely sluggish until multiple bbs come out at once. I've tried switching mags, and even switching between my high and mid caps, and yet the same problem occurs.  I think its an issue with the hop up system, but wanted to check here because I'm not sure if its the actual unit itself being not tight enough to feed properly, or if its just the bucking being weird.   Also I've cleaned our the barrel and hop up system to make sure it wasn't just dirty, and shot multiple types of bbs through it, all .25g, bios and non bios.**EDIT:** Also, for those wondering about the gun itself. From when it was shooting well, I love it. It seems to me that this gun has the optimal fps(w/ .25g) for its barrel size, and it really stretches the range and accuracy I get out of it. Of everything I only have two issues with the gun. One: The sights on mine do not line up horizontally, and there is no was to adjust them other then bending the metal dust cover. This isn't a huge issue though, and I would have probably came up with a way to fix it already If I cared enough.Two: I wish I could field strip it into upper and lower receiver so I could access the barrel without using a screwdriver.Overall I really enjoy this little thing. Just need to get it working again.**Edit2:** Remembered I had the bucking my mad bull ultimate hop up came with that I haven't used. Installed it, and it works perfectly again. Guess it was the bucking, and I don't have to spend a dime. Good times.
2598c6	-55157	1399778566	socialism	Does money corrupt politics?	I've been mulling this over in the context of United States Democracy, and came to a strange conclusion. No, it does not. Let me explain that.  Now the problem with the current state of things is that there are large lobbying groups with massive sums of money who are using that money to lobby issues that are against the interest of the majority. Well if we trace where that money comes from, in true form to Marx, the value is created by the worker, and the profits are taken by the Capitalist. Here is where the real philosophical contradiction happens. Money has power in the political landscape, and as stated above that money was made by those who have no control over it, or those who collect it. The real contradiction is that the workers do not vote for their boss, that is to say there is no democracy in the workplace. So now you have large sums of money coming from a non democratic entity, that is being used to manipulate a supposed 'democratic' entity.  Politics can not be truly democratic, since the money used to influence it was not controlled democratically. It appears to me the issue with money in politics boils down to a control of production issue, and in fact something as non-radical as a democratic workplace could justify these philosophical faults in the system.Note that I'm not saying that a democratic workplace, or economy would solve all our problems, all I'm trying to show is that If a system that is supposed to be democratic can be influenced from a non-democratic economy(or any non democratic entity), then that system can not be truly democratic. A simple democratic economy won't solve everything else, and may not even solve the entire "money in politics" issue, but it will reconcile the staunch philosophical fault in the current system of 'democracy.'**TLDR;** The corruption in politics is not a factor the money, but rather a factor of a non democratic entity(capitalist profit) influencing a supposed 'democratic' entity(government).

1a3763	-55161	1363019106	dbz	Something I caught in "Explosion of Anger."	Master Roshi says he's always had a 6th sense about Goku and that he had "kept on digging until he hit the motherload." The thing I noticed is Roshi says "A power of this magnitude could overwhelm a man and change him forever." And that "right now Goku is struggling just to hold on to who he is." I know this may be filler, but the fact that once Goku goes super saiyan he never blinks an eye, and doesn't ever let the power go to his head. No other Saiyan in the show can say this. It's basically just a testament to how great of a person Goku is. I know we all know how great Goku is, but for me the little things like this (whether intentionally put in the show for this purpose or not) that make me love Dragonball Z, and Goku. TL;DR Goku is unfathomably awesome.

11dxbt	-55165	1350078161	Borderlands	Getting the lore right (Now with 47% more than 26% facts)	edit: ffs. Forgot spoiler tag in title. **HEY! MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!**Spoilers starting here! Don't read! Seriously! Spoilers coming up!**SNAPE KILLS DUMBLEDORE**So I'd just like to start some discussion about the various lore questions that are left with us after completing Borderlands 2, like why doesn't Jack just stop you from respawning, and why doesn't Roland respawn after being shot?**Why doesn't Jack stop you from respawning?**There are many reasons for this. The first is obviously that he needs you to reach sanctuary, encounter Wilhelm, get the power core so that Angel can lower the shields.Secondly, after listening to some of the unused audio I found this from Angel:"I hope this didn't hurt too much. Think of me like a safety net. I took the liberty to uploading your DNA to a new-u station here on Pandora. Not everyone on the planet can afford this luxury, so be aware that this will cost you money everytime you die."This means she can control the new-u station (like she can control most systems on Pandora), and probably means that she overrides Jack's command to disallow the hunters from respawning.Finally, Jack wants to kill you himself. He removes the bounty on your head, and tries to kill you at the end.So that accounts for why you still respawn. At first, it's because Jack needs you, then it's probably Angel working against Jack, and finally, Jack who wants to kill you himself.Diving into the unused audio some more also reveals some funny lines, given by Jack when reviving at a New-U station:"This is hillarious! I own the machine that just respawned you, so everything you die you're actually paying me. Wait, is that ironic, or is that one of those thing you think is ironic but actually isn't? Like a cripple doing standup? I don't know.""OH MY GAHD! HAhaaha! There goes again, oh shit! You're such an idiot! Thank you so much!""I'm considering going 'Ka-ching' right now but that would be really immature, so, lets just say that by 10% of what you just paid me by dying, I could cure universal hunger. But no, that money was better spent reviving you.""KA-CHING! Crap, I totally said I wasn't going to do that and I did it anyway!""All this dying you're doing, I can even imagine how you're going to take me down. Thing going as they are I might just spend the next few weeks killing and reviving you just to amuse myself. That'll be fun, won't it?"He has a few more lines about how hilarious it is that you are dying. He also eat pretzels.So going from this, apparently Jack also get a kick out of watching you die. He mentions to you that he stabs Lillith again and again while she is his captive, so... yeah... Phsycopath, check.This also takes out the mystery of why Roland actually dies. Angel probably protected them (perhaps), but when she died, it's game over for the original Vault hunters.**Why are everyone so afraid of Wilhelm, when you managed to take him down easy as pie?**I haven't heard this in-game, but in the voice files, Jack has this to say:"Shame that Wilhelm had to let you kill him. Heck of a soldier -- not many people would volunteer to die, just so you'd think I didn't want you to have that power core. But -- psst -- spoilers: I did.""So, Wilhelm nearly killed your Vault Hunter friends a couple years ago, and you just blow him away like any other grunt? Yeah, that's cause I poisoned him before you guys fought. Worth it, though, to make you think I didn't want you to have that power core. But -- psst -- spoilers: I did."So yeah, to dismiss the theory that Saturn is actually Wilhelm, Wilhelm is Wilhelm. Mind blown?**Is Captain Flynt related to Baron Flynt?**In an (unused?) audio, file Captain Flynt has this to say:"I'm still offering a reward for whoever brings me the head of the man or woman who murdered my brother, Baron. Yes, his name was Baron. It wasn't a title. Our parents were douchebags."**Why does not Jack Respawn after you killing him?**I have no idea. Anyone?Also, someone said that Moxxi said that she had made out with Lilith. That is actually Jang, that boasting Sanctuary guy who keeps saying he killed Crawmerax with his pinky toe.If anyone has some lore they have stumbled over, please share.
13o3kp	-55165	1353683886	Borderlands	All quotes in Borderlands 2 (This spoils the game)	As some might know, the FaceFXHintText.ini contains all the lines spoken in the game, excluding DLC's.However, the way it's formatted is not exactly nice, and if you want to find, say, all of Hammerlock's Quotes, well, good luck.So I rearranged the file, and made it nicer:	HellHath		Moxxi               Jack destroyed my underdome when he thought I was cheating on him, and now he wants to build his own arena just to rub it in my face. We're not gonna let that happen, sugar. Get out to Opportunity and kill the construction foreman who's running the project.		Moxxi               Ooh -- he dropped a  key. Do a lady a favor and grab it.		Moxxi               Every key fits in a lock, sugar -- check the containers, see if that key opens one of 'em.		Jack                Ol' balloon-tits is still holdin' a grudge against me, huh? Don't get me wrong, I understand it -- once you've eaten prime rib for free, it's hard to go back to suckin' down hamburgers for cash. If you know what I'm talking about.		Jack                I'm talkin' about dicks.		Moxxi               Sounds like that key was just the right size. See if there's anything useful in there.		Moxxi               If I know my explosives -- and I'd like to think I do -- you could use those charges to flood the construction site. If you'd blow up the nearby retaining wall and flood those pits, I'd be awful grateful.		Jack                My construction site! Moxxi, you BITCH!		Moxxi               Ha! Haven't heard Jack that angry since I kicked his plastic surgeried-ass to the curb. Come on back, sugar.		Moxxi               Nothin' like a little vengeance to round out the day.		Moxxi               Get away from the explosives, sugar -- they're gonna make a big boom.		Moxxi               There's the foreman -- drop him for me, will ya?I also sorted it by character, such as: 	Dave		Who’s that skagsuckin’ MORON up by that cannon?!  &lt;OverGrinder&gt;		Karima, don’t feel bad Jack fed yer husband to the grinder. Hell, I’ll bed ya, if ya ask nicely! Ahahahahahaha---  &lt;OverGrinder&gt;		AHHHHHH!  &lt;OverGrinder&gt;		Hey Karima -- you know what’s even better than havin’ a working shield? NOT being a woman.  &lt;OverGrinder&gt;		Karima, you cain’t make us no techy shieldy thing -- you’s a WOMAN! Now, if the town needed someone to make us a big ol’ sandwich, THEN we’d call you.  &lt;OverGunSeller&gt;		Y’all’s just gonna blow yourselves up. Better quit now!  &lt;OverGunSeller&gt;		Goddamnit, some jackhole broke the clock tower! How the HELL am I supposed to know what time it is, now?!  &lt;OverMedMan&gt;		Screw you! You can bring me medicine all day, it don’t make you less of a skagsucker!  &lt;OverMedMan&gt;	DepWinger		The Sheriff is offering 500 bucks for every Slab scalp. The Slab King's none too happy about what she did to him, so keep your eyes open.  &lt;DepWinger - Lynchwood - Speaker&gt;		This is Deputy Winger. Please don't be caught outside after hours – The Sheriff's just looking for excuses!  &lt;DepWinger - Lynchwood - Speaker&gt;		Deputy Winger reminding you that you could always run. The Sheriff won't follow you outta Lynchwood, and I certainly won't. Please – just leave! Save yourself!  &lt;DepWinger - Lynchwood - Speaker&gt;		The Sheriff has asked me, Deputy Winger, to remind you all of the individual punishments for breaking her two hundred and eighty-three laws. I'd read the whole list, but I'm just gonna go ahead and save us all some time: death. The punishment for everything is death. So please, keep your head down, and be cool.  &lt;DepWinger - Lynchwood - Speaker&gt;		The Sheriff will be conducting a sweep of the city sometime in the next few weeks. And, no – I don't know what her real name is. All I know's she deputized me at gunpoint, she scares the crap outta me, and I really hope she's not listenin' to this.  &lt;DepWinger - Lynchwood - Speaker&gt;		Dammit, everybody, stop raiding the mines! Eridium is Hyperion's number one priority, so if you attack the miners or steal their equipment, the Sheriff WILL come down on you! Don't give her a reason!  &lt;DepWinger - Lynchwood - Speaker&gt;		Deputy Winger again. If you know anyone with information regarding the whereabouts of a Vault Hunter, please – tell them to come in of their own volition! Otherwise, the Sheriff will torture the information out of them. I'm trying to help you here, people!  &lt;DepWinger - Lynchwood - Speaker&gt;However, the order of the lines are not always correct, due to how Gearbox has formatted the file.For example, in Episode 16, Jack says that he can stab Lilith over and over again and Mordercai replies we are coming, hold out. In the text file, however, it's separated. So it's a reference to what is actually said, and not the order it's said in.So, enjoy:http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3509751/Div/Borderlands%202/Lines.txt : Sorted by Questhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/3509751/Div/Borderlands%202/Character%20Lines.txt : Sorted by Character

1al2o0	-55165	1363687733	askscience	What are the properties of plasma formed at reentry in the atmosphere?	Kerbal Space Program have just released reentry effects, and some are complaining that the color of the reentry effects should be differently colored depending on the atmosphere.So that made me wonder, what exactly decide the color of the plasma formed around a space capsule on reentry.Since I knew little and less about the topic, I grasped at terms I had learned at high school such as black-body radiation, plasma, ionization, absorbation and spectrum analysis, and attacked Wikipedia and Google with raging fury.However, I cannot find anything about the properties of the plasma. I know plasma glows, and according to Wikipedia, Oxygen glows blue and Nitrogen glows pink/violet.So, is the color of the plasma blueish? From what I've seen on pictures and documentaries, it's red/orange.So what are the properties of the reentry plasma? And where can I learn more about it? My google-fu have failed me this time.

2uqzkf	-55165	1423053785	magicbuilding	Feedback on my underlying magic system	This is the foundation on which I'm building my other magic systems. It's so that I have some rules to keep to when I'm building them. Any flaws, unexpected loopholes, or anything like that?The universe consists of three fields; the primordial energy field, the spiritual field and the physical field. The primordial field consists only of raw, nondescript energy, the spiritual field is the world of spirits, and the physical field is what you can see and interact with on a day-to-day basis. The primordial energy field is a field that permeates everything; every possible universe and dimension. It's an almost uniform field of energy, which have reached the highest state of entropy. The energy does not have form, cannot do anything on its own, and cannot affect the lower fields by itself. However, the energy difference between the primordial field and the spiritual field is so vast that it's possible to open a channel from the spiritual field to access the energy in the primordial field. The primordial field is not infinite; a section of the field contains a limited amount of energy, and after it has been used, it takes some time for the surrounding energy to seep back in until equilibrium is reached. The spiritual field is a field of spiritual energy, not unlike the primordial field, but the field still has a great deal of entropy. In the field, spiritual energy join together to create advanced constructs of consciousness, called spirits. These constructs differ vastly in how they are put together, and the composition is usually referred to as the spirit DNA. Depending on its spirit DNA, spirits are able to expend some of its own energy to open a channel into the primordial energy field, and use the energy there to either affect the spiritual field, or the physical field. A spirit will constantly absorb spirit energy from its environments, and will grow as long as it exists. Small spirits will only be able to absorb free spirit energy, that is not part of another spirit, but larger spirits will be able to absorb smaller spirits. A spirit that has a tether to a physical object (what we refer to as a soul), however, are much harder to absorb, and requires both skill and effort. Usually, new spirits are formed either by two or more spirits giving part of itself to create another spirit, or it can happen spontaneously, whenever enough free spirit energy is in one place. A creature existing on a physical field is bound to the physical laws of nature. This too applies to the brain, and subsequently the mind. It follows the same laws that an action causes a reaction, and the body is slave to the mind, which follows a preprogramed set of responses. It cannot go against these responses, nor does it have any intent of going against them, as it’s just the creature's instinct. It does not have a free will. The same applies to a spirit. It too cannot act against its instinct, nor does it have any intent or wish of doing so. However, if a soul is tethered to the body, it will combine with the mind to create something that is more than the two parts by themselves. In essence, it creates free will by forcing the instincts of the soul and the mind to cooperate and come up with several compromises to every choice. Magic is in its essence the act of utilizing the primordial energy field to invoke some kind of effect in either the spiritual or physical fields. The simplest form of magic is heating up an object; done by just increasing the energy in the surrounding particles to raise the temperature. Another simple form of magic is to move object; done by increasing the kinetic energy of the surrounding particles. But magic, like everything else in the universe, is governed by strict laws. Every action has a reaction, and this is no different when concerning magic. To use magic, the primordial energy field must be accessed, and that can only be done by spirits with the correct spirit DNA. And when this primordial energy is accessed, the resulting effect in the spiritual or physical world is also strictly determined by the spirit DNA. A Vangara, using their blood arts, can only cause a set of effects, such as moving the ground around, or increasing their performance. But an Akaran mage can conjure fire, lightning, and even convert the energy into matter, creating something from nothing. Others, again, can use the energy to generate electricity, or even create life, sever the tether between a spirit and the body. Spirits tethered to a body usually are usually not self-aware. This is because the physical world is so much easier to observe and react to. Thus, there are three approaches to magic; intrinsic, mediating, and ascended. Intrinsic magic used to describe magic users who have no direct control of magic. It usually happens involuntarily, or it happens through intent. It is considered to be the weakest of the magic, as it's not as controlled as mediating or ascended magic, but there is no theoretical limit in how powerful it is. Mediating magic is the most common form, as it does not require the user to gain awareness of its spirit. It takes advantage of the fact that certain moves, gestures or acts cause a certain reaction in the spirit. By providing the right catalyst, dependent on the spirit DNA, one can then indirectly access the primordial energy field. This catalyst usually takes the form of combat moves, meditation, sacrifices or resources. Finally, if one is able to gain spiritual awareness, one is able to use ascended magic. While still bound to the effects determined by the spirit DNA, the user can access the primordial energy field directly, and access the full extent of the possible effects. When a physical body dies, the spirit loses its tether and will either continue to live, as a free spirit in the spirit world, or it can simply break and dissolve into spiritual energy. As free spirits are easy prey for larger spirits, some spirits might try to tether themselves to another physical object. There is also observed large spiritual constructs, where several free spirits chose to join together in a larger spiritual construct to protect itself against larger spirits, where each spirit still retains awareness. If by chance a tethered spirit dies, or is separated from its physical body, the body continues to live, but loses the free will. In most cases, this will simply cause the mind to keep acting as it used to do, as the spirit and mind often approach in intent and instinct. Thus, good people will remain good and evil people will remain evil. However, regardless of what's happening to them, they cannot change their personality or intent.   The spirit world is not like the physical world, in that you can touch, feel and see it. It consists solely of energy, linked together to form spirits, and thus there is no "correct way" to describe it. Every spirit observes it differently, all according to its spiritual DNA. Some might view it as the physical body is, others like an endless ocean, and some as a field of colours. Because spirits that do not have a tethered bond to a physical body are easy prey to larger spirits, free spirits are known to bind themselves to other physical bodies. Those with spiritual DNA that grants them ability to access the primordial energy field usually have an easier time to do so, as they can offer the body magic, in exchange for a tether.

p7hou	-55194	1328172366	askscience	Is it possible to predict the patterns of "Clicks" heard from an oven which is heating up from room temperature (with enough math)?	When an oven made out of metal is pre-heating, careful listening will allow you to hear it "click"  These clicks come from areas where two metal objects, which are expanding, are sliding against each other.  The audible "click" is heard when the coefficient of static friction is finally snapped where the two metal parts actually touch.  My question is...if one were able to get very exact measurements of all of the pieces, could the pattern of the clicks be predicted/ computer modeled?

I am aware that B73 is one of the most widely used lines of maize out there, and that pretty much anyone who has worked with maize has used it at some point.  However, Oh43, Mo17, and Ki3 are also widely used lines.  Was B73 chosen because it is just the most widely distributed/used line, or is there some special property within it that made it worthy to be sequenced completely?  After all, it cannot be transformed easily (or at all), and from my own experience, it is one of the toughest lines to do FISH on because the root tips just don't like to digest very well.

10v5pi	-55194	1349249719	Futurology	Could an AI program turning on its master be inevitable? 	So you're an advanced civilization who has learned the secrets of AI, and you use them to your advantage (i.e. Mass Effect and Halo).  And somehow, the AI gets untangled from "normal constraints" used to shackle it from going rogue (again, see Mass Effect).  The AI is friendly though, and assures you that it will still serve you (srsly, Mass Effect) Would that AI, in theory, eventually break that promise? Is there one unique algorithm (I think, not a computer scientist) or series of commands that would, by chance, trigger an opposite directive in the AI? As in, could it purly by chance automatically "change it's mind/override" the code that says it will still serve humans no matter what?Of course, the odds of this happening are absurdly small, but computing speed is increasing.  By the time we can Develop AI, our computing speed will have exponentially increased over ~50(?) years.Rule of large numbers.

I can also imagine that given the amount of effort which goes into movie production that SOMEONE along the line HAS to have noticed the error.  So is it common for these errors to be truly unknown at the time of release? Or does the editing crew know about them but can't really do much to fix the?

We try to launch a rocket to fulfil contracts and whatnot these days, but have to F9 and F5 a lot, which can get kind of frustrating sometimes.  But thats the thing about KSP, the main characters are *supposed* to fail a lot, so we accept it as "just part of the process" more readily than we would typically accept the process of doing something difficult.also, is there a mod that places, like, vegetation across kerbin?

I'm trying to design CAPS markers to follow in a segregating population.  My organism, a *Phytophthora* species, has a reference genome but few analysis tools available.Some programs, like EnzymeX or the NEBcutter online tool, are pretty good at locating restriction sites and telling what enzymes may be useful for a given stretch of DNA.  However, they only examine a single allele since you can't input heterozygous bases into the fasta format.  My question is: are there any programs which let you specify positions as heterozygous or allow the input of two complete haplotypes (~1000 or so bp), and then identify polymorphic restriction enzyme recognition sequences?  This would greatly speed up the process of developing suitable markers.

I really like the mod community, but it's kind of a frazzled place to look for anything geared towards... uh.... me :PI was wondering if any other Dhovakiin (pl?) out there that could point me in the direction of some awesome male-mods? I'm thinking, new meshes, clothing, that sort of thing... as muted or eye-searing as you'd like to throw out there that I could check out. I'm not really all that versed in ENBs or the like, but if anyone wants to help me swank up my Skyrim for me I'd be forever utterly grateful!Honestly I don't know anyone here, but hopefully this doesn't sound too out of the way for anyone looking to impart some pity on a wittle Canadian :D:D
23fgkj	-55198	1397906162	skyrimmods	Searching for male mesh mods	There are a lot of different mods/textures that deal with female bodies, but a kind of... lack of ones for male. Anyone have any suggestions for one that they find look less-dreary? Yes I know that there are those that will sound off on pretty mods, but I suppose this isn't the question for you :) From what I can find I got Sundracon and FavouredSoul... um... I think I need some more choices
23gcdb	-55198	1397933514	gaymers	Skyrim Male Texture Help/Suggestions	I'm starting a new journey in Skyrim, and I'd already asked in the skyrim modding page, but I thought I'd ask here too cause you know... Yous all awesome :-)Is there much to choose from other than Better Males and SOS? If there isn't, does anyone have any suggestions on tweaks, or their own preferences in play throughs? I love skyrim, but I like a slightly more personable and... Er... Boy candy lolThanks in advance!
23if1f	-55198	1398003894	skyrimmods	I'm still bugging you guys:) ---- Any thoughts on mods that change the beginning?	I can't tell you how many times I've been through Helgen now (I know, preaching to the choir and all that), but I've never given mods that change the opening much more then a glance and chuckle. I can think of Helgen Unbound and Alternate Start (unless I'm misunderstanding how they work exactly)Does anyone use them (or others)?Is there an awful lot of difference between them?How much exactly is affected by them? Like, for some reason I never want to help out Ralof, I dunno why. Do mods like this reeeeally change anything story wise? Oh and conflicts?I don't really mind the Skyrim story, I'm sure there's loads I haven't discovered yet. It's just.... Helgen.... grumble grumble... Thanks in advance!
23zh0s	-55198	1398461869	skyrimmods	New to STEP	So here I am thinking I'm a pretty competent mod user of Skyrim, realizing I've got learning to do but figuring I'm at least not the worst in the world. Decided I'd try this whole STEP dealy cause it's mentioned a lot and it seems like it could help rectify some stupid mistakes I assume I've made.Wow, everything I had confidence in before has been shat at a fan! I really didn't think I was that behind everyone else.. I just spent hours reading and clicking on each link referred to. I slightly feel overwhelmed, and that I won't be playing anytime soon for setting up a perfect (well, decent) game!
24820x	-55198	1398722384	skyrimmods	Looking for help installing BOSS so that MO recognizes it? (Pretty certain it's obvious I'm new with STEP)	After days of reading through STEP and familiarizing myself enough to get started with the large list of core et all, I'm having trouble with literally what I feel is the first step (lol), installing BOSS.I've used it before with NMM, so it's not that the program is causing me grief, it's the installing it correctly so that I can run it in MO. I've followed the directions from what I can tell 4 or 5 times the past hour, I've even gone down to the "if you don't want to install it this way, install it this other way" part in the instructions. I cannot for the life of me get it to understand that it's fully functioning (I've run it each time to make sure I didn't install it wonky). I just want MO to use it's terminator eyes to fix my apparent ineptitude. Make it so internetyverse? Any help would be awesome!
24n40i	-55198	1399146134	skyrimmods	DDSopt Question	Running through my first STEP set up (yes, I'm still at it... work's been brutal for time), and I'm wondering if I should be installing mods before DDSopt? In the screens it has some already installed, and some of the settings seem like it maybe better to wait to load some mods in?Maybe I'm just crazy lol. I'm just going down the list installing as I go, is that the best way?
24osx4	-55198	1399205412	gaymers	Slightly weird question?	I don't know if this is odd or not to ask, but being only a few weeks into reddit I figured why not.Is there such a thing as a gaymer group somewhere? Like, a few guys (or gals) who chat somewhere while playing games. I had thought ages ago back when Yahoo groups were a thing that I'd like to start a group where you could just log on and chat about games and other friend stuff while playing or if you had games in common you could use it as a spot to tell so and so to get their ass on cause you were bored lol. Can you tell that I'm an only child who didn't really have many friends?I'm not really even sure what multiplayer I've got going, but it would be awesome just to have my phone or tablet on while I play skyrim or whatever. I got so excited a few years ago when i learned that there were fact other gay guys who like gaming, but never to really act on it. I had some friends on ff14 but then my fc gone and went capooie when i wasn't looking so back playing solo it seems.I've got a ps3, nice pc and all of the nintendoes lol. Sorry if this is in fact an odd question, but again, just looking to join a onlinesque group or if there is interest I suppose we could start one.
2bc4ii	-55198	1405980131	thesimscc	Looking for good looking sim textures/meshes... Where'd they all go?	After a little over a year I'm back to Sims 3. I loved playing a slightly modded game, and am actually finding it hard seeing anything that I like. I don't know if it's because people (modders) have moved away in preparation of September, general distaste of this generation, or something else entirely, but in at a loss.I've gone through and chosen some nraas mods (basic ones really, same as I always use), a couple nifty new ones, but specifically I'm at a loss for skin meshes. MTS seems to be... almost ghost towny? I can't tell if it's just the newer design or what, but even using filters I couldn't see much that is recent.Any direction would be great, personal recommendations would be stellar! I play more male Sims then anything, I use all the expansions so I'm not opposed to realistic or quirky! Thanks bunches!
2cccrh	-55198	1406907372	thesimscc	Looking For A New Sims 3 World (Help Appreciated!)	I'm playing through Island Paradise really for the first time though I own all expansions (a year and a  bit vacation from Simming), and I'm noticing that Isla Paradiso really chugs for me. I'm not sure if it's the size, the boats, or what (yes I mod, but only errorwatch and ze like from Nraas).I'm looking for a world that maybe is a bit smaller (or at least better designed) that still has most of the expansions' options in terms of rabbitholes and lot types. My googling isn't turning up information about worlds, just worlds themselves which frequently don't list those things. I like diving and such, but I can't seem to get anything that has some in them. From what I found I think that Evansdale from mysimrealty has been updated with IP, but I was looking for suggestions that people had :)Thanks muches!
2ed2si	-55198	1408799301	AskTechnology	Having a hard time narrowing down what tablet to buy, looking for a website I used to use to figure it out	In the beforetime, if I was looking at buying a new camera or a new computer, when I googled what I was wanting to know a website usually came up within the first few hits that used a survey to determine what looks like what I'd need/want. Its been maybe 4 years since I've done anything similar, and I've gone and forgotten the site in question! It was a technology site that had reviews and things on all manner of geek toys (laptops, tablets, ereaders, desktops,cameras etc ect), but the main draw for me was that there was an option to answer a bunch of questions and it would narrow down the results and show me why it thinks I should grab whatever it suggested.This is probably incredibly easy to answer and dumb of me to ask, but I can't for the life of me think up the correct googlese to send me to the right stop. Thanks muchly!
2gl5eo	-55198	1410895038	gaymers	Hmm. Maybe feeling a little lonely?	I've been finding myself really bored lately, like paralyzingly so, and it's really tanking my mood. I'm seeing doctors and all that, but I think it's almost that maybe I'm lonely and getting depressed over that. I live with my guy, and we've been together for ages now. We both stick to home for the most part, and when we do go out it's mostly together which is fine actually. I've been trying to get him to play games with me more then I used to, but he's really not into long play sessions and we can't seem to find something other than Mario Kart that he really digs but I'm at the point where I think I got my fill of it when it came out.It's not really helping my mood though which is the problem. I remember when I started playing ff14arr, when it first came out I had some trouble finding a group but eventually I did and it was a blast until my Free Companies dissolved. After that I kind of felt like I'd be too far behind. It was my first mmo so I don't think I developed the thick skin everyone else has to do lol.So what's my point? Well, first things first I ramble and I apologize all you lovely problem solving people! I think I normally ask for game suggestions, which I'm totally going to throw in there, but I'm almost wondering about jumping into an mmo again, freeware or otherwise. I think I'm looking for cool talkative people to break up my boring times in my woefully single player life? I'm historically a Nintendo gamer, and still partake, but lately I've been more entranced by my growing steam collection. I'm really into walking dead the show and have gotten to episode 3 of the first game this morning (shocked!), and honestly I probably play more Hearthstone than I realise even if I'm not very good.In any case, Reddit is a fun place and this subreddit seems to chase stone of my blues away, and if anything getting my convoluted thoughts out helped. And made my dentist-waiting-room all the more occupied :-)
2gnmj1	-55198	1410958964	gaymers	Just a Gaymer looking to come back to Eorzea	I've been thinking lately that I might return to Eorzea after an extended break, and will be kinda new as I left just as the soldiery tomes came in. My FCs both crumbled spectacularly which largely contributed to me leaving... when you're on your own in your first MMO, it can get pretty lonely and the fun kinda gets sucked out the various holes :)I was wondering if the gaymers FC on Ultros (in ze sidebar) is a happenin' joint.. or if the server itself is populated well? I'm currently on Marlboro and pretty much assumed I'd switch servers if I could find a decent group to help me along for a little while.Any advice would be appreciated!
2gsrcu	-55198	1411074363	gaymers	Jittery Nervous... switching FF14 Servers for the first time	Just needed to write about it! I'm from Marlboro, and just reactivated my account yesterday thinking I'd like to see how populated Ultros was. I got a little sad just now logging in to double check everything was in order before I submitted the application only to see that there were a couple of my old FC mates on.I quickly did my checks and went ahead with the switch. Gasp, didn't realize I'd find it hard!
2gt0gn	-55198	1411079461	ffxiv	Switched From PS3 To PC... Now Lost!	I started in Eorzea during the beta, then played for quite a while on my PS3 until my FC just broke and it got hard to find the fun again. I'm back at it now but have switched from my PS3 to my PC, and I'm having a really hard time understanding how to control it. I was wondering if anyone knew of a link that could help alleviate the headache I'm developing? Something like literally differences between the two or something made for people that have done what I have? I had kind of assumed I'd use a controller but now I'm thinking it might be even more issue switching back and forth...?Thanks muches guys! 
2gvtld	-55198	1411151658	FFXIVGaymers	Switched servers to Ultros, looking for a new FC!	I'm not sure that this gets checked very often, but I decided to come back to Eorzea after a hiatus, and am looking for a fun active group to hang out with! I have 4 50s and am on a lot because I have no life :) I took my break after my FC on Marlboro took a rather triumphant end.. which would have been right around when philosophy tomes went the way of the dodo (whichever patch that was). I'm up for pretty much anything in regards to helping out anyone that needs it, and I'd sure love someone(s) who can catch me up to speed. Until then I shall ride my Fat Choco on a pilgrimage around Eorzea!I should add I was looking at the 'official' gaymer FC The Sacred Band but I wasn't sure if it was active or whatnot.Thanks kindly :)
2k76j3	-55198	1414161452	pokemon	Pokemon Art Academy is here!	I was so excited a few months ago; I decided to do some cleaning out of my entertainment center because I wasn't paying much of my older games. I walked out of my local EB Games with 200 or so in trade in credit so I preordered like every Pokemon game coming out.I had forgotten until about Monday of this week that Art Academy was coming out today, and I swear it's been the longest week ever even though it's just a silly little game. I don't know why I was so amped about it, but I really am. The manager of the store was in this morning while I picked up that and Fantasy Life with some extra trade in credit, and he said that he was going to save some Diance codes for me and my fiance just in case when I came in they didn't have any left! He's been really nice and pretty rad since he snagged my copy of Xenoblade Chronicles in the mass trade in lol :-DJust needed to fanboy!

2qmchk	-55198	1419779458	WonderTrade	I Loved My First Wondertrade Christmas!	I was so into throwing some cheer on WT this Christmas as an adult player without any kids around me to get excitable with, so of course I was overjoyed to learn a few days prior it was an actual thing!I started out sending some festively named Stantler and got a little teensy bit carried away and accidentally sent out my momma deer haha! So to keep the fun going I switched to Ditto all named after various jams and jellies because why not?All of my trades were just pretty basic pokemon, none were IV trained, and a few of my Stantler had some neat moves but I was mostly looking for candidates that might make a little kid laugh, and honestly what 6 year old isn't into a silly putty critter that can turn into any Pokemon? Each one was sent with just a simple Ultra Ball because I remember in Blue how much I'd hoard that first one you'd get on the Saint Anne in Vermilion just so I had a better chance at catching an Abra before it pieced out haha:-) Just wanted to share how happy I was that I wasn't just a little sentimental in wanting to spread some fun to newbies who'd get a copy of XY/ORAS for Christmas, that there are in fact cool people out there who do this sorta thing often! And to the original owners of those 3 nicknamed Weedle I got... you couldn't do any better than a dick joke lol?
2r1jft	-55198	1420151442	skyrimmods	Looking For Something Along The Lines Of Unknown Enchants	Pretty much what the title says, I've decided that not knowing if I know (that's interesting to type!) an enchant before hitting the up the Arcane Enchanter is a problem for my game.I sit there staring at Belathor's inventory wondering if I should buy that one sparkly sword or not because I have no clue if I already know the sparkliness or not.I looked around and I'm guessing that Unknown Enchants is the thing to use however it's marked at hidden on the nexus and I'm not sure how long it's been. Does anyone know of another option.. avoiding ye olde pen and paper as my coffee table is already filled with Post Its from other ideas and thoughts and numbers from Dragonborning.Thanks muchly!
2uors9	-55198	1423002773	skyrim	Can you still get both artifacts in Ill Met By Moonlight in the current version # pc ?	Pretty much that, I've just started the quest and wanted to know if you could still do the exploit to obtain both daedric artifacts? I've never done it before though have completed the quest I think 4 or 5 times now on different characters.My googling is pulling up answers of both yes and no, but all regarding older versions (and some console). I know I can spawn the missed item in my inventory, but wanted to know if I could do it the 'right' way as it was haha.What is the procedure?
30ahms	-55198	1427314398	gaming	PC Game Bundle Question	Most likely a dumb question, but I thought I'd ask..What happens if you buy a bundle from Humble or Bundle Stars (etc) and you already own a couple titles in said bundle? Are you able to keep those keys separately or potentially store them on Steam as gift items? Or do you just eat the extra cost?A cursory google came up with the latter but the links I'm getting are from quite a while ago ('12, '13), so I wasn't sure if it had changed. Thanks!
3389ts	-55198	1429535248	gaymers	Question for any Sims 4 gaymers :)	I go through these spurts of wanting to play with my little guys and I'm midway through one now. I'm slowly rediscovering the modding scene in this generation but the fragmentation that happened towards the end of the Sims 3 kinda broke how I'm finding new things. Does anyone have any particularly interesting guy-mod creators that I could hover around? I'm growing very into LumiaLover and have a couple of their mods now.Also, any fun gay content creators at all? Like Tumblr/Simblrs to follow, that kinda thing?Sorry if I'm scattered, been working all weekend and behind on my coffee and bingegaming :P
33l3ux	-55198	1429790904	whatsthisbird	Anyone able to identify a bird (couple) that visits my apartment balcony?	This is the first Spring for my new visitors, one is a little sandy brown , the other is similar but has a pinkish red head and neck down to about where it's wings sprout. Smallish, I think one would fit in my hand.. kinda like a finch of some sort? I live in New Brunswick Canada and in a city.They have a nice little sing-song chirp chirp, and seem very vocal. I have a pergala I created on my balcony (apartment in a city) that is covered in the vines from last year (just scarlet runner bean vines, too lazy to clear them out) that they like pulling apart for nest building materials. I'm kind of assuming they are a pair, usually not too far from each other (both pulling apart the plants or the pinkish one doing solo and the brown one in a tree on out lot in front of my unit).I'm really curious as to what they are (and therefor what I should name them :P)
33mhim	-55198	1429814939	gay	NSFW Any Recommendations On Make Your Own Dildo Kits?	My guy and me have been tossing around the idea of playing with dildoes of our own dicks, but after reading different reviews I'm a little lost as to what 'the one' is over others. Not really into vibrators, so ideally we'd need to figure out what would make good non-moving toys (I'm sure we could figure out how to move on our own :-P). Both of us are kinda biggish, I'm longer but he's thicker if that seems like a thing. I'm a bit worried that we might have issues fitting some of the moulds, but I think that's mostly coming from scary paid sounding reviews lol. Lastly I'd like them to have bases like our sacks, I know some kits don't have that ability. I think the one I found by Empire seems like you can have your testies included but I'm not sure how.Any bros out there have experience with these types of kits? I think the novelty and the kink is what's drawing us into it. Both of our birthdays are within a month, and our proposal anniversary is in there two (engaged 4 years). So kinda thought it might be something fun dumb and hot to do!Help is greatly appreciated guys, as are any recommendations for other subreddits to cross post (I suck at actually posting on Reddit). Thanks oodles!

They have two BOXES of Villager, so 8 total. Ike, Marth, Cap, Pitoo, and Lucario also all have 2 boxes. The girl working wasn't into them at all, but she's knowledgeable about them. I felt bad because I was the first Amiibo hunter to appear in store so she hadn't unpacked them yet. Didn't mind that I was hanging out at least. If you're double checking later on to see if they still have them she'll know exactly what your talking about so no need to dumb things down haha. I've heard horror stories about Walmart..

I want to get a jump start on next year's garden by starting seeds indoors over the winter (mid michigan, very cold, lots of snow). I am hoping to be able to plant by mid April. This will be my first time doing any growing indoors and I have no idea what I need as far as lighting. I've done a bit of reading but I'm still kind of confused. I don't want to grow anything bigger than 5-ish inches. Don't want to produce anything, just start them. Will regular fluorescent lights be sufficient?

I've read plenty of builds and finally went to pcpartspicker to do my own, but the list of parts for each category is daunting! They all seem like they only have the smallest differences from each other, but they clearly vary in price quite a bit.I'm looking to build a ~$500 casual gaming PC. I want to be able to play games on at least medium settings for the next 3-4 years, and current games on higher settings (Dota2, CS:GO, Borderlands 2). I also want to keep the ability to upgrade further down the line. I'm not sure if this CPU is good enough or if I should go with an 8-core. Do I need a cooler? Is my power supply sufficient?

However, every time try to use AMD Catalyst, I get an error that says: "Application install: install package failure!" The Catalyst window then says "Failures occurred during installation."I'm using a Sapphire R9 270x, with i3 4150, and a gigabye B85M-DS3H motherboard. Let me know if more info is needed. I'm a bit frustrated right now and might have overlooked something. Thanks guys!

It's running, windows 8.1 is installed, and I started working on getting drivers installed. However, the AMD catalyst driver for my R9 270x refuses to install no matter what method I choose. I then realized that my GPU is not recognized in device manager. The fans on the GPU do indeed work, so that tells me its getting power, right? I have a 500W EVGA bronze PSU, and i3 4150 CPU. No other power-hungry components have been added. Stock fans, and a free optical drive out of my ancient PC.I've tried troubleshooting this and I have read that my PSU could be too weak. On the other hand, there are builds out there running R9 290's on 500 or 550W.Thanks for any help. This is rather frustrating :( Please let a noob know if you require more info about the build. Like I said, this is my first one.

Got windows installed, started installing drivers, but my GPU driver had an error every time I tried to install it. I checked Device Manager and the card was not recognized. I thought it was a DOA card, so I sent it back for a replacement. I just got the new one today and I'm having the same problem.The card is plugged into the PSU via the 6 pin connector labeled PCI-E. The card's fans work (same with the last one). I'm at my wit's end. I just spent all my savings on this, and it doesn't work. Help! Thanks in advance.

sq3u2	-55208	1335283048	phisigmapi	Are there plans for this subreddit?	Hey guys! I was thinking about creating a Phi Sigma Pi subreddit, which didn't work since this one obviously exists instead. I was wondering if there were any plans to actually get use out of this? I was just curious since, obviously, I'm interested in one.
tfffy	-55208	1336601534	phisigmapi	2012 Proposed Amendments and 2012-2014 National Council Nominees	Well, here is my attempt to try to get this subreddit going, for all three readers out there, lol. This seemed like a good topic to get started with.If you're reading this then you probably already know the 2012 National Convention will be in Orlando, FL from August 2nd through August 5th. Grand Chapter will take place during August 2nd and 3rd.Here are the [proposed amendments](http://phisigmapi.org/portals/0/convention/2012_Proposed_amendments_PP.pdf). They are password protected due to there being amendments to the Ritual; use the fraternal word for the password. There are a whopping 38 amendments! Three of those pertain to the Ritual. There is also the [Constitution and Chapter Standards Committee's report](http://phisigmapi.org/portals/0/convention/C&amp;CSC_2012%20Amendment_Report.pdf) on the amendments, but it's a pretty light report this year.There are also elections for the 2012-2014 National Council. Here are the [2012-2014 National Council nominees](http://www.phisigmapi.org/MarkYourCalendar/NationalConvention/2012CouncilNominees/tabid/5378/Default.aspx), along with the [National Council Elections Guide](http://phisigmapi.org/portals/0/convention/2012%20council%20nominees/2012_Election_Guide.pdf).I know there aren't really many people following this subreddit, but it's got to start somewhere, right? I think the format would be great for Phi Sigma Pi discussions, as opposed to Facebook where things can quickly get lost in the shuffle.

uxmpv	-55208	1339487194	Guildwars2	Some information on collection node "farms"	I tried seeing if this had been posted here before, but I couldn't find it anywhere. It seemed like something that would be of interested to people. The beta forums are being wiped tomorrow, so I decided to go looking at developer posts while I had a chance because they sometimes drop information that hasn't otherwise been made available.Across my own travels, I noticed a large number of resource nodes for cooking materials one or twice, so I took notice when somebody mentioned this in the forums with a developer reply. [Here is a link to the forum post](https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/game/crafting/Collection-node-farms/page/1#post235398), but obviously that will be closed after tomorrow and not everyone has access, to here is the text from the relevant posts.OP:&gt;I made it one of my projects this weekend to get into crafting and harvesting, and one of the really cool things I kept running into was a group, or “farm” of 8 close-together collection nodes for a particular cooking material. By beta end I had found two potato farms, a lettuce farm, and two strawberry patches.&gt;Locations:&gt;Lettuce farm is in Queensdale, south of Beetletun in the topmost farm area.&gt;Potato farm 1 is directly south of the Loreclaw Waypoint in the Plains of Ashford.&gt;Potato farm 2 is in Wayfarer Foothills scattered around The Osenfold Shear.&gt;Strawberry patch 1 is in Kessex Hills, at Isgarren’s View. You have to carefully make your way down the various cliff edges without dying to successfully farm all 8 strawberry nodes. I absolutely loved having to do this.&gt;Strawberry patch 2 is in the southeast corner of Snowden Drifts, at the bottom of a cliff near Griffonfall.&gt;Did anyone else find any of these? My apologies if this has already turned up, I tried looking for similar posts and had no luck.&gt;Edit: According to Tempus there is also a spinach farm in northern Gendarran Fields. That leaves 6 out of 7 maps covered presuming one farm per map. Did anyone come across the farm in Diessa Plateau?Here is the response from Linsey Murdock:&gt;Glad you like the farms (that’s what I call them too)! There is, indeed, one per map. Farm nodes are on a 23 hour timer, so you can only hit them up once a day, but since there are always 8 nodes in each farm, you still net a lot of mats and it gives you a once a day task to log in for. Each material that is used for a farm is ONLY found in those farms. There are no more than 2 farms for each type of farm material.&gt;I think they are neat. Glad you guys picked up on them!

16q9n4	-55208	1358392808	phisigmapi	So, who plays Minecraft?	I've been renewing my interest in Minecraft lately, and it can be pretty fun, but it's a ton more fun with other people. My and one of my roommate's play sometimes, but he's not always interested in playing. I've tried playing online, but I tend to feel less like I'm playing with someone as much as I am merely just playing with other people around.I was just wondering if any Brothers out there like to play and if they'd like to play online. I'm also available for doing voice chat via Mumble for added communication. I'd play vanilla Minecraft, but lately I'm been more interested in mod packs such as Tekkit (before it got terribly outdated) and, more recently, Feed the Beast.Or, if you've never played Minecraft before and are interested in trying it (note that it does have a one-time cost of about $26 to buy the game), I think it'd be interesting to play through with someone else and help them learn the ropes.I also watch a lot of Minecraft videos on YouTube and have thought about attempting such a series for myself, especially since I have a video production background, but I'm not sure if it'd be worth the effort. But I also wanted to throw the idea out there if that intrigues anyone. I think teaching someone else Minecraft would be an especially interesting series.
19vhay	-55208	1362696181	Yogscast	Yogscast playlists on YouTube	I've mentioned before in some comments that I use playlists that I've created to keep up with Yogscast videos. I created these for my own benefit, especially when I originally was watching the Shadow of Israphel series and catching up on about five months worth of Tekkit videos. I had noticed that the playlists on the Yogscasts channels were often incomplete and often didn't contain similar videos from other channels, so this was a way for me to centralize stuff. For example, if you wanted to watch all of the Yogscast Tekkit series, you're going to be bouncing around from channel to channel and are going to have a difficult time watching everything in order.Anyway, I figured I'd share them here and hope someone else might get some use out of it. Again, keep in mind that this was for my own benefit so this was not an attempt to categorize every series, especially series that can be found on a single channel. But hopefully someone will get some use from it. I try to keep the playlists up-to-date, which usually happens whenever I get around to watching a new video throughout the day. I won't guarantee there aren't any mistakes/missing videos, but I think they're good. Anyway, here are the playlists. Enjoy!* **[Minecraft Series / Shadow of Israphel](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLED30FFDB4EAB0722)*** **[Custom Minecraft Maps, Part 1](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF164CAC98E6AB212)*** **[Custom Minecraft Maps, Part 2](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSHkqKOIKnehGct9MlSje3CRnXgKpJU0e)*** **[Minecraft Mod Spotlights / YogLabs](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2D324B2431DD5642)*** **[Minecraft PvP](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL87DBDFE2572F29BB)*** **[Tekkit, Part 1](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD052F13627717AE3)*** **[Tekkit, Part 2](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSHkqKOIKnehbaPVyJ3L5OrIJcCUM17WK)*** **[Tekkit, Part 3 / Feed the Beast](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSHkqKOIKnegFLLFxhhsj3ofBClWMowuC)*** **[Portal 2 stuff](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL418E928A5F2A6F0B)*** **[Minecraft with Sips and Sjin -- Seasons 1-3](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL83606B475C1CB69D)*** **["Let's Build" with Sjin](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL61894220F575C7C5)*** **["Diamonds in the Rough" with Sjin and Nilesy](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDF6F5C169A719234)*** **[Garry's Mod](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSHkqKOIKnejVMWjuCZ4Ho16p29L5B1GV)*** **["Spacemen" animated series](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSHkqKOIKnehZF0jRU9bZ0pkw6BNCh6BO)*** **[Voltz](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSHkqKOIKnegXkytS4GnbpvWC_N2Lludf)**Edit: Also, if it concerns anyone, I don't get anything out of this.

1a6im5	-55208	1363131443	Yogscast	The YogCraft Mod Pack is now publicly available through the Feed the Beast Launcher	[Here is the list of mods](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/yogcraft.14683/)  (and changes to the mod pack when they're posted). The Feed the Beast launcher and other information [can be found here](http://feed-the-beast.com/).Feed the Beast also added two new mod packs and also updated practically all of their other mod packs. The site might be experiencing a large amount of traffic as a result, so if you experience connectivity problems, that might be why (I was having troubles with the site, but that might be a local issue.)
1lunq5	-55208	1378473786	Yogscast	Like watching Yogscast members duke it out in-game? Me too, so I made a giant YouTube playlist	I had originally made a playlist for Yogscast members playing Minecraft PvP, but because they have been branching out PvP to other games, I crawled through all of the channels as best as I could and found nearly all PvP videos put them into a playlist, which is almost up to the 200 video limit for playlists, so I have went ahead and made a second placeholder playlist as well. I'm sure that it'll begin to be populated very soon, maybe even today depending on what videos are released. If you are interested how the playlists were made and how they are organized, feel free to read on. If you're not interested in that, then here are the links:* [Yogscast: PvP, Part 1] (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL87DBDFE2572F29BB)* [Yogscast: PvP, Part 2] (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSHkqKOIKnegyrg_ZOwbHHIuEx52qI-Nw) (~~Placeholder playlist, currently effectively empty~~ Edit: I noticed some mistakes I made, which meant adding a few new videos, and therefor this playlist is no longer empty)Please note that while these links go to my personal YouTube page, I do not do much with my channel and am not trying to promote it or anything. I just wanted to share this playlist (something I've done before actually.) With that said, I actually have a number of Yogscast-related playlists, and I plan on doing a couple more here in a bit (Top 5 videos, and YogNews videos), so feel free to look through my other playlists, but the PvP thing seemed more relevant and current. As I've mentioned, I had already made a playlist for Minecraft PvP matches, but I wanted to expand it so I took the time to do so yesterday. I manually crawled through practically every Yogscast channel in an effort to find anything PvP-related.All of the videos revolve around Yogscast vs. Yogscast. So these playlists do not include other PvP videos such as Game Station/Polaris tournaments, or regular multiplayer games such as Nilesy playing Team Fortress 2. I occasionally made a few judgement calls, such as including the Geoguessr videos (which I hope to see return one day :) ) and not including some random videos of Sips and Sjin messing around in War of the Roses, since they weren't really full on matches or anything.Regarding the organization of the videos, I started out by having them sorted in chronological order of release date. From there, if there is a match with multiple perspectives in multiple parts, then a person or team's perspective videos are organized all together. So for example, with the giant Survival Games match you could watch one team's complete perspective in order.If multiple series overlap, such as the numerous PvP matches that have occurred since the Civ V Challenge series started, then the series that started first his placed higher. This means that even though the Civ V Challenge videos are still ongoing, they will be added earlier than many of the recent videos coming out, and videos at the end of the first playlist will be pushed to the beginning of the second playlist as that series continues to expand. A series will not be split across two playlists.Alright, I'm done rambling. Hopefully somebody will make use of these playlists :)Edit: I forgot to mention, in case it needed to be sad, that I'm not perfect, and there definitely may be mistakes, ranging from omissions to videos being out of order or whatever. I was reviewing playlists just a bit ago and fixed a bunch of stuff. So if you see anything wrong or have any suggestions, feel free to let me know.

1wgzeo	-55211	1391010992	TalesFromRetail	My awesome introduction to supervising.	This is my first post here, so stick with me and my wall of text. :/So the basis of this story...I work in a store that does not take coupons. We offer sales through automatic coupons that come off at the register based on what type of membership the customer has.I was recently promoted to a front end supervisor position. By recently, I mean my manager threw me in the deep end head first and started me as a supervisor on the weekend before Christmas. I haven't worked there a terribly long time, but I do know our policies when it comes to these automatic coupons as I'd been a cashier before. I should also say that on my first day as a supervisor, I was scheduled as a supervisor. Not scheduled as a mirror so I could directly shadow another supervisor...just thrown into it. I was nervous, but confident that I understood enough about the job to get through it.This particular customer had a complaint at the register that an automatic coupon did not come off of one of her items. I double checked that she had the proper membership for the discount...she didn't. I explained to her that she didn't get the $1.50 off of the item because she didn't have the upgraded membership. All of this is something I would have done as a cashier, and I'm sure the cashier that called me over probably had gone through all of that already because she started to bitch about how the signs didn't say it was only the upgraded membership and how it was only $1.50 and I should just give it to her.I had another cashier that needed an override, so I explained that I would check with the floor associate about the signage, which only required calling her on a walkie and was just a matter of about 30 seconds, no longer than it would take for me to do the override...and that I would be right back. This is the Saturday before Christmas, so we're slammed...I was multitasking the best I could. If the sign was in fact wrong, I would have given her the discount.I come back to the register and the lady is cussing at the cashier about me, making a big scene over this $1.50. I told her the floor associate said the sign was clearly posted in two places that it was only for the upgraded membership and told her that it was not our policy to give those discounts to regular members...I feel like this is common sense, because otherwise there would be no incentive to upgrade if we're just throwing these discounts around to anyone. She's still upset and tells the cashier to just cancel her whole order. So I clear the order out of the register, take the cart she's shoved into the walkway and tell her, with a giant smile on my face, to have a nice holiday. I move on to other people who need my help, despite the fact that she and her friend are bitching VERY loudly about me still.About 5 minutes later, the cashier was apparently done with the lady's friend. I was headed off to help another associate, moving at a pretty quick pace, when the lady passed me on her way out and the friend stepped in front of me, blocking my way and stopping me dead. I started to say "excuse me," and she said "No. YOU should be ashamed of yourself, KILLING someone's Christmas spirit like that."...insert me, dumbfounded.I started to apologize and explain again that it's just our policy. Then the original customer joined her friend, yelling "I used to work at (another location of my store) and that's just some bullshit! You couldn't just give me the discount? Why? Because you're a Christmas-hating bitch?"Normally being treated like that would upset me, but it took everything in me not to laugh in her face. At this point, one of the managers took note of the situation and stepped in, telling this customer that she needed to back off. The lady said again that she used to work at another location, like that entitled her to something...turns out that manager actually knew who she was and cut her off, saying "Well having worked here before, you know our policies and you know she's just following them. If you ever come in here and speak to one of my associates like that again, you will not be welcome back in this location."I should also note that, after my shift, I went shopping for a few things and happened to see that the item she was insisting was discounted wasn't even the right item. It was a larger version of the item that had the discount, and she was trying to scam because there weren't even any savings signs posted on the item that she had.TL;DR: Woman tells me I killed her friend's Christmas spirit while woman herself abandons her whole cart and calls me a Christmas-hating bitch over $1.50 discount...that I might have gone ahead and given her had she not been such so completely rude from the moment I walked up to help. Manager stands up for me and all but kicks her out.

izxqs	-55215	1311661302	AskReddit	My 3 friends and I are backpacking throughout Europe in August. Do you have some tips/places to go/things to pack that we wouldn't think of/or any other wise advice for us?	Obviously we've done some research as to where we want to go and things we want to see. Maybe some things a little off the map might be nice. Any great bars/pubs to hit? Little towns we must see? Hostels to stay at? What to avoid? Any wise traveling advice? Anything is helpful. As of now, our tentative "route" (as in places we might go to) is: London&gt;Amsterdam&gt;Berlin&gt;Prague&gt;Interlaken&gt;Cinque Terre&gt;RomeThanks!
ldetb	-55215	1318708343	jailbreak	I messed up my iPhone SSH'ing a lockscreen into it. I think I changed the code/software and now I need help fixing it. Any help appreciated!	Okay, first off let me say that I'm an idiot.I have a jailbroken phone and I was trying to SSH a lockscreen theme onto my phone. After many attempts, I finally got it to work, except on my lockscreen the words "slide to unlock" were still there and I wanted them gone. So I searched the web and found [this article](http://itsalltech.com/2011/02/21/how-to-remove-slide-to-unlock-text-on-ios-lockscreen/) explaining how to do it. I have zero experience with programming/software, and I was basically just deleting random shit, and screwing up the software on my phone. Long story short, I deleted the file from step 3 from my phone and now [this](http://imgur.com/a/mJk0n), is what shows up all over my phone. Not sure if it matters, but I am running iOS 4.3.3. Is there a quick and easy fix or I am fucked? Can someone just go into the same file from their phone and copy the text and send it to me so I can use it or no?Thanks!

3gzebe	-55222	1439564429	Advice	There's a good chance my [16 M] band will be signed to a label. Parents hate the other members	So last night we got a call from our manager telling me that a producer has heard a few of our groups songs on local radio and wants us to make a demo tape. The producer has also hinted to our manager the he is wanting to sign us for a couple of grand per member. HOWEVER my parents LOATH the people I work with. I love them like family and we've all been friends since the beginning of middle school... I'm really not sure how to approach my parents as they aren't aware of me being in a music group and will not approve of it at all. I can't pocket the money without them knowing as they have access to my bank account and if I decide to go through with this (still deciding on if waiting is a good idea) I will no doubt have commitments I can't hide... we've been able to make songs when we all have time but being signed to a label will add commitment and responsibility... what do I do?

3htvy1	-55222	1440149729	techsupport	I bought a Samsung s4 new and it came rooted?	I'm really not sure if this is the right subreddit but anywayFor my birthday I was bought a new Samsung s4. We bought it for a really good deal however when we booted the phone a few things were wrong. Primarily my Samsung has a root Explorer app installed on the phone after we configured the settings. This is obviously not suppose to be on a factory version of the phone. After running a virus scanner on my phone I confirmed that it was rooted and has a program called prefer activity Setter. My phone has ZERO reason to be flagged for any issues as it was only JUST booted out of box. After going through my trusted Credentials there are well over a hundred credentials that are incredibly suspicious credentials relating to roots that I 100% did not install or allow. I'm worried about what people may be able to get off my phone and what not. I don't know what to do or how to go about doing it. No one online seems to have my problem either which makes it harder. I don't mind having a rooted phone as there are some great benefits but having a phone that I bought supposedly brand new rooted out of the box throws up way to many red flags. We've messaged the company who sold the phone to us asking what the hell is going on but they are taking quite a bit of time to respondAny advice, suggestions or ideas are greatly appreciatedEDIT: If this isn't the correct subreddit could someone direct me to one that's better suited for this topic? Thanks

Shoulder feels tired all the time, and hurts after exercise	Hi there,I'm a 22 year old white male, about 6 foot tall, 65kg.I play volleyball on a regular basis (mostly two times a week) and during the last season I noticed a pain in my left shoulder. I figured i'd just been more active than I used to and its my body adjusting, but after over a months break over Christmas with next to no physical activity I still feel a "tiredness" on the shoulder even when its idle, going up to an ache if I just use it a little. Its not crippling even at its worst, by any means, but its quite bothersome when trying to focus and perform during a game.I would suspect its something like tendonitis/tendinosis, but as I have never had that condition before I'm exploring options here before I go to the doctor.Thanks in advance for tips and suggestions :)

I developed hernia http://imgur.com/zuJ83tY and was generally a sick child in my early years. I have since recovered and am living a normal life. I do not remember much from living in Paraguay. I moved to Canada when I was 5. It was quite easy for me to learn English due to my young age (Having only spoken low German my whole life) in Canada I have attended 4 schools, and am entering my 5th school for my senior year. I live in southern Manitoba and have 5 siblings (3 sisters, 2 brothers) http://imgur.com/tGtQks7 I have visited Paraguay several times http://imgur.com/H1bh7Ak My first job was a paper boy for my local paper. I have since moved on to being a waiter at a Mexican restaurant (for 1 year) I am the only guy employed there. I drive a 2004 Chevrolet Malibu LT and am dating the girl of my dreams. I consider myself a movie buff, my favourite movies are Goodfellas (1990), Casino (1995), The Kings Speech (2010), The Weather Man (2005), and Fight Club (1999) That's all I have to say, if I'm in the wrong subreddit I apologize

I want to make this a little bit more interesting with health bar and a click function for each turn and maybe something more in the future. The question is which is the best language to do this? I was thinking about take the values from php and save them to javascript variables. For the life bar I was thinking to use Bootstrap progress bar. Do someone refer something else like Ajax or other?This is my view so far [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/m1kg9KQW)

I have been trying to figure this out for a while now because I feel like the way I think is not normal.  When I think about my past I see it like it's happened to someone else. Obviously it is me and these are my experiences, however it seems like there is a complete detachment from my past and current self.  I have very few memories that I have held on to and those that I do remember are usually fragments of a memory and are usually inconsequential and don't really seem to be important to my life or that specific experience to which it is attached.  For me, it's not just with memories from my childhood.  When I try and remember something from last week, very few details come forward if any.  There is very little visual memory, however I have no problem remembering information.  What are you thoughts on this and how do you see your Past?

If you use them for a time period of less than that, put them in a plastic bag or something that you can seal them off from the oxygen in the air. I use sandwich bag. I opened a pair of hand warmers around a month ago and used them on four separate occasion for about an hour and a half. Just take them out of the plastic bag and shake 'em up! They seem to take longer to warm up after each subsequent use, but you get a lot more miles out of them.Stay Warm!

I've been working on a DIY  security system with an arduino,a webcam, a servo, and a motion detector.  I've got my webcam streaming to a remote red5 server.  When my arduino detects motion, it sends a command (simple GET request) to my server and RTMP dump begins recording the stream remotely.  My problem is that I'm streaming using Flash Media Encoder.  FME works well, but I need something that I can have automatically connect and start streaming on start up.  Does anyone have any experience with streaming to an RTMP server like this?

I was curious if any redditors are taking this flight, and if so, do you have a spare seat for another enthusiast?  I know its a long shot, but I feel like I need to at least try.

2iynqf	-55253	1413051522	SecKC	Pwn2Win Challenge September 2014 Writeup	Here is a short breakdown on the September Pwn2Win Challenge.* The first step was to download the app from the google play store  [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=seckc.seckc.pwn2win)  * When you open the app, you see a big button that says "Push the button XOR die", when you push it you see the following ecrypted string:&gt;d208128bf26a691375c6301863a48e6aa69eb32849889ee717b48663adaae5b3e0594d9597581e1ffc34681cff3ecfc271edace315d5513f85c0fe922ec10d5e387b0c7d9477439302c298a5* We weren't sure what to do with that string so we moved on.* On the play store page, [there is a link to the developer website which is the first clue](https://seckc.org/challenges/android/NFC.txt), which ultimately gave us this morse code string:&gt;Well, that was easy if you were at SecKC... otherwise you are remote and needed this file.I shouldn't just hand over this part of the challenge... but, because I am a Good guy... .... - - .--. ... ---... -..-. -..-. ... . -.-. -.- -.-. .-.-.- --- .-. --. -..-. -.-. .... .- .-.. .-.. . -. --. . ... -..-. .- -. -.. .-. --- .. -.. -..-. ... - .-. . .- -- .-.-.- .--- .--. . --. &lt;-....- -....-  - .... .. ...  ... .... --- ..- .-.. -..  -... .  .- .-.. .-..  .-.. --- .-- . .-.  -.-. .- ... . * If you run that through a morse code translator, you get the following:&gt;HTTPS://SECKC.ORG/CHALLENGES/ANDROID/STREAM.JPEG – THIS SHOULD BE ALL LOWER CASE* If you go to the link, you get this [image](http://i.imgur.com/OWefgco.jpg), named stream.jpeg* The next step is to run that image through steghide It prompts for a password, leave it blank&gt; steghide extract -sf stream.jpeg* This gives us the following [output](http://pastebin.com/kuH0dXSB), but most importantly we get two encrypted strings* The first string has a clue that it is the location of the cipher image "aHR0cHM6Ly9zZWNrYy5vcmcvY2hhbGxlbmdlcy9DMDgxMy9jaXBoZXIucG5n" which is base64 encoded and decodes to:&gt;https://seckc.org/challenges/C0813/cipher.png* The next string is "uggcf://frpxp.bet/punyyratrf/naqebvq/pnxr.wcrt" was encoded with ROT13 and decodes to:&gt;https://seckc.org/challenges/android/cake.jpeg* so now we have three images, stream.jpeg and cipher.png looked very suspicous to us. We could tell there was data encoded in them but we were unsure how to extract it.  I tried using imagemagick to programatically combine the two images with a xor algorithm, but no luck.  Eventually, I threw both images into photoshop, added a transparent layer to the cipher.png and lined them perfectly to make the following [image](http://i.imgur.com/f9qhSrT.jpg). Giving us the following key:&gt; e864228798ca169087ba45f1671ac2be* Next, you need to use steghide on cake.jpeg and use the key we just received from overlapping the stream and cipher images to receive the following clue:&gt;The Secret to decrypt the XOR is: SecKCake* The final step is to take the long encrypted string we received from the app and xor it with the key "SecKCake" to get the following&gt; Key 1 - fd09c583112c385fa7625178adb2038959d73960cf4d853a31cdb7f0f312f0a2* We emailed the above key to Cory and that was it, we won!

I can't remember if he was blind or not. He is special in some way, maybe enlightened or close to god. Anyway, he is talking to another man who happened to come by.Some of the key points of the book:* Religion is like looking inside a church, and each window is painted a different color. One man swears that the room is red, another may swear that it is blue, and they will fight to no end.* The universe was created because there was a god, and he was infinite. An infinite being has no desires, as thats a mortal emotion. It has no wishes, no dreams, no risks, no fears, no challenges, except one. That one challenge is to destroy itself, and see if it can form again.* God is the combined knowledge of super advanced human beings, [i think]anyway.. any help is good.. I really liked this book, it blew my mind when I was in High school.

None of this voicing business. I HEREBY PROPOSE /ɹɜtɪt/ or [ɹɜdɪʔ]EDIT: Understandably, English stops do force a lot of different features from vowels when the stops are word final (like aspirated stops becoming unaspirated and shortening the length of the previous vowel), but they never really "voice" unless they're intervocalic.

My professor told me this, and I've cleaned up and got a stripe. However, opponents keep saying that I'm too "tough", and constantly refuse to spar with me. I'm in South Korea and i'm about 95Kg, athletic, 6'2", most guys here are 60-80kg and under 5'11".. When I spar, my opponents always end up out of breath, while I'm still completely relaxed. And I keep telling my self to spar less vigorously, and I feel like its hurting my ability as I'm letting my opponent pass my guard and I try not to fight out of side control as much as i should.. Whats worse is all the guys that I started with have attained more stripes than me even though I can still best them in a sparring bout by just technical ability alone. It's like I'm stuck at one stripe, being told by my professor to be more smooth (whatever the hell that means..) and not being able to spar as much as I want...What do I do?

I started out on Phantasy Star Universe and eventually transitioned to Final Fantasy 11. I would still be on FFXI but the abyssea expansion completely demolished everything the game was to me. I really liked the combat system of FFXI and the freedom of it as well. I also really liked the fact that you had to spend some time looking for a party but if you were ok with taking it slow soloing was an option. I am traditionally a console player but I have a decent(?) gaming laptop. The main thing that I didn't like about FFXIV was the combat system of endless weapon skills until the mob was dead. It got really boring really quick. Any suggestions would be appreciated and p2p is completely fine by me, almost preferred.

I need some help remembering a couple anime.The first anime is about a school located in a quarantine zone and the students think that help will come but it never does. The walls of the quarantine shrink killing anyone who goes near. Towards the end some people end up with powers and I don't remember what or how. There was also a girl named Hare I believe.The second anime is about an all girls school that trains for personal mechs and a guy somehow gets in by some never before seen stuff. I don't remember too much about it other than there were girls from all over the world each with mechs or corresponding colors.Thanks in advance.

What i did not expect was what happened when i put one in my mouth and started chewing. It dissolved into a mass that stuck to every surface of my mouth, and it tasted EXACTLY like stomach acid, or vomit. It was indistinguishable from a mouthful of vomit.Can someone who is into Asian food culture please explain this to me? I'm not prejudiced, and i mean no offense, but how is a product that tastes exactly like vomit even remotely marketable anywhere?

I doubt this will make a difference, but I think some of the talk that happens here is potentially damaging some people's ability to achieve lucids, and perhaps we need to be more aware of that.I often see "common wisdom" without any evidence being spread as truth. The problem with this happening is that lucid dreaming is self-fulfilling, meaning if you think something will or won't happen, then that is what occurs.The 2 major problems:------------1) Sleep paralysis being scary. This is probably the biggest one, because I can think of no better way of inducing night terrors than telling people about (the dark man/the hag/insert scary SP story here).SP is not scary for the vast majority of people who expect it. If you don't know what it is or what to expect, then some people's brains will make up nightmarish scenarios. But even then, the majority of people just can't move, and it sucks, but there is no demon crud going on.The number of times I have seen people here say "I can't lucid, but I wouldn't WILD if I was you. SP is hell on earth" is out of control. I don't need to explain why passing judgement on something you haven't experienced is bad, but these people are the outcome of the problem, not the cause. The problem is people who should know better continuing to propagate myths about sleep paralysis.2) I just got into a bit of an argument in another thread about WILD from first sleep, as opposed to WBTB. It seems that a common thread among a subset here is WILD cannot be done without waking up at 5 in the morning, because "something something REM cycles".This is wrong. I WILD when I go to bed. I also WILD with WBTB. I will go as far as saying that *for me* it seems easier from WBTB, but I suspect that is because I don't practice perfect sleep hygiene and can struggle to go to sleep at night.My point here is the 'old-timey wisdom' of how REM cycles work, without any evidence to back it up, is stated definitively as a global experience. I personally doubt this is even how REM cycles work, and suspect we do not drop straight into REM with WILD, despite experiencing it that way, because sleep doesn't work like that.My point though is I DON'T KNOW. Telling people what they cannot do when you have no evidence is wrong. It is so accepted by some that they will argue about it despite given contrary evidence ("I can WILD at night" followed by "No you can't, no-one can"). ---------These are my bugbears. This place is great compared to most LD communities because it is 'science-based' and discourages astral projection talk and such. I think this minor lack of self-awareness is a flaw in the community right now.Solutions? Add a bit in the sidebar about not running your mouth when you don't know for sure what you are saying is right, at least not pretending it is fact. Downvoting these topics and comments. Possibly even removing particularly damaging "everyone who WILDs gets devil possessed" bollocks.Does anyone agree? Disagree? See any similar problems in other common topics? Other solutions? /rantEDIT:omnomnomable has made the valid point that "Mirror horrorshows" are another perfect example of the type of thing I am talking about. They also suggest as a great solution that the sub uses some sort of [spoiler] tags for anything that could derail learning lucid dreaming. This is a great idea, I wonder how easy and successful implementation could be?
wuhjy	-55294	1342743256	advancedluciddreaming	What techniques are actually needed?	Hi all, Good idea here, this is by far the best spin off of the main sub that could exist. Quite a long post following, hope you don't mind but this place needs some active discussion. As a disclosure, I don't count myself as 'advanced' per se. I LD several times per week, mainly with WILD. Occasional in dream lucid achievement too, but less frequent.I do also have a passable (formally trained) knowledge of neuroscience, cognitive psychology and basic understanding of neuropsychology. I have performed EEG sleep studies as well.I have a question/challenge.. to quote an alternate reality fictional character based on a real person "how do we know what we think we know?"There is a lot of 'common wisdom' when it comes to lucid dreaming. The scientific basis of lucid dreaming is progressing, but the questions being answered do not (and probably cannot) address *how* to lucid dream.Advanced lucid dreamers as a group seem to accept that much of what is taught to beginners is tricks and self-deceptions, for example needing to stabilise dreams, or dream control being a challenge. Advanced folks seems to think more about concepts like mental hygeine, manipulating their internal beliefs and schema.But at the most basic level ... what is *required* to lucid dream, technique wise? Let's challenge the most basic assumptions. Considering there is no specific scientific literature on most of this, I am willing to accept experiences at face value, so if someone can do something that contradicts current wisdom, then that is at least weak evidence that the current wisdom is wrong. Obviously weak evidence can become stronger with reliable testimony or multiple people agreeing.I think one side point is that natural lucid dreamers cannot provide evidence ... they didn't have to learn. Their brain was set up to do it from the start. A natural lucid dreamer saying "I don't need a dream journal" is not really evidence in this context. Interesting, yes, but not evidence of underlying mechanisms.So first we need a brainstorm - what are accepted elements of lucid dreaming? I have listed what I can think of but I will add any that other people want in the list -1. Dream recall techniques. People seem to think this is required, although there is some discussion on methods.Does anyone achieve regular lucids without any form of journalling or active dream recall? Do many people get by with replaying dreams/thinking about dreams without recording them? How little time is reasonable to devote to dream recall?2. Dream sign awareness. How many people never needed to actively decide on dream signs? You might not do it now because it is second nature, but how many *never* defined differences between dreams and reality?3. Reality checks. How many *never* used reality checks? It seems fairly common to not need them eventually (I rarely reality check now) but are reality checks a required trigger for the brain to learn lucidity? Did anyone manage to become proficient with lucid dreaming without any use of reality checks at all?4. REM issues. This is a big one, and I have had some discussions already with jc and others. How much does sleep timing play a role?I personally WILD on first sleep (usually takes 10-20 mins), rather than with WBTB techniques. To me this is weak evidence that WILD does not work by 'staying awake until you enter REM sleep'. That does not mean anything about what phase of sleep you dream in, just an observation.Does anyone else do this? Does anyone else have experiences that seem to go against normal ideas about sleep cycles?5. This probably relates to 2 and 3, but does everyone find all day awareness *better* than formalised reality checks/dream sign awareness? It seems to be considered a higher level/more fundamental technique.That is enough for now. I am sure people here with think of far more interesting things to talk about.I think I could have set this out better and phrased it more clearly, but the prime motivation is to generate discussion and gather knowledge in one place, about what is actually 'true' in lucid dreaming.

yoiwm	-55294	1345698207	atheismplus	Atheism+ as a safe space for alliances.	As atheism+ has taken off and many great posts have been written about why it is a good idea, there is a point I haven’t seen made yet, which is important for the existing atheist community – A+ is a great, non co-opting way for the SAWCASMs (read privileged white guys) in the atheist movement to express and contribute to social justice. This is a difficult concept to discuss, and I really hope I don’t veer off course. Many activists may disagree with my thoughts too, and that is ok. I am discussing the topic through the lens of feminism, but it applies equally all other injustices. I am a SAWCASM. I have watched many of the battles in feminist spaces regarding male activists from a distance, and decided early on (with help from some friends) that I would not call myself a feminist, but rather an ally. This is a decision every man in the social justice movement has to make, and it is a very tricky subject. Essentially the basic argument is this:Feminism fights patriarchal oppression. It is a social movement and a safe space. A man in a feminist environment may have great intentions, but in practice can be exclusionary, oppressing and threatening. Most people have probably seen the stereotypical male ‘feminist’ in various forums, who lectures women on how to be a ‘proper’ feminist. Due to their privilege they cannot understand the lived experience of the oppressed. I personally think in spaces not designated as woman only, male presence is fine, but in activism *the oppressed drive the conversation*. So I don’t call myself a feminist. A small thing, but language matters.So that out of the way, we come to “feminist allies”, “pro-feminists”, and ”feminist supporters”(scare quotes!). I have always been a little uncomfortable with this too. When I say “I am a feminist ally”, it sounds like I should be sticking out my chest. With a cape on. And that is the worst possible outcome of me supporting feminist issues. Ingrained patriarchy means that we tend to promote male voices and demote female voices. Many feminist groups end up with women getting drowned out by men. What makes it worse is that some self-described allies refuse to acknowledge this. We end up with r/allieswelcome, a space where flouncing allies can go to rule the conversation. Because they want to make a clear statement that they (privileged folk) *felt unwelcome* in spaces for oppressed people. The driving point of my argument is this, and here it may get controversial. I didn’t have a label that was comfortable, for myself or for many feminists. Calling myself a feminist was co-opting, calling myself an ally was too self-promoting.But “I am an atheist(+), and therefore I support your cause” is none of those things. It does not co-opt oppression. It does not promote me as an individual. And it does not specifically identify a particular oppression that I am individually trying to ‘fix’. It works just as well for the entire gamut of social justice issues. It feels like saying “I am here because you are right”, not “I am here because you need my help” or “I am here because I am awesome”.The obvious counter-argument I see is that I have no right to expect a comfortable label. That is true, but this is positive-sum *if* it makes activists feel better about how I label myself.So, in that vein, here is what I want to say. I am an atheist, and therefore I support your social justice issues. And because I respect your right to react to that however you wish, I hope you will tell me if this works for you.

z2du5	-55294	1346308488	atheismplus	So did Richard Carrier learn a lesson?	Maybe. I will leave that up in the air, but provide this -In the megaprose he wrote about how to insult people [here](http://freethoughtblogs.com/carrier/archives/2289/), he held most comments for several days before replying. I am not criticising this, he is probably busy and had tons of comments etc. but it did have the side effect of no-one having a real-time discussion or noticing his responses.Exhibit A:question @ 25 by M.A Melby:&gt;"It seems strange that you said NOT to use the word “retarded” and then used the word “retarded” – as in “genuinely retarded people”.Did you mean developmentally disabled?Intellectually, learning or cognitively disabled?Of course, generally those terms aren’t even used much, but the specific diagnosis is."to which, he responds -&gt;"You must not have visited the hyperlink on my first use of “mentally retarded.” It is still a valid clinical term in medical use. My use in the case you mention is in that sense and not intended as an insult. And my link explains in detail the other point you wanted to make (that there are a lot of different kinds of disabilities covered by that umbrella term, and often not the kind of disabilities people who use the term as an insult even have in mind)."So, thats a no to general stopping using words widely accepted as epithets. More of a "but I didn't intend it as a slur". Forget actualy *listening* to people who find any use of the term hurtful. Is "intellectually disabiled" that much harder that he can't avoid "retarded"?Am I being unfair here?

We would need people who are attending to be willing to staff a booth for some of the time, hopefully not big chunks of time if we can find enough A+ers, to hand out cards and discuss the intervention/receive feedback.This is part of the pushback against sexism and harassment in the community, and if I was in USA I would go. We need to get off our butts and promote the cause. I am able to do organisation and such from here, but we need boots on the ground.So anyone interested? If anyone was thinking of going but having trouble with costs also let us know. Atheism+ is new and has not fund-raised before, but we could try and cover costs like the Skepchicks do to promote women attendance.

Review of "Killing Them Softly" (spoilers-ish)	So, here is a review for the movie [Killing Them Softly](http://thehoopla.com.au/killing-softly-rachel-ward/). It has got me thinking.When I saw this movie with my partner she found it entertaining, if vapid and a bit boring. I found it unwatchably offensive, like the husband of the review.I can get the hang of the hypothesis the reviewer has (women face misogyny daily, and are desensitised), but wondered on the thoughts of others here.In most spheres, my partner reacts very strongly to this sort of thing. She is a card carrying, protest marching feminist. But this film didn't cause much of a reaction. She says that she also found it over the top and pointless, but did not get the same emotional response.So, why did I react so much more? I don't really know. It *was* disgustingly offensive, with not a single character voicing dissent from the casual misogyny. For me it ruined the movie, for her it was just another artistic element.How did others respond to this? Does anyone have insights or links to relevant concepts? Most importantly, is my (and reviewer's husband's) reaction just a privileged man co-opting outrage?

The problem is pretty straight-forward - where do you draw the line between "words matter" and tone-trolling. I know both when I see it, but it can be hard to explain. This is how I read that sentence from Kassiane:&gt;If a person with disadvantage criticises the tone of a person with advantage, they are saying that "I am having trouble getting past your tone to hear your argument." They could be saying "I am running low on spoons, and today your tone is beyond my ability."&gt;If a person with advantage criticises the tone of a person with disadvantage, then they are saying "I have tons of spoons, but I still choose not to hear your argument". The are probably saying "I can put up with the tone, but it suits me not to."Obviously this framing can't be black and white, all advantage is complex and relative. But for me this helps a lot, because words matter but tone trolling is bad.Thanks, Kassiane. Sorry for the con-douches.

If they are happy discriminating, they should be happy to let everyone know, right?There are a number of other issues, but these things in particular strike me as grossly wrong, and clearly on the wrong side of history.

So, we have DD telling Harry new information in the post-Phoenix debrief. 3 students have been called upon by the phoenixes, including Harry.1. John, cousin to Lavender Brown. Accepted the call and died.2. Harry, rejected the phoenix.3. A woman, rejected the phoenix, "and the grief of it broke her".So, who is this woman?Options as I see it. 1. Artistic license by the author. No relevance to the story.2. Lilly Potter, who chose her family over the Phoenix mission, and then sought out death with Voldemort due to the breaking.3. Bellatrix, who chose Tom Riddle over the Phoenix.4. Narcissa? Burnt to death trying to summon a phoenix?I have put those in rough order of likelihood. Number 4 is particularly implausible.Any other options or opinions?Bonus question - why does Voldemort have a Phoenix feather wand - the embodiment of all that is good? Did Voldemort ever get a Phoenix mission? Did the young hero?
16irbc	-55294	1358123874	atheismplus	Non-US based social justice problems.	With the general US-centricity we have here, I thought we could expand our own knowledge by having a topic about the problems in other countries, from the view of their inhabitants. Inspired by the Malaysian Atheists who have been exposing us to their particular issues. Thanks rewarp!I am Australian, and while we do talk about Australia a fair bit here it may be useful to have a concise rundown on some major issues currently facing Aussies.1. Gay marriage [remains illegal](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-09-20/an-senate-votes-down-second-bill/4272428) despite [wide public support](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recognition_of_same-sex_unions_in_Australia#Public_opinion_polls). The ruling centre-left party members support gay marriage too, but the more conservative powerbrokers are blocking it happening.2. Religious businesses remain [able to discriminate in hiring](http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/politics/gillards-bizarre-act-of-faith-leaves-vulnerable-unprotected-20130113-2cnf0.html), purely because they are religious.3. Abortion by choice remains [ILLEGAL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_Australia#State-by-State_legal_situation) except in the ACT. SA, NT and Tas hold that economic and social reasons are not good enough to justify abortion. Most Australians have no idea about this, as the laws are not enforced. In SA every abortion needs 2 doctor consent, abortion is part of *criminal law* jurisdiction and women &gt;28 weeks must travel interstate even for medically justified abortions.4. Government funding pays for religious chaplains in schools in place of trained counsellors. This continues [despite being judged unconstitutional](http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/political-news/chaplains-safe-despite-high-court-ruling-roxon-20120620-20n2d.html) by the High Court.5. Australia continues to [lead the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_detention_in_Australia#Restoration_of_offshore_processing) in 'protect our borders' racism. We take people who risk their lives on boat voyages from Indonesia, send them to 'processing centres' for periods of up to 5 years. If they do make it to onshore processing (because the detention centres are full) they are not allowed to work, isolating them from the community.6. There is also a bunch of nasty stuff happening to our equivalent of social security, most recently single parents got slammed with cuts of up to $110 per week, all in chasing a budget surplus.7. Indigenous issues remain hugely problematic, with a massive [gap in life expectancy](http://www.budget.gov.au/2008-09/content/ministerial_statements/image/indigenous-2.gif) and health. I am sure I have missed a number of things, but these are some of the battles being waged currently by those with A+ values. Anyone else know of big ones I have missed? I didn't have a gender-based one because the [success of the test-case](http://www.news.com.au/business/low-pay-workers-granted-pay-rise/story-e6frfm1i-1226259496594) for wage equality is a huge step forward.So, what is happening in your countries? What issues are important right now, and what should we keep an eye on for any opportunity to help with?

16yofq	-55294	1358733596	atheismplus	Thread about racism and stereotypes in r/science ... not awful	I have been following this thread with dread, but somehow the social science deniers have not had their way.Top comments&gt;A sociologist would tell you that there's 4 tiers to "racism":&gt;1. Racial Categorization = identifying someone's race. Eg. "That person is black"&gt;2. Racial Stereotyping = Racial Categorization + forming opinions based on race. Eg. "That person is black, so he's probably good at basketball"&gt;3. Racial Discrimination = Racial Stereotyping + action. Eg. "I'm choosing to be on the basketball team with all the black guys, because they're probably better at basketball"&gt;4. Racism = Racial discrimination + position of power. Eg. "I won't hire any black people to work for me"&gt;Racial Categorization is not harmful at all. Simply acknowledging that someone is black, white, or asian doesn't do any harm. Some would even argue that Racial Stereotyping isn't harmful either because you are just forming thoughts and haven't acted on them yet. You're 100% right, we form these thoughts based on patterns because that's how our brains learn.&gt;The problem is that sometimes we don't get a large enough view of the world. If you grow up living in an all-white community, and you're only knowledge of black people is what you see on liveleak, then your brain is going to start to assign those negative behaviors with the race because you don't have any counter evidence.+290!&gt;An interesting concept that's come up in social psychology is called stereotype threat, where a person's performance suffers at a specific task simply because stereotypes "in the air" work against them.&gt;For example, they had black and white students play golf, and when they said it tested "innate athletic ability" the black students outperformed the white students, but when they said it was a test of "strategic athletic intelligence", the white students outperformed the black ones.&gt;If you're interested in reading about these issues, this book by Claude M. Steele (the psychologist who discovered this effect) is not only a clear and interesting overview, but a collection of wisdom in the rare way that few academic authors, save Oliver Sacks, are: http://www.amazon.com/Whistling-Vivaldi-Stereotypes-Affect-Issues/dp/039306249X+262!I am impressed, to be honest.
16yqd5	-55294	1358735305	atheismplus	Giving for good comments	This is an idea for those who can afford to donate to charity. Over on reddit I came across [this comment chain](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/16s0g9/shermer_responds_to_feminists_attacking_him/c7zqotu?context=3) in an otherwise bad thread. The remainder of the comments are hidden.The idea has grabbed me. I already try to follow [Peter Singer's Pledge](http://www.thelifeyoucansave.com/pledge), which amounts to 10% of income over a certain level. I generally use services like GiveWell to try to maximise the effect, although these services are flawed in many ways, as they have to value certain outcomes over others (usually lives saved/dollar).But here is an option for a two-fer. Allowing someone else to choose a charity for you because they have improved a discussion, by being particularly insightful, rational, persuasive, honest or whatever. Someone who should be encouraged, and someone who should be seen to be encouraged.The way I see it, I could:&gt;1. Sequester a certain percentage of my 'charity funds' for the project&gt;2. Divide that into bite sized small donations, maybe 5 to 10 dollars.&gt;3. Divide the year into donation blocks, to see how many I can give out per year&gt;4. Give them out to people who are cool! This can be outreach (like giving in non-SJ places to promote good discussion) or inward focussed, which particularly could be cool for people who can't afford to donate themselves, but always have really good shit to say.Are there any downsides here? Even if the charity chosen is not one I would pick myself, it is still charity. It is unlikely to be a terrible charity, as the only people who will recieve it have to already be awesome.I am specifically thinking of targetting reddit myself, and particularly non SRS/a+ areas as outreach. Does anyone think this is a bad idea? Would anyone else be interested, even in just pointing out good comments for anyone who could donate?

1a7d2z	-55294	1363159682	atheismplus	Comment on /r/technology about PETA and tactical oppression	So, I am vegetarian (mostly vegan) and generally hate PETA for all various problematic approaches they use to get into the media.[This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1a593e/peta_goes_after_assassins_creed_for_its_depiction/c8ubwlg) in the tech sub has my mind somewhat blown. I can see the truth of it.&gt;Folks underestimate PETA. Almost ten years ago (I think?), I was accepted into a training program and met with their leaders and PR execs, including Ingrid Newkirk. At the time, PETA had just started a campaign where they suggested that people should drink beer instead of milk. MADD was up in arms. A media frenzy ensued. PETA and MADD went on multiple TV news shows and debated fervently. MADD talked about the woes of drunk driving, and PETA talked about the woes of drinking milk.&gt;Here's the kicker: before their scuffle with MADD, PETA would really only go on news shows when they were asked to debate the actual issues of animal rights infringement. And in those news shows, PETA's message was muddled by the debating. Now, when MADD came along, I remember one of the heads of PR saying how thrilled she was. On the one hand, MADD could talk about the woes of drunk driving--all fine and good--and PETA could agree with MADD's concerns. On the other hand, PETA could make statements that would otherwise be objectionable in a debate--that milk causes disease, for example--and MADD wouldn't object to the premise or present the counter-argument; they'd just go back to espousing their talking own points. In other words, PETA and MADD got airtime to express their ideas, and neither did much to critique the other's viewpoints. A win-win.&gt;I've seen this PR tactic over and over. Like clockwork. When PETA compared animal domestication to the suffering endured in the holocaust, for example, they got a lot of airtime. The Jewish representatives talked about the needless and incomparable suffering and the PETA reps talked about the deplorable conditions in factory farms. And, as controversial as the stance was, PETA was able to successfully get unchecked quality national airtime--airtime where they could critique factory farming without having to debate directly with a representative of the farming industry.&gt;The general formula here is: 1) find someone to insult who is not directly in opposition with your message, preferably someone who might actually even partially agree with you. 2.) Insult them. 3.) Sit back and hope the insulted party says something like, "though we agree with PETA on x, we take offense to the tactical approach they took on y." 4.) Appear on TV or on the web to discuss the contention, and voice your opinion with minimal critical response.&gt;In the case of Ubisoft, though everyone seems to think PETA is being idiotic here, they actually bated Ubisoft into admitting that whaling in its non-digitable manifestation is not condonable. And if a kid reads Ubisoft's response, they may hate PETA fervently but they now know that one of their favorite gaming companies finds whaling to be otherwise detestable. And, though PETA may be mistaken for thinking such, they will likely chalk that up to a win.If anything this is making me hate PETA all over again. I always just saw it as controversy-generating tactics to get airtime, but intentionally targetting unrelated oppressed groups to get asymmetric debates feels even dirtier.In this case, it is a gaming company so fair play to them I guess, but the same tactics are reguarly used to promote shittiness.Not sure if anyone else cares, but I thought it was a thought-provoking idea directly tied into PR skepticism and social justice.

1aq5ye	-55294	1363865071	atheismplus	[Effortpost] Tropes vs science - gender assumptions and sporting capacity	**WHAT THIS IS ABOUT**The **certainty** of sexual dimorphism in sport came up in thunderf00t's recent "tropes vs Anita" video, using weightlifting as an example of the obvious inherent differences between men and women. And I say pshaw, as well as **bad science**. Sex differences in sporting performance are anything but settled.*As a proviso - "male" and "female" and similar words are used below as they are used by sporting regulatory bodies. I acknowledge this is grossly binary and offensive, and doesn't represent the science or experience of human variation. Which is kind of the problem. So, Trigger Warning for gender binary bullshit.***BACKGROUND**The current women's records in weightlifting (the archetypal strength sport) are equivalent to the male records up to around 1972 (the [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world_records_in_Olympic_weightlifting) doesn't give granular data and the time lag may be significantly smaller).So, women of today who do weightlifting are *as strong* as the men of the 70s as measured by olympic weightlifting. How is that possible if there is an inherent, insurmountable difference?**TESTOSTERONE**The biological reason given for inherent difference ([sexual dimorphism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism)) is usually testosterone. Why testosterone? Studies have shown in vitro (test tube) effects where testosterone increases muscle dimensions and strength and so on.  Population level common sense shows men are stronger, bigger and faster than women. And testosterone is manly, right? This is the favoured hypothesis to the point that the Olympics Committee and IAAF can now decide who "can participate as a woman" by [testing these levels](http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Commissions_PDFfiles/Medical_commission/2012-06-22-IOC-Regulations-on-Female-Hyperandrogenism-eng.pdf) and even actively seeking out women athletes to run these tests on.So, big organisations with tons of scientists. Case closed?[Nup](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/fivering_circus/2012/07/olympics_sex_test_the_international_olympic_committee_has_a_way_to_test_whether_athletes_are_men_or_women_is_it_fair_.html). 5% of women elite athletes have "male" levels of testosterone. 6% of male elite athletes have "female" levels of testosterone (unpublished data by IOC). An overlapping range shows, at least partially, that testosterone cannot explain this "30 year gap" between records.Even more so, in the same data 25% of male athletes had testosterone levels below the "male range". Yet they succeed at their sports of choice. Women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome are [over-represented in elite sport](http://www.academia.edu/1264578/The_Science_of_Sex_Verification_and_Athletic_Performance). They have no response to testosterone at all, yet are more likely to be an elite athlete than the general population (less than 1/5000 in general population, 1/420 in elite sport).And testosterone levels in [a recent study](http://jap.physiology.org/content/112/11/1805.abstract) did not predict muscle growth post exercise! Women and men created the same amount of new muscle fibre post-exercise, even though men had 20+ times more circulating testosterone.So, pretty clearly the testosterone hypothesis is bogus. There is simply no correlation between testosterone levels and success in elite sport. The test tube results as always don't apply on the macro level, and the population level results must have some other confounding factors.But that doesn't mean the sexual dimorphism argument is bogus, right? There could still be a different hormone, or more likely a whole complex mix of biology, to cause a real significant difference that is inherent and insurmountable.**ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS FOR DIFFERENCE**Let's return to the weightlifting. Women are as good as men were in the 70s. Both male and female weightlifters have improved. What has changed?1. Participation2. Training methods3. ????*Note that biology hasn't changed. So any answer that includes "biology is the sole determinant of sporting achievement" is wrong.*If it is the training methods, then women and men should advance at roughly the same rate, right? Each group benefits from the same discoveries.Well, they don't. Women are [catching up](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/sunday-review/why-olympic-records-are-broken-or-not.html?_r=0). Check out the graphic on the left under "multimedia". It shows winning times in 1968 vs 2008.The graphic can be divided where the blue bars end, which is essentially the cutoff between pool and field sports. In the pool, women have improved their records by an average of 11% in 13 events. Men have improved by 10% in 15 events (or 13 events excluding the 1500m free and 4 x 200 free relay). And yes, that is a 10% difference, not a 1% difference (you sneaky stats manipulators!).In the field events it is harder to compare because women didn't get to do a fair few of them in 1968. If we only look at comparable events women advanced their winning time/distance just over 4%, men only gained 2.27% (10 events). Even including the 2 *best* events for men in the field (pole vault and hammer throw) they only make it to 3.6% improvement.And yes, that is a 10-40% difference in rate of increase.So women are gaining significantly faster, meaning it is not *just* training methods. Training methods may play a role, but the fact is that times and distances are converging. Even in weightlifting. From the page above I randomly selected a weight class (62/63kg). Since 1992 (60kg class) men have not improved at all. But women have lifted 15% more.So, not training methods. Then what? I honestly cannot see anything but participation and access. Women are allowed to take part, and encouraged to more and more. We can see it in the Olympic events, women were excluded for a long time. A bigger pool of potential athletes means a statistical outlier of amazing talent is more likely to arise. And there are probably genetic explanations for some of these outliers, but there is no good evidence that they exist on the X or Y chromosomes. Some people will argue a range of things to deny the main point here, but no-one can argue that biology is the sole determinant of success. Not rationally. I admit there may be other explanations than my own ...**TROPES VS SCIENCE**But guess what? This shit has never been studied. Despite the big bucks in sport and training science, this is all too hard. Another example of the gender bias in science. It is assumed in tons of research that testosterone is the reason for gender difference. They don't even cite anyone for it. For more discussion on gender distortions affecting "what gets researched" see the [Rationally Speaking podcast](http://www.rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs77-victoria-pitts-taylor-on-feminism-and-science.html). Skeptics favourite, honest!**TL:DR** Women are catching up to men in elite sport records, and have been since women started playing sport, decades after men were competing and advancing. Testosterone doesn't explain ability despite the IOC and IAAF basing policy on this flawed science.Scientists have pretty much based all research on gender differences in sport around a flawed hypothesis. As we see in many fields of science, gender stereotyping affects what gets researched, skewing all the results before the measurement is even done.Is there a gender differences that means something in real world sport? Who knows. The evidence doesn't exist.All we know is that all the data points to convergence in sporting achievement at the top level. We have no evidence to suggest this trend will stop. As skeptics and scientists, we should find out.*edited for formatting*

People can be *really fucking different* and still be totally normal people. Corollary is that if a person from another culture self-describes as part of the same movement as you, but does it differently, you must accept that some of the difference may be cultural, and *permanently* lost in translation.&gt;Show solidarity. If someone you are allied with does something wrong to another marginalised group, say promptly and loudly that the action was wrong. Do this *before* you criticise the marginalised group for something unrelated. This is very important because silencing, elision and dismissal are the primary tools of the bad ally.Feminists have no excuse to be unaware of these rules, considering race-oppression in feminism has been a mainstream topic of discussion since the 70s, related to the problems people of colour faced in the movement.**THE FACTS:**&gt;1) Amina Tyler, Tunisian feminist activist (and self-described Femen member), protested lack of women's freedom by posting a photo of herself topless with the words (in Arabic) "My body belongs to me, and is not the source of anyone's honor" written across her chest.&gt;2) Various Islamic clerics said she should be punished. For example cleric Almi Adel, leader of Tunisia’s Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, called for Tyler to be “punished according to sharia, with eighty to a hundred lashes, but [because of] the severity of the act she has committed, she deserves be stoned to death.&gt;3) Femen lauched a show of solidarity with Amina, called the "Topless Jihad" where members would take barechested photos with messages written on them.&gt;4) Some of these [were racist](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18jpc9i1c1laajpg/ku-xlarge.jpg). There are numerous other examples.&gt;5) There has been a large pushback from Mulsim women in the protest "Muslimah Pride". Many complained about the racism, many argued for western people to stop deciding unilaterally how to protest women's rights in the middle east, many argue that Hijab/Niqab etc is empowering for women. A diverse group made up of feminists and non-feminists.&gt;6) There has been pushback from intersectional [western feminists](http://jezebel.com/5993775/muslim-women-shockingly-not-grateful-for-topless-european-ladies-trying-to-save-them) too.So, a complex issue. Which of these actions is right or wrong? My opinions below, based on the above rules.&gt;1) Totally right. Tunisian feminist protests for feminist issue.&gt;2) Totally wrong. Everyone who supports social justice has common ground here.&gt;3) Mostly right. The organisation Amina is a part of is doing what she did as a sign of solidarity. They are *supporting a member of that ethnic and cultural group in the way she utilised herself*.&gt;"Mostly" because Femen has form doing the exact same thing without middle-eastern members input, so the fact they are in line with intersectional ideals this time is perhaps more luck and timing than anything else. Femen leader Inna Shevchenko said "(Muslim women) write on their posters that they don't need liberation but in their eyes it's written 'help me'."&gt;4) Totally wrong. This in not what [Amina wanted](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/10/mideast-feminists-against-femen_n_3052175.html?utm_hp_ref=world). Nor is it acceptable to be this racist in any context, even in support of women. Conflating Islam and being Arab is wrong. Conflating Islam and radical Islam is wrong. Playing mocking dressup of a radical Islamist as a caricatured Arab man in the middle-eastern equivalent of blackface is worse than wrong.&gt;5) Some mix of right and wrong. Certainly there are multiple perspectives and multiple complaints, which shouldn't be criticised as a single block.&gt;6) Some mix of right and wrong. No-one denies that cultural relativism can be taken to extremes, although this is like [straw feminism](http://www.harkavagrant.com/?id=341) - some people like this do exist, but the argument is made against them several orders of magnitude more often than their actual prevalence.So considering all this, perhaps a generic type of valid response would be "We support Amina, reject calls for her punishment, support those who show solidarity in the way she wanted, reject racism and hold a nuanced position on the pushback, which both supports the above but hears and doesn't conflate the varied disagreement from people directly involved in the issue." This is a really generic response, and there is heaps to talk about at the edges of it, but denying the basic principles would usually be problematic.**THE RESPONSE AT FTB**I am going to focus entirely on Freethought Blogs as emblematic of modern SJ/atheist ideas in respect to Islam. FTB is a place where intersectional approaches are the norm, so should be "not getting it wrong". I am focussing on a few white bloggers. They are the allies here, and this post is about ally behaviour. There are certainly other bloggers there who are directly affected, and hold some of the same views and some more nuance. Feel free to read them at [A Million Gods](http://freethoughtblogs.com/amilliongods/2013/04/11/balance-muslim-women-vs-topless-europeans/), [Maryam Namazie](http://freethoughtblogs.com/maryamnamazie/2013/04/05/our-day-defend-amina/) and [No Country for Women](http://freethoughtblogs.com/taslima/2013/03/29/women-should-know-that-their-body-belongs-to-them/).Also for a good background approach to how race and culture interact with social justice movements, do read [Black Skeptics](http://freethoughtblogs.com/blackskeptics) in general and [this piece by Crommunist](http://freethoughtblogs.com/crommunist/2013/04/10/in-bad-faith/) in particular.**PZ**PZ writes on Amina specifically [once](http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2013/04/04/free-amina/) and does well enough. He links to Maryam Nemazie's blog, which fulfills the prime rule of allyship. However, he has written [several](http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2013/04/03/both-wrong-both-right/) [articles](http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2013/04/08/head-and-heart-atheists/) dismissing Islamophobia as a prominent thing, all the while ignoring the racism that was prevalent in the protests. Which is relevant to the discussion he was having. He breaks the last rule of allyship - don't elide racism from a relevant discussion. Say it first and say it loud.He also becomes perpetrator, surpassing elision. In the [first](http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2013/04/03/both-wrong-both-right/) of the two linked Islamophobia pieces above he describes Islam as "barbaric" and "primitive". For the sake of this discussion I am going to assume everyone is mature enough to realise that while "Islam is not a race", it is conflated with being Arab in the mainstream consciousness (wrongly, indeed only around [20% of Muslims](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim#Demographics) live in the Middle East). More importantly, Islam is conflated with a more sinister thought ... "not white" (also wrong, there are more Christians in Africa, Asia and South America than *the entire population of Europe and North America combined*). And we all know what "not white" people get called ... primitive and barbaric.We all *know* that our media feeds us a horrendously biased picture of Islam, the go-to enemy of the last decade. We *know* that this creates biases. PZ and many others suggest the brutality of actions in some predominantly Muslim areas are why the go-to phrases for criticising Islam are "primitive and barbaric", despite [similar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_burning#Modern_witch-hunts) [atrocities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_on_female_genital_mutilation#Christianity) being performed by impoverished people the world over. That last page is a very good example of this bias - the Christian section states that FGM occurs in Christian Africa but is "a matter of cultural tradition, unrelated to religious belief'" and the Islam section also says the practice " is mainly derived from culture". Yet who do we associate the "barbaric" practice with? Surprise surprise, the religion thought of as "not white".Also note that is just Christianity. You do not need to go far to find near limitless tales of all other world religions and horrific crimes. Only discussing Islamic crimes over and over is a good way to generate cognitive bias.**OPHELIA**Since the Amina story hit the internet, Ophelia has written 12 posts on the topic of it and/or Muslimah Pride and/or Islamophobia/racism/colonialism. And like PZ, she elides the racism.Literally, in 12 posts, many of which are directly about the Femen protest ([defending it](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/04/of-course-stoning-is-bad-but/)) or the Muslimah Pride counter-protest ([ridiculing it](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/04/awesome-on-a-skateboard/)) she never once mentions the racist actions of *some* Femen members. As a member of the privileged race class being discussed (remember, race and Islam are conflated by almost everyone), it is her damn responsibility to make clear that racism is not acceptable.To be sure, she doesn't pretend racism doesn't exist. She finds [examples of it](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/04/down-in-the-muck/) to write about when it is Muslimah Pride people doing it. Obviously, that is different to when white feminists do it, and requires visibility.She then goes on to [mock claims of racism by Muslims](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/04/muslimah-pride/#more-7592) and goes out of her way to [deny intersectionality in general](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/04/attempting-to-impose-white-western-feminism/). She has this awesomely dissonant position - &gt;"We don’t (listen to all Muslims). We just choose a particular set we want to listen to and then refer to them as “Muslims” and what we’re doing as “listening to Muslims” so that everyone will think we have our finger on the pulse of “the Muslim community.” It’s all bullshit. This particular person was listening to some Muslims who dislike Femen and the protest about Amina’s arrest or kidnapping, and treating them as if they were all Muslims."As opposed to writing multiple pieces characterising the counter-protesters are brainwashed misogyny apologists, even while quoting things like &gt;"It seemed that many other Muslim women across the world agreed with my stance and what followed was a defiant and vocal rejection of Femen’s invitation. Instead of ‘getting naked’ Muslim women from across the world tweeted and uploaded pictures of themselves to Facebook in their hijabs, niqabs, and western attire."Assuming she read that, where is the awareness that some of the protestors are in western attire? Totally excluded from discussion. Her next line was entirely about how these women are subjugating themselves to male clerics.This is the nuance I was talking about above. Ophelia is doing exactly what she describes, selecting a group she wants to listen to and claiming it is all Muslims. It is telling that unlike her commenter, she has chosen *the worst examples* of the counter-protest to make monolithic. Many of the counter-protestors support Amina. Many self-describe as feminist. Many feel that Islamic culture needs to change. Every oppressed group gets this. Feminism is "a bad word" in most settings for example, because the straw-feminist is held as the leading example. And even the people who fulfil those criteria would get (and do deserve) much more nuance than Ophelia provides on this issue.To pretend Islam is a set of rules that starts and stops with [Sharia](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/04/are-sharia-councils-harming-women/) and [FGM](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/04/they-tell-you-that-youre-dirty/) is wrong. Those are just a couple of topics she happened to write about during the period of this debate. Unrelated of course. Also unrelated is that she never chose to write about [Islamic Feminism and Islamic Secularism](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nNSz0rHWRo) (long video link). [Islamic feminism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_feminism) has a long and significant history. I particularly like the quote&gt;"When the British applied their law to Muslims in place of Shariah, as they did in some colonies, the result was to strip married women of the property that Islamic law had always granted them — hardly progress toward equality of the sexes."In many ways Islam was ahead of the west. It is not even unreasonable to suggest that wealthy white women could have seen the relatively better position of women in some parts of the world when western feminism and suffrage began to foment. Further down that page is a discussion on current issues for *Islamic women/feminists*. There is no question that Islamic feminists exist, nor that they are any less brilliant and thoughtful than any other (watch the video above if you disagree with that). So, a bunch of brilliant, thoughtful women's rights activists who have considered Islam *from the inside* and find it compatible with feminism.But it is just dismissed, racism elided, voices silenced in preferece of arguing with straw-Islamists. The picture looks grim.Then Ophelia denies that "white western feminism" is [even a thing](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/04/attempting-to-impose-white-western-feminism/) or that feminism is at all altered by a cultural or racial lens. Ophelia, some [Black Feminists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_feminism) wanted a word with you. 40 years ago.Ophelia ticks all the boxes for bad ally. Silencing, eliding, dismissing. She even pops in co-opting by discussing FGM and Sharia *co-incidentally* at the same time as she is arguing that Islam is a nasty woman-hating monolith.**CONCLUSION** (below, ran out of space)
1c9upj	-55294	1365869076	atheismplus	[Resource] Gapminder is awesome! Equality data by religion.	So, just because it is real cool and I have thrown up a few links here recently, Gapminder is a great place that draws population data from numerous world databases and makes it searchable and graphable.[Hans Rosling](http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html) is the brain and face of Gapminder, and gives awesome talks. He has a half dozen at TED.But for us it means we have a ton of data at our fingertips.For example, [here is a graph](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=t1YAVXUoD3iJKy2mSq2Padw;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=tyeSLo9Zpmw_e05IR3EoReg;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=lin;dataMin=0;dataMax=93$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=0;dataMax=23$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) of the **murder rate of women**, with colour coding of countries by religion. In the setting of the recent discussions about Islam, the things to notice are twofold. The top about ten countries are Christian (even the 2 white bubbles as per Wikipedia). The highest Islamic country is at number 15 if I counted right. The entire top 30 contains about 5 Muslim majority countries.The other thing to notice is that there is a strong trend between murder of women and poverty. A few outliers to be sure, but the trend is real.The same relationship between religion and **general murder rate** holds [in general](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=tBrbR3BlR_12WlTIlSTpu6g;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=tZgPgT_sx3VdAuyDxEzenYA;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=lin;dataMin=0;dataMax=98$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=0;dataMax=131$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) although the poverty correlation is weak.Of course, there is other data that is relevant. **Female literacy** [lags in the impoverished Muslim majority countries](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=0AkBd6lyS3EmpdE8xR0dUWDI4ME02SjQ5bi1NYnFHN0E;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=282;dataMax=119849$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=24;dataMax=115$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) slightly more than Christian or "Eastern Religion" majority countries.**Fertility rates** [are relatively evenly spread](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0TAlJeCEzcGQ;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=282;dataMax=119849$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=0.79;dataMax=9.2$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) by religion and directly correlate to poverty levels, and [even more closely](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=0ArfEDsV3bBwCcGhBd2NOQVZ1eWowNVpSNjl1c3lRSWc;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0TAlJeCEzcGQ;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=1.8;dataMax=682$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=0.79;dataMax=9.2$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) to **child mortality levels**.I remember some talk recently of Islam in some areas being against **vaccination** (well, because the US used a fake vaccination program to find out where Osama bin Laden lived in Pakistan). But is it true that Muslim majority countries vaccinate less? [Nope](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=txVTyScWObTBNuMmkNtLh1w;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=282;dataMax=119849$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=0;dataMax=99$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=).Female foeticide is a big problem in highly patriarchal societies, perhaps **gender ratios of children** it could be a decent indicator of gender conflict?

Also surprisingly, **age at first marriage for women** is [pretty even](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=t4eF8H_jq_xyKCUHAX6VT1g;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=282;dataMax=119849$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=13;dataMax=34$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) across religions. A few more Muslim majority nations right down the bottom end, but there is almost no difference.**Whether women work** [does show a significant difference](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=rOXvRa2ZC2oXqBn7gz62IMg;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=282;dataMax=119849$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=7.8;dataMax=86$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=), the lowest rates are almost exclusively in Muslim majority countries.The one thing I can think of that it doesn't have that I really wish it did was wealth per person and wealth by gender.I'm keeping this post as a go to for data on religion and various social indicators. Hopefully useful, and remember - Gapminder is awesome!

1cse7y	-55294	1366525913	atheismplus	TIL - Iran has the second highest rate of sex-change operations in the world, supported by Khomeini.	So, it is accepted in [Iranian Islam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transsexuality_in_Iran#Contemporary_status) (decreed in Fatwa by two Supreme Leaders) that transgender people are innately the gender they experience, and the Iranian government pays for half their sexual reassignment operations, both for transgender men and women.Post-operatively they can marry into a heterosexual relationship legally.At the same time it is one of the worst countries in the world to be gay, with the death penalty for homosexual acts. So some of the gender-reassignment surgery is for gay people who see it as the "least worst" option. It is considered a "cure for homosexuality" by some.It also excludes non-binary gender identified people.Further, the post-operative people are recommended to keep their history private, because the society is actually more prejudiced than the clerics on this issue. It is common for transgender people to be disowned by their families.There is a documentary made about this called ["Be Like Others"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Like_Others), I haven't watched it yet but am planning to, well received.I don't really know how to feel about this, some of it is awfully problematic but some of it is pretty amazing. Traditional culture (the acceptance of a select group of non-binary people or [Mukhannathun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukhannathun#Gender.2Fsexuality) in historical Iran/ME) plays such a strong role in what is accepted, like with the acceptance of [Kathoey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathoey) in Thailand. I hadn't seen it this integrated into religion before. edit: There is a thorough overview of the situation in Iran which is a bit difficult to read due to academic language available [here](http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4905099/NajmabadiPaperFinal2.pdf?sequence=2) - warning: pdf.

Essentially she has written a series of blogposts about how Islam is responsible for the beheading and Islamophobia is not real, eliding the fact mosques are being firebombed across Britain.If that isn't because of an irrational hatred of Muslims I don't know what is.I have replied to [her latest piece](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/05/not-a-merely-inner-struggle/) thusly:&gt;*“If the Muslim leadership did denounce armed jihad, think what a blow it would be against “Islamophobia.””* (from Ophelia)&gt;You may remember a recent conversation between David Silverman and Justin Vacula … you must because you reposted it. In that discussion, the driving force of the point you supported was “when people who ally with you on a particular issue do bad things, silence is complicity.” You agree with that assessment right?&gt;So, much like the original posts about Topless Jihad, you have now made several posts about how Islam is at least partially responsible for the beheading. In fact, you specifically state that “this incident (should change) how people view Islam.” It seems in Britain a lot of people agree with you.&gt;I note that a number of people who agree with you [have done bad things.] (http://www.kentnews.co.uk/news/attack_on_mosque_in_gillingham_follows_woolwich_street_murder_1_2206737 for example)&gt;Yet, in a run of posts, not only do you never mention these acts, you go out of your way to suggest that Islamophobia is not a thing. As you did with FEMEN in the face of clear racism during the protests. Do you truly think that mosque was attacked for a reason other than an irrational hatred of Muslims?&gt;As Dave Silverman has so clearly pointed out in social justice as a person of the privileged group, silence about allies behaving badly is complicity. What you are doing here is worse than silence, it is willfully ignoring the proof that bigots do discriminate against Islamic people.I doubt I will get a response (she hasn't responded before) but I just thought I would post this here too.

I have actually been quite on board with more RC stuff recently than in the early days, but there were a few points he made in this post and in the comments that really seemed dubious.I was trying to point out that the assumed sexual availability of transwomen was exemplified in several of his statements, such as comment 1.1 "All the best are gay". It is a lot of reading if you take his post and the linked post on object/subjectification, but if anyone had thoughts on the discussion I would love to hear them.

I am determined to price carbon."The day before the election The Australian (who was hardly defending her) ran [this story](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/julia-gillards-carbon-price-promise/story-fn59niix-1225907522983), and I will draw you attention to the lede, which was not buried.&gt;"I don't rule out the possibility of legislating a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, a market-based mechanism," she said of the next parliament.

Did he use the turner then to return 6hrs into the past, or did he recieve a message from up to six hours in the future?In favour of going to the past:He guarded the door for 6 hours, ensuring he would have the room to himself. For this to make sense, he must have a specific plan to do *something* to Hermione's corpse, presumably to preserve it.In favour of receiving a future message:He came out just as upset as when he went in. He doesn't *know* that Hermione is safe. If he had her transfigured brain in his pocket, he shouldn't be so unfocussed.Thoughts?

1l8ps5	-55294	1377666834	australia	Can someone explain the public service cuts saving $5.2B? It doesn't add up.	Just trying to get this straight in my head.5.2 billion/12000 jobs = &gt;$100k per year salary. So far, pretty close, the average wage is somewhere between 80 and 90k for a public servant. Lop a few extra heads at the top and it might even add up.But...They are not sacking people. They are using "natural attrition" to cut the numbers of public servants over the forward estimates.Natural attrition without incentives (which have not been suggested or funded) is a linear process. Which means it will take the entire next term of government to achieve those number reductions. If the attrition rate is 12k per 4 years, then the savings number implies an average wage for those let go of *more than 200k/yr*.And that stretches credulity.So either they are expecting only Department Executives and above to quit, or the attrition rate is far higher than 3k/yr (more like 12k/first day!), or they are cutting more jobs, or they are not saving the money.Can someone help me out with the maths?

1lddad	-55294	1377825545	australia	The LNP plans represent significant redistribution from poor to rich. Can we calculate the policy costs?	Yesterday in response to that awful meme about parental leave, I added up the policy costs for mothers (and families) on minimum wage, and was shocked to find that the combination of tax changes, schoolkids bonus and PPL *actually redistributes money from poor people to rich people*.The numbers [are here](http://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1lbh0v/coalitions_parental_leave_scheme_or_a_good_excuse/cbxmhh7), but the take-home is**MUM ON MINIMUM WAGE:**&gt;$12300-15800 (or more) worse off over the course of their child's schooling**MUM ON $150000+:**&gt;$75000 better offIn other words, taking money from 5-6 poor women (or family), and giving it directly to a rich woman (or family).Now, this is only taking the particular policies mentioned into account. Every other policy I can think of by the LNP is "even-handed" in distributing money (like removing the carbon tax - it affects everyone who spends money).The end result would be making poor people poorer, and rich people richer.A QUESTION:Is there any policies that make this number worse, or better? If there is nothing that makes it better, why are Australians not going *fucking mental* about such regressive redistribution? No matter what position on the political spectrum you fall, I can't imagine any Australian being comfortable with taking money from families on the minimum wage to fund millionaires.

If Turnbull goes and is replaced with a headkicker who doesn't understand the internet, then the jig is already up. We *need* the Coalition to know this is already a problem for them.2. There is a small chance that the ALP will fold in the senate and let the Coalition with their "mandate" rip it up before the senate changeover in July next year. We *need* to let the ALP know that this issue has massive support, and that they need to stick to their guns.These are very short term concerns, but we could lose before we start here so it is important.

At the bottom of [the article](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-10/university-student-petition-to-scrap-nbn-takes-off-online/4949372) is the request&gt;Know more? Contact investigations@abc.net.auThey obviously want more out of this, we should put together a submission for them. Sortius, you already have a name with the media ... maybe we should send them something through you? Or anyone else who would be appropriate.So ideas for what to tell them at this early stage? My thoughts: 1. They want narrative. Explain how the movement arose in multiple places at once (change.org, reddit, whirlpool forums) and how twitter and facebook just soaked it up.2. They want to know who is doing it. The next 60 days thread could be used for stories and "average proponent" descriptions.3. They will want to know if we have any "big name" support. Do we? Anyone in business that is recognisable? Any celebs? Anyone from parliament?4. What we want. I would recommend not pushing the "Labor" side of things, but framing it as "we need FTTP", and if they can do that cheaper, fine, but don't skimp on the tech. The telstra quote that VDSL is not the tech of the future is a great one.Other thoughts?

1qg6i8	-55294	1384255146	Futurology	Planning the r/futurology prediction project (aka let's beat Ray)	So, this is just a fun idea for the sub, which [started here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1qce3o/will_all_of_these_future_predictions_come_true/cdbm9ln). The goal is to develop a r/futurology set of predictions about the future based on the massive wealth of knowledge and evidence us internet experts all have. The sub has something similar [in the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/wiki/timeline), but that is languishing and unloved. Most of us would know of several others, like [future timeline](http://www.futuretimeline.net/), but these are spotty and dubious at best.That is because they are *human* predictions. We need superhuman, parahuman, transhuman predictions. A gestalt. The combined knowledge of the r/futurology borganism.So, this thread is for planning how to approach making a solid timeline if that makes sense?My suggestion:1) We create a thread where people can post their favoured technology predictions.2) We agree on a standard description method. I favour (using random example):&gt;**Description**: level 4 (fully automated) self driving cars&gt;**Date first available**: 2015&gt;**Date widely in use**: 2018 in industry. 2020 for consumers.&gt;**Expected stumbling blocks**: Legal hurdles, expect earlier uptake in less regulated regions and areas less attached to legacy car companies.3) We **will reference** predictions where-ever possible. Business plans and direct research links favoured over blogs and futurists where available. Each line in the above example is reference-able.4) We upvote the good 'uns, and downvote the rubbish.5) I (or someone else) will collate the top predictions using some arbitrary cut-off depending on the popularity of the idea. Any that clash will be sent to a sudden death cagematch, either a new thread or an online survey.6) We all agree to make this a global thing, and not just about America. Think big! Of course genetic medicine is getting approved in China before the USA. The [BRICS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS) are wealthy, growing, and far less ensnared in cultural inertia. Factor that into the predictions. 7) This will be controversial, but I think it could get unwieldy. I think we should keep the focus relatively narrow, and focus on just technologies that will significantly disrupt or change the world.So, that is my thoughts so far. This thread is the critique the plan and method. Leave the predictions for the next thread.
1qj1wa	-55294	1384340644	Futurology	Futurology Prediction Project - brainstorming thread	The FPP is intended to represent the distilled knowledge of the r/futurology community, generating a gestalt set of predictions that we can hold up against professional futurologists. Can we knock Ray Kurzweil off his pedestal with the power of the crowd? Outperform the portfolio predictions of Steve Jurvetson? The earlier thread explaining the general process can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1qg6i8/planning_the_rfuturology_prediction_project_aka/)This needs to be broken down into chunks to prevent unwieldy thread of death problems, so the first step will be to generate a set of technologies we can predict about. **THE RULES OF THIS THREAD**&gt;1. Top level comments are *only* for technologies. All children can be about any refining or arguments/discussion&gt;2. Check the other top level comments before posting yours. If they are slightly different, that is cool, post it. We will decide afterwards how to combine it all. But don't just repeat everyone else.&gt;3. Upvote each and every technology you think deserves the Futurology Prediction treatment. &gt;4. Downvote any technology you think is inappropriate. Your reasons could include (but are not limited to): the technology is silly or impossible, the technology is pointless, the technology is unlikely to make a difference to the world, the technology already exists and so on.&gt;5. After an arbitrary amount of time (ie when interest dies down) I or someone else will cull out the major topics and we can all start the prediction thread.&gt;6. Ideally, most of the technology will be in the near future, so we can actually find out how we did while Reddit still exists (Reddit disappearing would be a good topic actually!). But don't limit yourself to the near future. Anything up to a Singularity is fair game. After a Singularity even, if you want to define a set of things we cannot achieve without superintelligence, but should otherwise be achievable.&gt;7. Be clear about your definition of the technology. If it has multiple levels or forms, define which one you mean.As you can see, the rules are really open and non-restrictive. The goal is to get an relatively unbiased look at the community opinion rather than a few expert's ideas on the topics.So, have at it!**EDIT**: I should be clear, this thread is *not* for the predictions themselves, just for brainstorming things to predict about. If you have any idea just chuck it in the ring. A number of low hanging fruit remain, although _trendspotter seems to have had a burst of energy!As an update, I will leave this thread open for at least 24 hours longer, so get upvoting/downvoting to help decide what we should be considering.**UPDATE 2**I will start gathering the tech suggestions today (the 15th). Be sure to up and downvote to decide what will go into the prediction thread.We have a LOT of tech offerings now, I think it will need to be heavily culled just to make the final predicting thread manageable. I doubt many people will be bothered going through a list of a few hundred technologies, and the goal is to get as many people involved as possible.Anyone who has advice on how many to select from the top of the voting pile, PM me or go to the original planning thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1qg6i8/planning_the_rfuturology_prediction_project_aka/)**FINAL UPDATE:**This thread has finished. Head to the final [predictions thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1qqe0m/futurology_prediction_project_insert_predictions/) to get involved with the augeristic prognostications. To any mods who see this, if you could unsticky this thread and sticky that one, I would be much obliged.

It is time to make our predictions.I have culled the top ranked technologies and social changes from the previous thread (all ranked above 5 upvotes). There are around 40 in total, which I think is probably the limit of what we will be able to manage.I have also modified several of the predictions slightly for clarity. If you go to the previous thread you will see I queried several authors about the intent of their offerings.**THE RULES FOR THIS THREAD**&gt;1. Top level comments are for technologies only. Since I am transcribing these from the other thread **don't use top level comments**. Also, there is not much point upvoting and downvoting the top level comments. Save your karma.&gt;2. Each prediction should state a defined time or time range if appropriate. If you do not think it is possible in the near future, a comment like "not in the next 50 years" is acceptable.&gt;3. Upvote the prediction you most agree with. Downvote the ones you disagree with.&gt;4. Since you are trying to convince the audience your prediction is right, provide evidence for your assertions. A non-referenced prediction should be treated with suspicion.&gt;5. Do get involved. This is a big community, we need to use that for the project to succeed. We need you!&gt;6. Remember the weakness of collective intelligence is [groupthink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink). If you disagree with a prediction, make sure you say it! The more discussion and evidence used to support arguments, the better.&gt;7. Play nice. Play the argument, not the person.&gt;8. Publicise the project. The more people the better. Mention it in other subreddits, on forums, on blogs, or even to your meatfriends.&gt;9. **DO** imagine each prediction to be uttered by a [world-spanning borg-mind](http://project-apollo.net/mos/img/char-mars.jpg). Now, where is my vectored air-shield?**THE AFTERMATH**The plan will be to keep this thread going for as long as it needs and people are still interacting. Once complete I suspect we can plug the info straight into the futurology wiki [timeline](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/wiki/timeline), but developing some nice visualisations/infographics etc. would be cool too. The results will be freely available for anyone to do what they want with.**RESOURCES**/r/futurology is your best resource.

Try to be as specific as you can, the point is to use the best data to *accurately* predict the timeline of the future.A few people have posted new technologies in top level comments. While it is against the rules, if they get upvoted enough I am happy to accept them. If they are silly, downvoted them to oblivion.Remember to vote! And if you downvote (which you should), try to have a think about whether you could do a better estimate. If so, add to the conversation as well!**EDIT 2**Well, we had a good turnout. I will collate the data when I return home in a few days. Anyone who wants to address the currently unspecified elements, feel free to do so still.

24emm2	-55294	1398896277	BasicIncome	An alternate way to fund UBI?	The FAQ lists a bunch of possible ways to fund a UBI, but I was just thinking of alternatives that could potentially grab more of the political spectrum (ie. mainly the right) than "increased taxes".I had the random idea of a supercharged estate tax. 100%. Everything a person has saved or owns transfers to the government at the time of death.Every person gets given the same resources (ie a UBI), no-one has an unfair advantage by sheer luck of which family they were born into (beyond the resources the living parents/relatives may have obtained), and 100% of the wealth of the society goes into government coffers to fund a UBI/social services.**Benefits:**1) efficiency. No income taxes, no business taxes, nothing to really manage except the estate tax (+/- supplementary measures)2) disrupting the whole baby boomer bubble and turning it into a positive, the more old people, the more money coming through as deceased estates.3) incredibly progressive, but does not "disincentivise work", if that is a thing people believe.4) completely breaks inequality at the source - the dynastic accumulation of wealth is over.5) politics! UBI without taxation during life? Get that monkey off your back!!!6) massive revenue stream for services.**Negatives:**a) efficiency. Does it then come down to the government to sell all deceased assets? This is vastly less efficient than individuals making use of those assets, presumably.b) offshoring and asset hiding. Rich people would try and hide assets for their kids. Maybe extreme punishments could mitigate this to some extent. If it was a big problem a consumption tax might help.**Uncertain:**x) how to deal with spouses - obviously a spouse should keep the wealth during life but would that result in money marriages?y) how would it affect aggregate demand? I feel like it might increase it, but not sure.Just a random thought. Terrible idea? Workable? And would it achieve the goal of seducing the unconvinced?

24gfpk	-55294	1398953520	australia	What the GP co-payment is actually about ... probably.	The media has been covering this a lot, but I haven't actually seen a great deal of in-depth assessment of what this co-payment business is about, and what it is meant to do.What is proposed is a 5-15 dollar fee paid when a patient is bulk billed. What is bizarre is that this payment goes directly to the GP, the government is not involved.This is meant to save the government money by stopping people going to the doctor as much. Even if we accept that it will work, and even if we accept it as a worthwhile, it is a weird approach to take.1) It is a transfer of money from poor directly to rich. No middleman to funnel that money back into services, the doctor can just chuck it in the bank or whatever.2) It is direct involvement by government in price setting, which is really strange. I can't think of any other situation where the government *requires* a service provider to charge more money than necessary without taking the money into government revenue. I don't even know what sort of precedent this sets.3) The government is saying ... they don't *have* to charge it? But they would like it if they did? WTF? So, the doctors who do charge it are responsible for the cost to patients for this brainfart? That won't disrupt the doctor patient relationship at all.4) Most importantly, a doctor currently *receives* $9 from Medicare when a patient is bulk-billed. This "co-payment" is transparently a prelude to removing that incentive to bulk-bill, since the doctors already have "the option" to charge bulkbilled patients, amirite? Even though they already had that option, it was called *not bulk-billing a patient*. It is a very strange system, which is probably going to result in a disincentive to bulk-bill, set a precedent for the government getting directly involved in price-setting in a novel way, and create an antagonistic system between doctors and patients.

I follow SENS pretty avidly, and watch most of the videos of AdG I come across, but I have noticed that as compared to a few years ago, there is a lot of silence from the labs.For a while whenever Aubrey did a talk he would mention an experiment which had broken new ground (thinking specifically of the lysoSENS stuff) and was publishing new results.Since then (2012/13) I haven't seen any mention of new results, or new papers. The only thing on the SENS research blog is a slow publishing of the 2013 SENS report, chapter by chapter, when the report was rehashing the research done in the previous years anyway.What have I missed? Is there new research that has been published, or is about to be? Is there more work happening in partnered labs but not directly under SENS management that I haven't come across?Are there any updates on in vivo experiments for lysosomal modification trials? Or did they hit some roadblocks?Funding has skyrocketed in the last couple of years, mainly due to Aubrey himself, so what has actually been happening?

I found it because I was intrigued by the new webservice Forekast.com (the group that did that "coming up this week in science and technology" post a few days back) and was looking around for something to post there.Been watching it on and off since, you can find the livestream and already finished videos [here](http://new.livestream.com/TEDMED/stage2014). The videos are currently in huge blocks, and it is almost impossible to work out what each talk will be about, I thought I would let you know what I have seen so far that caught my attention. The lectures I don't mention may still be interesting, but don't really seem /r/futurology or that new.Most importantly - who the hell picked their font for speaker titles? That is ugly. Really ugly.**Lecture Block 1 "Turn it Upside Down"**1. E Bimla @ 44 minutes, discussing the research that shows breastfeeding protects mothers against heart disease. Not really futurology relevant, but interesting nonetheless.**Lecture Block 2 "We Just Don't Know"**1. Jeff Iliff @ 1hr, talking about the new evidence that sleep clears extracellular junk from the brain, and the likely role in Alzheimer's disease. This is very related to some of the SENS work and other drug campanies re: beta amyloid aggregates.2. Gary Conkright  @ 1hr, 22 minutes, talking about ubiquitous medical sensors and big data medicine.**Lecture Block 3 "Flat Out Amazing"**1. Francis Collins @ 43mins. Overview on upcoming medical advances.2. Marc Koska @ 1hr 26mins. A talk about the benefits of self-breaking syringes (so they can't be reused). Good reminder that technology without social understanding of the market is not enough, and can create problems. Also reminds us that technology can solve those problems, even where social safety systems (like telling people not to reuse syringes, and education, and monitoring etc) fail. 3. Foteini Agrafioti @ 1hr 42mins. Talks about using ECG as a biometric, apparently as unique as a fingerprint. Seems like an unwieldy idea to me, but if we have always on sensors anyway there is no reason to not use the data.More reviews upcoming.

One of my primary researchers is a prominent statistician, but I would love to have some idea of what I need before I go to him (and take up his valuable time).Essentially in the research we will measure multiple variables and use GWAS (genome wide association study) techniques to associate these results to a single clinical outcome (in this case a time-to-event outcome).I know a minimum bound for my hazard ratio (no less than 3, probably more than 5), I know I can find a reasonable number of patients (hundreds to thousands). Because we are using GWAS techniques there is an issue of false positive associations, so p-value as low as possible is beneficial (GWAS standard is p = 5x10^-8, but the ORs are much lower generally, usually &lt;1.5)The problem is that we am using untested and somewhat inaccurate measurements for our variables, and they will only partially reflect the "true" measurements that could be obtained. I need to find a margin of acceptable error for my measurements which still results in statistically significant associations.ie if measure A is 95% accurate, with a cohort of 300, associations with HR 3 will be detected x% of the time. If measure B is 99% accurate etc.Thanks for any assistance, even just a pointing in the right direction would be cool (I know basic stats to the level of maybe a year of undergraduate class).

2xz2qo	-55294	1425519704	HPMOR	[Spoilers 116] Something is fishy.	The only hypothesis that makes sense to me is that this was all a plot by QQ to achieve his goals. There is *mountains* of evidence to support the theory, which I will add in below. Against the hypothesis is that there are only 5 chapters left, and it would be total mood/thematic whiplash at this point to close off such a twisted plot in that short space. This completely torpedoes the hypothesis in my mind, but then I find the story makes no sense.Evidence for plot:1) For events to be taken at face value Voldemort must be the "real" Professor Quirrell. Quirrell previously said in parseltongue that he was planning for Harry to defeat Voldemort. This is pretty much conclusive in my mind that Voldemort was not the ground truth of Quirrell, but just another character that he was willing to retire if needed.2) Quirrell had openly stated he would have two houses win the House cup, and remove the snitch from Quidditch. Chapter 116 shows that the snitch was never going to be removed *unless* he could perform some ridiculous social engineering. Like, say, making Quirrell a posthumous hero at the exact time Quidditch rule changes were on the table.3) Hermione is resurrected, which is only necessary to QQ if Harry needs a voice of reason (ie if he is alive). Hermione is also being set up as the girl-who-lived, a Muggleborn no less. And she will be given enough points to tie the House cup, in respect for Quirrell's sacrifice.4) Quirrell showed Harry a whole bunch of Interdicted magic, including resurrection.5) Harry now has no political opposition. The blood purists are dead and there is a Light side power vacuum with Dumbledore trapped.6) Quirrell already knows you can't prevent a prophesy by killing the subject, which was the reason he did the whole horcrux thing in the first place. 7) Quirrell was smarter than Voldemort, which has actually been explained in story as an intentional hamstringing of the character so Voldemort wouldn't win.I'm sure there is more that I am missing, but it has all the makings of a plot. I remain highly confused by the turn of events that has taken place. Unfortunately, I am pretty sure I am wrong. But I don't understand how I can be wrong.

I walk out of my room to find my kettle pumping out insane amounts of steam and the smell of burn grains. My roommate had set a pot of water on the stove to boil for noodles and instead of turning on the back burner, he turns the front one from medium to high. When I poured the mash out there was a nice black cake of chard grit remains at the bottom. Luckily it only cost me $2.39 for more grits and i have some dry malt extract up my sleeve to correct the gravity for my lost grains since the brew store was closed, but it set me back 1 and a 1/2 hours. :(

I was going to add the spice after I separated the beer. the other possibility is taking out a section of wort and boiling it on the side then adding it back in. Do the spices need to bind to the wort or something.Thanks

The best I've been able to get is in the storage setting it flashes for about a second that something is there and then goes away.  Ultimately I'm trying to use it for the snes and n64 emulators, and XBMC, but I can't get the Ouya to recognize anything in the USB port.  What am I doing wrong?

My question, is this soldier named after [Brian Bendis] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Michael_Bendis)?   I only make this connection because he writes comic books and could have worked with Joss while he wrote X-men.  It's just an uncommon name and I thought it might be a fun little Easter egg.

Just watched Captain America: Winter Soldier and I have a thought about Nick Fury's real intentions when it comes to Phil Coulson.  Phil's death in The Avengers provided Nick Fury the perfect opportunity to test an experimental drug SHIELD was developing.  Nick used the drug on Phil to see if it worked as a fail safe for himself, in case anyone ever successfully killed him.  And it worked extremely well in bringing Phil back from the dead.  Nick put Phil back in the field in Agents of Shield to see what the limits of the drug are and if there are any side effects.  Which, maybe, who Malinda May is reporting to, but we won't know for that for sure yet.  It's not that Phil is Nick's favorite agent, it's that he's his fail safe/field test.  Also that's why Nick Fury himself showed up at the end of the third episode of AoS, because he wanted to personally check on Coulson to see if it were any negative reaction to the drug.  And if his judgement was clouded by bringing Skye aboard his team.  I/we still don't know for sure what the blue creature was in the tube in Agents of Shield was in any certainty.  However in the post credits scene in the very first Iron Man, Nick told Tony he'd "become part of a bigger universe..." which leaves a lot of possibilities for Shield to know about.  From what we know Nick Fury is always multiple steps ahead of everyone.  That's all I got, but as a side note I'm betting Zola is the Clairvoyant in AoS, but that's just a guess.TL;DR: Phil Coulson is Nick fury's fail safe for death.

2j7lnv	-55297	1413290112	CarAV	Looking for help and have a unique problem.	So here's the deal, I have a 2003 Ford Crown Victoria.  The FM side on the radio has basically stopped working and I'm out of ideas.  The specifics of what it's doing, FM is pretty much static and noise however sometimes the signal comes back for a second or two but on the wrong frequency.  For example, I would be 97.1 and my display would say 97.1 however the signal would be from 94.7.  Other times the radio works perfectly fine like nothing's wrong.  I haven't noticed a pattern.  AM works without any problems.  Here's what I've tried.  My neighbor is an electrical engineer, he connected a basic antenna to the back of the radio and the problems still persist, so we don't think it's the antenna.  I bought the exact same make and model radio and replaced it and FM problems were still there and now AM didn't work at all.  I am hesitate to buy and new radio because I don't thing it will fix my problem.  So that's my issue any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated.TL;DRFM doesn't work and I don't think it's the antenna.  Also tried a replacement radio and that didn't help

1trx26	-55312	1388107317	dayz	Please add militar loot and camps up north	As it stands right now Balota is the hotspot and there isnt any reason to leave the coast after you are all geared up. All the action is at balota and along the southern coast line because there isnt any incentive to go up north because the Stary Sober hot spot is now gone. Please add more military buildings to places like Stary Sober, Gorka and kabinino to increase the amount of PVP up north. and decrease the redicoulus death matching down south.EDIT: The amount of action near the center of the map seems to low for all the gear is in the south western part of the map. People ghost loot and inevitably stay around the southern part of cherno. Please help disperse some of the action from the south western part of the map by moving or creating new military bases around the middle of the map like Stary and Novy Sober.
1tu70q	-55312	1388185635	dayz	[SUGGESTION] Possible ways of stopping server hopping for loot!	I have been thinking of a way to fix the increase of loot by server hopping that a lot of player do.1: Private hives, seems like a crappy fix but it will keep people in 1 server2: Loot Timer, currently it seems there is no loot timer so there is a massive insentive to server hope for loot because of the lack of it. Adding a loot timer will dispense loot evenly and fairly throughout a server and give people a reason to stay on a high pop. server.3: Allow a maximum of 3 servers to be joined every 30 minutes (ONLY PUBLIC HIVE), This solution to me seems the fairest because there isnt a reason to be hopping multiple public servers except to be findng loot which this has a chance to stop. Do you really know anyone so dedicated to their M4 they will server hope every half hour for loot in 1 spot, I dont know anyone like that4: Remove the military base at balota and put it at stary, This might help server hopping for the very reason if you walk 5k to stary sober and start sober more than likely other people will be server hopping to and will be more desperate for loot after walking 5k than spawning at balota and walking .5k. People will start to farm the server hoppers for loot making it incredibly more risky to server hop possibly balancing itself out.There are my ideas for sopping server hopping, please edit or add your own ideas to this list.

1tzn66	-55312	1388375627	dayz	Possible fix for FOV cheating.	Right now in DayZ when you crank up your FOV to the minimum and hold RMB you can see at sniper distance. My idea to decrease this cheating is make it so your character can not zoom in to an FOV that goes below the current minimum FOV allowed in options. Keep the current FOV change when ADS but add in 1 line of code to disallow any decreasing of FOV via zooming in below the already minimum FOV.

1u51bf	-55312	1388549315	dayz	[SUGGESTION] Ability to highlight multiple items and move them.	Right now when you find a better back pack or want to switch something like pants you have to manually move everything in the current item. I suggest allowing player to create a box around the items they want to move and then drag that to the new item. To keep some realism when you do this it will take an algorithmlike Edited Variables:1-2 items = .5s delay 5% chance of damage5-6 items = 1.5s delay 10% chance of damage7-8 items = 2s delay 15% chance of damage...And to further help balance this out doing this has a small chance of hurting the items that are being moved in quantaties and make it so the character is immobilized while the action is happening. This would give the ability of essentialy "dumping" items from 1 piece of clothing to the next which would simulate another real world action done in panic. Any suggestions on this idea or other ways of balancing this?

Crafting a makeup hand mirror a stick and some duck tape to make an object for the use of looking around corners?EDIT: I am not talkin about using this on third person servers for it would be a gigantic waste of time. On first person servers thats where it would be useful. Besides that you wouldn't be able to see much of anything around the corner with the mirror except for right in front of you if you use a small mirror and look at it from 2 feet away.

1uzpni	-55312	1389482376	Battlefield	Please remove spawn protection when...	...Someone spawns on a squadmate It is incredibly annoying shooting at a guy and all of the sudden his buddy spawns in and kills you. Whats even more annoying is when you kill the first guy and his buddy whos protected doesnt get touched by your bullets but you get killed by him. I want spawn protection removed because not only does it mean when a squad of 4 guys spawns on 1 guy and kills you, but it also means that you have no possible chance of defending yourself because they spawned in and you cant shoot em. Dice gave you the ability to see what your squad mate is doing in the little preview window before you spawn and if you spoawn on a mate in a firefight, then its your own damm fault for getting killed by spawning in a stupid location. Although please keep spawnprotection whilst spawning on a bases and radio beacons. Signed, an annoyed Battlefield player TLDR: Keep spawn protection on bases and radio beacons Remove spawn protection while spawning on squadmates.

Most of mine and hubs' gardening experience comes from Zone 9 (TX, CA, but mainly FL.) We're completing a moving from NYC, so we've not had a decent garden in about 5 years, and we are beyond eager to start on one again.  We've been doing a bit of internet browsing, trying to learn as much as we can about what to expect where soil/climate/regional plants/etc are concerned, but I'm wondering what *your* most useful bit of local gardening advice is.

I just found out Monday that I'm knocked up (Surprise! thanks Hubs!) and although we're not telling anyone else yet, I thought I'd share that bit of info with all of you.It's been 5.5 weeks since the first day of my last cycle, and 3.5 weeks since we did the dirty and got knocked up (I love my iphone app for keeping track of this stuff).  I've been taking Folate and prenatals, I've scheduled a meet and greet with a local midwife group for next week, and joined a 'Pregnant Walkers' group on meetup.  While this was an unplanned but happy surprise, I've been educating myself and preparing a bit in advance (we weren't actively trying, but we weren't preventing it either.)We've also just moved from NYC to CO last month, so it's been an adventure all around!  So there you go.  I'm happy to officially be a part of Baby Bumps!EDIT: Changed 'thread' to 'sub'.

I'm just curious if anyone else feels relatively normal where their emotions are concerned.I'm 14.5 weeks and my emotions have, thus far, been in check.  The most emotional moment I've experienced so far is getting *a little* teary eyed while listening to a song I've heard a bajillion times.  This has happened 4 or 5 times, and I've never actually cried - just watery eyes.I've experienced plenty of other symptoms (morning sickness is *still* going strong!)... but not this one.  I've been known to be quite emotional while PMSing, so I figured I'd definitely experience it during pregnancy.  It's quite possible that it hasn't kicked in for me yet, and if it never does (yeah right) then yay!
1oofsk	-55324	1382051546	BabyBumps	My trip to the supermarket: Foul followed by funny	**FOUL**So my bladder was at it's max and I almost can't hold it anymore when head to the front restrooms at the grocery store today.  Upon entering I immediately noticed an incredibly foul mess in stall numero uno (seriously, where was that person aiming their anus when they took that watery poo?!) and decided to make a run for the very end stall, banishing any nauseating thoughts of the first stall from my mind.  Well, this would have been a great plan if the stench hadn't crept into my nostrils with the intensity of a smelly frat house on burrito night.  I immediately changed my mind and dashed back towards the door.  Watery eyed and focusing on not puking, the manager and an associate pass by me and ask if I'm ok.  I say yes, but let them know the bathroom is not - it needs some immediate attention.  Bag boy confirms this and apologetically points me towards the store's other restroom.**FUNNY**So I'm standing by the smaller, one-person-at-a-time restroom in the back of the store, waiting patiently for the person in there to GTFO, when another shopper standing nearby strikes up a conversation with me by informing me that the store has another restroom at the front.  I let her know I tried that one, but it was a mess and my persistent morning sickness couldn't stand the smell.  She then gives me her best tip for managing morning sickness - and hey, I'm game.  Nothing has worked yet, so why not see what she has to say, right?  That's when the communication broke down a little....What she said: "You know what's great for morning sickness?  Peanuts.  It got me through mine when I was pregnant."What I heard: "You know what's great for morning sickness?  *Penis*. It got me through mine when I was pregnant."My first reaction was to think "Penis?  I'm pretty sure that's what got me into this mess in the first place - I'm not sure how it'll help with the morning sickness, but ok. Whatever floats your boat/works, I guess."  It took me a full minute to realize that she didn't say *penis*, she just didn't enunciate the word *peanuts*.  By this time I'm just dying... my bladder is about to burst and I'm not sure how long I can keep this conversation up, despite her purely good intentions, so I just responded politely and thanked her for the recommendation.  Then the restroom occupant vacated the space I so desired and with that my tale came to an end.I hope this is as funny to you all as it was when it happened.TL;DR: Always enunciate when saying the word *peanuts*
1p5m28	-55324	1382655122	NaturalPregnancy	Those of you seeing midwives in a rotating practice, how are getting to know each of the midwives?	This applies to the lovely ladies in a rotating OB practice as well.It occurred to me the other day that one important element I was failing to incorporate into my appointments was to try and get to know the midwife I was seeing that day a little better in anticipation of the possibility that maybe, just maybe, *this* midwife will be the one on-call the day/night I go into labor.  Luckily, I realized this with plenty of time to go, but I'm still amazed this didn't occur to me until recently.  Now, I plan to include lots of small talk and more than just the usual questions when I see the next midwife, but I'd still like to know what the rest of you gals are doing/talking about with yours.  My goal is to feel comfortable enough with any of them being the midwife present when I'm in labor (obviously).So, how are you taking the time to familiarize yourself and get comfortable with the different midwives/OBs at each of your visits?  Are you creating conversations that extend past routine medical/pregnancy topics in an effort to get to know the woman behind the title?

2bmohj	-55332	1406234955	AskHistorians	At what point would an outside observer have begun to make a distinction between Judaism and Christianity?	From what I understand about the topic, Christianity began as an offshoot of the Jewish Abrahamic religion that held the rabbi Jesus to be a messiah sent from god. This by itself is not unique, however, because many other jews from the time period and since have been so acclaimed, ex: [Messiahs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Messiah_claimants).My question is: when (and for what reasons) did it become to be clear to an ordinary Roman pagan for example that a group of ordinary Jews and a group of Christians were distinct and unrelated? Did this become evident once the church had formed its own self-appointed power structure of priests, bishops, patriarchates, etc.? For any church scholars, what were the major turning points in christian theology in particular that separated it from mainstream Jewish theology and who made those contributions?

1a9dv4	-55349	1363228730	pharmacy	What are your thoughts on over-the-counter syringe sales?	New Jersey passed a law in the past year or so in which patients are allowed to purchase up to 10 syringes without a prescription.  As far as I can tell, similar laws have been in effect in other states for a while now.  I work in community pharmacy and have been dispensing a decent number of these syringes lately, along with safe disposal information.  I don't know what each state law calls for, but do any of you do any type of screening, ID checks, or documentation before selling syringes over the counter?  Would you sell them if you suspected or knew that they were being used for illicit drug use?  I would appreciate any input as all of this is relatively new to me.  Thanks!

I bought a compost bin ([this model](http://www.amazon.com/Soilsaver-Classic-Composter/dp/B003959G9Y/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1377118202&amp;sr=8-12&amp;keywords=compost)) and started putting in leaves, grass clippings, food scraps, etc.  About a month ago or so, my dad was turning the pile with a pitchfork, got stung by a bunch of bees, and had a bad reaction.  We have no idea whether they are yellow jackets or honey bees or what have you (they are not the fat fuzzy ones [are those bumblebees?]).  Our compost pile is starting to smell funny because we are unable to turn it for fear of the bees.  What should I do?  Thanks for your help!EDIT: Consensus seems to be yellow jackets so I guess I will wait it out until winter.  Thanks for your help, everyone! :)

(US only)	EDIT: ALL GONE, SORRY :(Hi everyone,I have a bunch of points on a rewards account which can be redeemed for magazines, but I don't really have any interest in the magazines being offered.  If you'd like a subscription for Brides magazine (8 issues, I believe they are monthly), PM me your name and address and I can sign you up for it.  I have enough points to give away 10 subscriptions.  (Mods, please remove this post if this is against the rules)I promise I am not a psycho stalker, but obviously use your judgment since you're sending your name and address to a random person on the Internet.  Also, for full disclosure, the rewards account is through RewardSurvey, and I can't vouch for whether or not they sell the addresses, etc.  I did sign myself up for a subscription and I can't say I've gotten more spam in my mail since then, but keep that in mind.For those of you who haven't flipped through an issue of Brides magazine, admittedly it is mostly advertisements, but there are lots of pictures that can provide ideas, especially early on in planning.

32rbpu	-55349	1429150490	weddingplanning	[RANT] Weddington Way has messed up my order four times now	Long post ahead:BACKGROUND: We placed an order for two of our bridesmaids' dresses on December 2nd in order to take advantage of the 15% off Black Friday deal that Weddington Way was offering.  Less than 24 hours from the time that the order was placed (within their change/cancellation policy), we e-mailed them to ask them to kindly change the color of the dress (from cobalt to navy).  We received an e-mail back stating that the change had been successfully made.  However, being thorough, we checked the status on the website the following day and found that only the top of the dress had been changed to navy, but the bottom of the dress remained in cobalt.  We e-mailed them again and were assured in writing that they would make the change.ISSUE #1: On January 15th, we received one of the two dresses.  The top half was navy, while the bottom half was cobalt.  I quickly called Weddington Way, where the agent apologized to me and promptly sent me a return label to send the dress back, and said they would have a replacement dress sent to me.  I asked about the status of the second dress, and she stated that since it had not yet entered production, they would be able to make the change to the second dress so it would arrive correctly.ISSUE #2: On March 4th, I received the second dress and it was also wrong, despite the fact that they told me it would be corrected before it entered production.  I called them again and was sent another shipping label to return the dress.  I also asked about the status of dress #1, and was told that there would be an estimated ship date of April 1st.ISSUE #3: On March 19th, I received another dress that was also half navy and half cobalt.  At this point I was getting pretty upset.  I called them and was told that the shipping department had thought it was a "return to sender" situation, so they had received it and sent it right back to the same address.  So this was the same exact dress I had just sent back a few weeks before.ISSUE #4: Around April 1st (don't remember exact date), I received both dresses.  I looked at them and they were the correct color.  Yay!  Tonight (April 15th) I finally had a chance to meet with my bridesmaids to give them the dresses, and we realized that they had messed up the style number on one of the dresses... I am a fairly laid back person so I was thinking that as long as it's the right color it would be okay, but the style they sent is Alfred Angelo 7265S... I understand that everyone's taste is different, but that style just looks weird to me.I just sent them another e-mail tonight asking/demanding that they send me the correct dress by May 31st (wedding is on June 27th).  We'll see what they say tomorrow... argh!  So frustrating :(

Not only did they not fix my unit, they actually gave me a different 3DS because the Zelda one wasn't available. I would have never expected that I would have my 3DS STOLEN from an OFFICIAL Nintendo repair. I'm on the phone right now, this is outrageous.

17tsuz	-55360	1359927709	cheatatmathhomework	Verifying by Substitution and solving Initial Value Problems[Differential Equations]	I have two problems I am having trouble with. The instructions are to verify by substitution and then solve the IVP.1) y'+3x^2 y=0, y(x)= Ce^(-x^3 ), y(0)=10    So y'=-3x^2 Ce^(-x^3) which when I plug it in turns out fine. So I have verified that y(x) is a solution.Now for the IVP.y'+3x^2 y=0 y=-y'/3x^2y=-[-3x^2 Ce^(-x^3 )]/ 3x^2y=Ce^(-x^3) y(0)= Ce^(0)= 10 C=10 The answer in the back of the book is C=72) y'=3x^2 (y^2 +1), y(x)=tan(x^3 +C)So y'= 3x^2 sec^2 (x^3 +C) which should equal 3x^2 (y^2 +1), but I'm having trouble showing this. I don't have any trouble with the IVP for this one. Thanks!

2y2a42	-55364	1425589173	paydaytheheist	Can we take a moment to appreciate everything Overkill have done in the past five months?	I see so many comments saying Overkill don't put effort into their content and other similar nonsense. I'll start off by reminding everyone that Overkill are a very small studio (about 30 people according to what I could find out), who are still supporting a game which is coming up on being 20 months old. To contrast, there are enormous companies that release much more popular games and barely support them past day one, so I think Overkill deserve a lot of credit for that alone. They know people enjoy their game and they care enough about their fans to continue to make Payday 2 an interesting game more than a year after its release.Now I'd like to show you a list of what Overkill will have released in the FIVE MONTH period between the time the Crimefest event started and the time the Spring Break event will end:* Brass knuckles* Golden AK* Judge gun* Money bundle weapon* Hoxton Breakout contract* Hoxton character pack (which included a new skill tree)* Art Gallery contract* Time of day* John Wick character pack* Perk decks* The Diamond contract* Clover character pack* The Bomb: Forest contract* The Bomb: Dockyard contract* Dragan character pack* More masks, colors, patterns, and materials than I can be bothered to list here* Infamy 2.0* Side jobs* SWAT turret enemy* Car Shop heist* Two more single-day heists* Bonnie character pack* Hoxton Revenge contract* Jacket character pack* Probably some other shit I forgotNow I don't know about any of you, but I'd say that's a pretty impressive list for five months of work from a studio with fewer than 50 employees. Considering all of that, I can gladly excuse the tardiness of the new GenSec enemy, the FBI files and the Golden Grin Casino contract, as well as the somewhat underwhelming nature of the Infamy 2.0 update. Overkill clearly have a lot on their plate with all of these updates, developing Overkill's The Walking Dead, and re-engineering Payday 2 for release on consoles.So please, next time you think about criticizing Overkill because they've done something you don't like, remember that they're a very small, very successful studio which created (in my opinion) one of the greatest games in recent memory. They know a lot more about making games and running a studio than most of you do, so please stop bitching and moaning and trying to be backseat developers.

I knew at that point they we're pretty strong smelling. Not to say murderously noxious, but on a scale of 1 to chloroform knockout. It was about an 8.I had a second bad feeling about this and I looked over to the passenger trapped between me and the window, the poor soul, to get an unlucky random seat by the window, trapped by a glass pane that doesn't open and some odoriferous smell.She did all that she could and just covered her mouth and nose with her hand.I must imagine she pictured herself in the swamps of dagobah reaching for the peppermint oil.I had farted so much volume, she might have insisted it was a hate crime against her had she been jewish.There was no escaping it and she cupped her hands tighter around her face.I was too terrified to even acknowledge it, so I just closed my eyes and pretended to be asleep. I couldn't look her in the eye for the rest of the flight. Which was mercifully short.When the plane docked and everyone stood to leave, she got her revenge.She leaned against a seat opening up her underarms to release the products of her pheromone factories. It may have been the stress from dealing with my farts, but the results we're undeniable. This women had ammo. Lots of ammo.With her arm camp liberated. She was letting it roll.Eventually we got off the plane and I walked as fast as I could to get away from the collective shame of assaulting and being assaulted from smell warfare.TL; DR, I gassed someone who had nowhere to run.

Ive been playing mainly dice servers with randoms but id like for some of you guys to join me this evening, i may even set up a rush playlist on the # 6 if nothing else is happening there.

After i quit the game my internet will temporarily stop working till i reset the modem and/ or wait a minute or two. I currently have 15mbps internet which is fast but its the lowest of the broadband speeds available. I do plan on upgrading to 30 mbps in a day or two for the ps4 BUT Does this have to do with my speeds? Ive tried 2 different wireless routers and thats not the prob, its currently on a nice belkin n+ router. Also want to point out the console is super slow to process, freezes alot is on its last legs and is a pos to be honest. Could this be the issue? Another newer console we had in the house didnt seem to cause this but not certain. This issue is actually with my my roommates console and up till when I sold my console I thought it was happening because we were playing at the same time from two sep. units. But, not the case considering its still happening whenever he quits playing cod. Im open to any input you have on my issue here. please help. thanks

Keep in mind i paid around 100 bucks for my tlr, which normally goes for 140, and the LSI is 190. They gave me credit for the full price of the tlr and used it towards the sale price of the LSI (132$) which put me ahead 8 bucks. I ended up buying a reel with that. So to recap, they upgraded my rod for free and I got a discount on a reel. Just thought id share this awesome experience I just had with cabelas, i can't speak any more highly of the value in their products and their dedication to customer service and warranty issues.

The old woman's voice was full of grief , of fear. "Corpses." Is she referring to the hostages that the Yunkai'i hold ie. Daario Naharis and the others?

Yesterday there was a post about what was your favourite chapter or scene from the books and I remember one that most people really like is where Jon is about to have Janos Slynt executed but then decides to take his fathers approach and asks for a block to be brought forth so he can pass the sentence himself and we all know how satisfying it is to read as Jon removes that frog head from it's shoulders. I'm currently re-reading AGoT and I'm just onto Sansa's chapter directly after Eddards beheading when she attends Joffrey at court for the first time after the incident and she sees Janos on the council and recalls how he had thrown her father: "Sansa stared hard at his ugly face, remembering how he had thrown down her father for Ser Ilyn to behead, wishing she could hurt him, wishing that some hero would throw him down and cut off his head."George R.

Now I do have a decent PC and Battle Chest is on sale for about £4 I thought why not.

1v12cv	-55379	1389534625	dayz	Problems when logging in - Can't equip, move items or interact with things.	Came back to playing after a quick break over Christmas. Whenever I log in there seems to be a large period of time where I can't select or swap weapons or select any item on my toolbar. I can't open doors. Can't move items around in my inventory or bring new items in. If I do try and move an item and then log out, when I come back in it has disappeared. Then, after about 10-15 minutes, my gun makes the multiple reload sounds that it usually made whenever you logged in (game breaking as it pretty much alerts everyone in the area you just logged in and there have been far too many times where I've come in and been straight up killed) and then I can start interacting with things. Obviously this makes the first 15 mins unplayable. But, it isn't just the beginning either. Sometimes it just starts doing it randomly and the desync indicator comes up and when I check my desync it's at 10000. The thing is, I'm on optical fibre, my speeds are always fine and so is my ping whenever I join these servers, usually around 10 - 24ms and it never jumps while I'm in these servers. My rigs fine as well, i5 3570K @4.2GHz with a GTX 660Ti and I'ev put all graphical settings to the lowest despite it being able to run high/medium fine, just in case. I'm also getting a bug where if I've been killed and then I respawn and run back towards my body, suddenly I'll be teleported to where I respawned and I'll be stuck turning unable to do, literally, anything ie. bring up menus or exit, meaning I have to end the process and restart.  So is anyone else having these types of problems?

1yw7sz	-55379	1393339940	darksouls	Bit of a problem with account information with GFWL.	The problem I'm having at the moment is a bit of a nightmare to be honest.  I've been playing Dark Souls over a very long period of time on my PC and recently I've stepped up the play time a little bit.  Over this time period I've always had my account as auto sign-in and I don't use GFWL for anything else so I've come to forget what email is associated with it and seeing as I don't use Windows live accounts for anything and I will have made it purely to be able to use GFWL I can't even guess.  Now I need to swap dark souls onto a new system and obviously I can no longer sign-in to GFWL and therefore can't use my save (with 100s hours of play) anymore.  Is there any way to find out what email is associated with a gamertag? My PC is still signed into my account, I just can't get any information from the GFWL menu while in game.  Edit: Would my save work if I created a new GFWL account and put it in the folder?  Edit#2: I'm assuming now as well that the problem with creating a new account will not be if the save game works but that my CD Key from steam is already activated on this particular GFWL account and so I wont be able to activate a new one.  My soul is becoming dark..  I remembered my e-mail in the end as I hadn't realised that you didn't just have to use live and hotmail accounts. I'd actually used my gmail!  Guessed the password and got it on my other PC!  Praise the sun!

When I go onto the storage tab on settings, it tells me that I have 5.67Gb possible storage and 488Mb available storage. This would mean that I have used 5.18Gb in apps/cache/downloads, when I have not. I have only used approximately 547Mb. This means that I can have a lot less and cached items. Can someone tell me what to do?

11b9n2	-55387	1349969355	javahelp	[Question] Should i instantiate construction-time class member variables in the constructor, or is it acceptable practice to do so in the declaration?	When writing a java class, I see two ways to instantiate a member variable at construction time. You can either instantiate it during the declaration:class Base {    private OtherClass oc = new OtherClass();};or you can set it up in the constructor:class Base {   private OtherClass oc;   public Base() { oc = new OtherClass(); } }I know both of these compile and seem to run fine. My question is whether or not there is any major reason to choose one over the other. Thanks for your time!

2hpvwx	-55387	1411930995	angularjs	Thought I'd share an AngularJS problem I encountered and how I solved it	Over the weekend I decided to play with [ui.bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/), and I decided to replicate their Alerts. So I copied over the code into my demo, refactoring it into jade and renaming the controller as 'AlertDemoCtrl' just didn't fit what I wanted. Seemed a trivial couple of changes. These were things I was confidant I did correctly.But for some reason, the dismiss buttons weren't showing up. Immediately I went back to the bare bones. Started a codepen with just the css, js, and my controller. It *still* wouldn't show me the close buttons. So i went further and replaced everything with the exact code from the ui.bootstrap alert demo. Suddenly it was working. Inexplicably. The only differences I was looking at was straight HTML instead of jade, and the name of the controller. I knew it wasn't the template language. But the controller name? Really? So I changed it a couple times. Worked, worked, worked, changed it back to what I was using.. 'AlertController'. The dismiss buttons vanished again. By stroke of luck I just happened to choose a name that was already in use, and instead of an error I just got odd behavior.**tl;dr** I'm an idiot who didn't read the source. Watch your names when using third-party AngularJS modules.

kkjdc	-55388	1316445522	writing	'Show, don't tell' help?	So, as I'm sure all of you are, I am an aspiring writer. I have a lot of room to make in my work but the phrase 'show don't tell' always haunts me the most. When my work gets critiqued it's the biggest point that comes up. But it confuses me entirely. To what degree do you show and don't tell, and to what degree do you tell? I have always thought that you 'tell' a story and don't 'show' it, in the literal sense. I find this phrase the most troubling when writing in 3rd person with an omniscient narrator. I guess, what I am trying to get to is, does showing always work? Is it bad writing if you tell more than you show? Does telling necessarily make a story 'boring'?

l46ft	-55388	1318000029	writing	When is enough, enough?	I've read many 'Tips for writers' lists and blogs and though they are very helpful they always say 'rewrite/ edit' and 'leave it for a week and read it again'. This makes perfect sense, and I have taken to doing this but how do you know when to stop? Whenever I leave a story for a while, and read it again I always see something I could change or something along those lines. I could continously change and edit a story over and over but that won't make it any better. How do you know when to save your own writing from yourself?

Seeing as my protagonist is a 25 year old male from the Seattle suburbs, I was wondering if you could tell me any slang that he would use regularly and how he would refer to his parents?

It seems odd to me that someone who hadn't been using Kamui their entire lives was able to utilize it in a situation where Obito could not. Was it ever explained how this happened, or was it just glossed over?

So could they take on the MEU? The Flood arrives with High Charity near the shattered remnants of the Collector base just outside the Omega Relay. The Gravemind is already established and in place aboard High Charity.First, the races of Mass Effect take them on in the same way they faced the Reapers initially. It takes 3 months for the races to band together against the Flood threat. Second, the Reapers take notice, and attempt to assault the Flood while also waging war on the alliance of races.Can the Flood come out on top?

Batman is quickly overpowered and infested, thus the Gravemind gains all of Batsie's knowledge.The JL/universe do not find out about the Flood until the Gravemind makes its first move, thus, the Gravemind gets all the prep-time it wants, armed with batman's knowledge on the League. Can the Gravemind now defeat the Justice League and take over Earth?For the sake of this prompt, the Flood IS capable of infesting the various people of the League if they can be weakened. For example, the Flood incorporating Kryptonite into their Infection Forms to be able to infest Superman. Biology and anatomy do not matter for this prompt. Bonus: The same scenario, but instead of just the JL, it becomes Flood vs DC universe. Same rule from above applies to all superheroes/villains. (Yeah I like doing Flood matchups so what wanna fight about it)
3b6u1s	-55416	1435324250	Naruto	(709 Spoiler) Why the hell did Naruto need so many clones?	Honestly, Dat Clone solo'd a few Kages and stopped Madara in his tracks. With like less than 10 clones Naruto totally shifted the tides of the war.So why the fuck does he need so god damn many to fight KIDS? Our Lord and Savior Madara mentioned not going full out on children, obviously, but if that was what Naruto is doing, why not summon like, 3 or 4 clones max? They should wipe the floor with the Shins not problem.Idk. I'm just angry and miffed that the Naruto is pulling an Ash Ketchum and reverting to moron-mode rather than Six Paths mode.

There is no way to kill him or remove him from existence as long as he acknowledges that he...**is**, on a metaphysical level.

The Preta path is capable of absorbing Chakra in any shape or nature, that much we know, but can the Preta Path block the other effects a technique might have?For example, if a Bijuudama were to explode next to a Rinnegan user, would they be able to use the Preta Path to absorb the explosion? Would the Preta Path be able to block Kirin, since the Kirin itself was actual lightning and was only GUIDED by Chakra? Could a user of the Preta Path survive being caught in the explosion of the Rasenshuriken if they did not absorb the technique directly?

The Corpus and Grineer, knowing they are in danger, ask the Tenno for aid. The Lotus obliges, and all active Tenno (Let's go with 200,000 given the Warframe player count) join the Corpus and Grineer in the defense of the System. Both sides have three months of prep time, during which raids ARE allowed by both elite ME teams and the Tenno on the enemy, in order to try and cripple the opposition before the war begins. For the sake of the prompt, Biotics and Warframe Powers operate in the same way. That means if something would usually negate a Tenno power, it would also negate a Biotic power, and vice versa. All of the major players are allowed. That means Shepard's crew comes in from the ME side, and Stalker, Zanuka, the Grustag Three, etc come in from the Warframe side, along with any I might have missed on either side. A full scale invasion of the Origin System will happen after the three months of prep. Will the MEU annex the Origin System, or will the Warframe universe repel the invaders?

3fwgqa	-55416	1438797272	Naruto	Browsing /r/WhoWouldWin, and this keeps bothering me...	I keep seeing people say that "Genjutsu doesn't work on things without chakra, because it works by altering chakra flow in the brain."Yet, on two occasions, we see that this is patently false. One we actually witness with Infinite Tsukiyomi, where regular animals that don't use chakra are affected. However, you could supposedly brush that off as Hagaromo not saying chakra was also split among animals. However, Kaguya used Infinite Tsukiyomi on the world BEFORE chakra was spread to humans, and it still worked, and turned people into White Zetsu. So where did this whole myth about Genjutsu not working on people without chakra come from?

3h28jn	-55416	1439610975	whowouldwin	A Flood outbreak occurs... On the Death Star.	After discovering a particularly strange, unknown particulate in the outer rim, the Empire decides to contain the new substance on the Death Star, one of its most secure facilities, in order to test the dust-like organisms for possible use as a biological weapon. Unaware that the Flood can activate when it deems necessary, the Empire unfortunately allows spores to seep into practically every crevice of the new station. Then, the Flood activates, and quickly overpowers the staff of the Deathstar, not only gaining a formidable battle station, but also gathering enough biomass from the docked carriers and Death Star staff to form a Gravemind, which roots itself in the heart of the Death Star. The Gravemind is, of course, intelligent enough to cover the no-longer-needed shaft of the Death Star with enough biomass to prevent a pesky stray missile from obliterating the entire station.

du8qb	-55422	1287641551	AskReddit	Why does urine output vary, even though glomerular filtration rate remains constant?	We know that drinking a lot of fluids results in increased urine output, and that not drinking enough results in decreased output.Since the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) should remain relatively constant, why is the above true if the same amount of fluid is always filtered?I understand the roles of ADH and aldosterone in increasing the kidneys' permeability to water, resulting in fluid retention. Does this have something to do with it? Thanks!**Edit: It's beyond the scope of the course I'm taking, but I talked to my professor and he explained it to me:**Ions or water are either absorbed or pumped out of the renal tubule, depending on the region (proximal/distal convoluted tubule, descending/ascending loop of Henle) that they are in (see [figure](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Renal_Diuretics.gif)).When we're dehydrated, ADH and aldosterone are released as a result of low BP and cause water to leave the distal convoluted tubule and the collecting duct. Our kidneys retain water. When you've consumed too much fluid, high BP inhibits the release of ADH and aldosterone, so water stays within the tubule and is eventually flushed out of your body.All of this takes place after glomerular filtration, which is why we have varying amounts of urine output, regardless of GFR.**TL;DR***GFR doesn't directly affect water absorption or retention by the nephron tubule.*If you're dehydrated, your kidneys reabsorb water.*If you've had too much, your kidneys get rid of it.

They'll work at Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Piperlime, Athleta, as well as their outlet and factory stores. You can load between $25 and $500 onto the card, and while you're limited to a single gift card per transaction, there's no limit to the number of cards you can buy between now and April 4th. I don't know whether or not Vons is running the promo, but it's worth a look.The catch: you'll need to create an online account and either add the coupon on their desktop site, or download the Safeway app and add the coupon there. It should be in the "just for U" section.I shop at Gap and BR a few times a year, and while I don't need anything at the moment, it'll come in handy later. Foresight can often help with frugality!Tl;dr: Yes, it stacks.

Thanks everyone.EDIT: Honestly, if it does not come with the Maverick fork then that's not a problem. It's a pain in the ass anyways. If you have a good frame, let me know.

Currently building up a new 2008 Trek 69er single speed frame (http://i.imgur.com/BDode.jpg) for next year's XC season.I am really up in the air on the fork choice. I would like to go fully rigid on this build and have narrowed it down to the White Brothers Rock Solid Rigid (465mm), DT Swiss XRR (470mm) or the well known Niner fork.I am hoping to get some advice from fellow redditors that have personal experience in the realm of riding with a rigid carbon fork. Did you have confidence in the structural integrity of the fork? Performance difference? If it comes down to it then I will slap on a Rockshox SID XX, but that really isn't what I want to do with this setup.Anything is appreciated!EDIT: Anyone have experience with the 'On-One Monocoque Fork'?

Right now, I have a spare WTB Nano 2.1 on the rear and a Bontrager Jones XR 2.25 up front because I had them laying around the shop. I've been riding gears for the past few years, but made the switch to singlespeed after cracks appeared in my THIRD Superfly frame and I wanted to try something different. The 69er is set up as fully rigid with a Niner fork up front so I was thinking of some high volume tires. Have heard good things about Maxxis Ardents for rigid single speeds and was hoping to get some recommendations from you folks. Thanks.EDIT: Here is the build so far http://i.imgur.com/um8bbCq.jpgEDIT 2: Went with Maxxis Ardent 2.25 rear and 2.4 front.

And more times than not, you'll get matched up with some douchebags. Either the players holding back that only care about kills, or the asshole who takes the bomb and hides in a corner the entire round. To handle people like that last guy, I'll kill him. I know. It's a dick move. But I play for one reason. To blow up the god damn bomb site. Not to see who's team can kill the other faster. Not to camp it out so I don't die. I play to blow shit up. Which, correct me if I'm wrong, is the game types intention. In ghosts, you couldn't do anything about those players and I feel like they took full advantage of that. So, does anybody know if, under certain circumstances, you're able to kill a team mate?I'm an asshole. I know. Sometimes you have no choice.

It will have different types of packs as well for example: undersea, halloween, fire, wind, heroic, lightning, valentines day, thanksgiving, ice, new years, ancient times, futuristic, army, gods, ect. The cards your local walmart sells will depend on the season and there will be a code to put into xbox live for the cards you buy in store and they all come with random effect pulls (besides the orange buff).  So toylogic make it since you have millions of dollars and team up with a TCCG company to steal more money.  GG no Re bank

According to a previous thread my ego was so massive it shattered the very thing that made happy wars a thrilling game. For that I am taking a break once again and going to farm Ascendant Shards and other material in destiny for awhile so I can get to lvl 30 warlock. I also melee shotgun in crucible like a pro and wait til my flame armour melee gets charged so I can have a mini overshield. I know I am too pro.  Cya when happy wars puts out actual good buffs and stops clowning around.

2nd7xa	-55458	1416919609	HappyWars	I have an idea what everyone wants (besides pay per view)	New classes: I have been seeing the same old thing like archer, necromancer, a spell sword (a warrior who can use magic/enchant), ninja/assassin class (a person who hides). AAccording to Marie on the facebook page, Toylogic can't add another class to the 360 version since memory limitations. However, this doesn't mean that they wont add another class to the xbox one version of the game, but this means we may have to buy new gear/weapons for this class if they do introduce a new class altogether. I would rather they add just 3 new sub classes so we don't have to buy gear/weapons for a new class altogether.New play type:  Pay per view (Taylqr) has already sent this in motion with giving Marie the idea of a new game type. Since Pay per views word is the gospel (sarcasm) everyone followed his idea and voted for capture the flag. I for one don't like CTF, however I am willing to give it a go. Who knows?  I might actually like this game type. I think Toylogic knows we are bored with the current game modes and might add more game types in the future.***Warning don't read if you are pay per view**** I wanted last man standing and or 1v1 fights that were ranked.The lag of the land:   We all know who lags and who lags on purpose to gain an edge in quick-match. Lagging for the most part is looked down on in the happy wars community, however some of us can't fix our connection.  How is Toylogic going to fix this complex problem? I for one don't have an answer for this, I think pay pew view is more knowledgeable on this topic than I am. Though, Toylogic's idea of having the lagger stay still and people with good connection destroying them seem fine and all....but look at it this way.  You can never fully expect that you will have great connection day in and day out. Also, people have different connections to each other, hell I know someone in my own state who has horrible connection and someone over seas has perfect connection.  Long story short, the lag ban hammer seems to be random at best, I too have been effected by it and I have never been called a "lagger" in my life. Maybe Taylqr will tell us how to fix our pings so we all can have 1 ping internet connection.A note to my clan: I joke around about Marie joining alpha, she wont she is just here to give our ideas to Toylogic, so stop being thirsty idiots. Thanks. Anything else I missed?  Pay pew view where is my parfait?

2xqvi6	-55458	1425352424	HappyWars	To Madara X Bad Kid	No one cares how bad you lag, everyone decent will think you are trash and you will have no respect in any of these forums, so go ahead and be a loser and lag, sad you have to cheat to win. No lifes these days.  GG no cheats 
2xqyol	-55458	1425354071	HappyWars	I know what's happening	I let my ego get out of hand and now everyone has egos of their own, I'm sorry I'll post happy stuff for like a few days, also try to remember this is just a game, it's to have fun. GG no Cheats.  Also on a side note: All you block-heads on the forums blaming Marie for the game's current issues understand that she can only do so much as she is only one person and is the community organizer and not the CEO of happy wars or the lead Developer. She is still new to the happy wars scene, so don't hate on her if things are still slow.  Also, developers can't with a snap of their fingers automatically change the server/game play at will that takes time and money, but most of you guys wouldn't know because none of you guys have ever made a game yourselves.  So stop your tears, they will fix it in due time.

2y0iwy	-55458	1425557125	HappyWars	Where did you hear about happy wars?	Some scruby friend of mine was playing the demo and said it was the greatest game ever and thought the title was stupid, but he insisted that I try it out. Gg my wallet from that moment forward and there where super cashers the first months of happy wars release as in: paladin mail, storm armour lightning mages destroying my low lvl team in QM plus I thought meteor was a solo skill. That said I saw a cool dressed warrior with heroic helmet storm armour and golden eagle shield, and wanted to have that as my main.

2ywiq4	-55458	1426249201	HappyWars	I am done spending money in Happy Wars.	I no longer support this Child Casino called Happy Wars. I would rather get a real life set of armor then this intangible virtual set of armor that you have then a ten precent chance to get.  I should of stopped months ago, but I was addicted to Happy Wars, I will not be spending a red cent from this point forward. 30 dollars and only 2 super premiums? What a waste of my money, I could get full dlcs, skins, recolors, ect on other games for the same amount of money. Hell, if I didn't spend the thousand-ish dollars on this game (I was here since the second week of the release)  I probably be much happier than I am now and not feel ripped off. If you have spare cash to spend I recommend you not spend on this dying game.  I don't want a refund, I am not seeking sympathy, just a warning for future comers not to waste your cash on this game, there are alot better games to spend them on.  Gg wallet wars. Also I am not quitting happy wars, just not ever spending my cash on this game ever again.
2yxvbp	-55458	1426274153	HappyWars	Guy was talking trash, so I took the trash out.	
2z63hs	-55458	1426458550	HappyWars	So much drama this weekend.	I was no-lifing tomb raider and almost got all the achievements because I am an achievement whore, and when I came back to the reddit page. TAO drama all over the place. I guess I don't have to cause drama for there to be drama. 42/50 people I are so good.
2z863w	-55458	1426509838	HappyWars	Looks like Han Solo and True Drama made up.	They also taught gulu how to beat Taylqr in a 1v1. Gg he taught me.

Marie and Taylar have been posting less and almost left because of my evilness. I will restrain myself, I did not mean to upset you guys I'll go back to playing the witch and the hundred knight. Also if you want a bad mlg video made post it here and I'll make it (maybe if I feel like it of mediocre quality) gg no whey 
2ztl4n	-55458	1426958522	HappyWars	Im leaving TAO because True is a punk kid.	I am out of TAO and True is a punk ass bitch who is the worst leader ever. He has no skill what so ever and hides behind his teammates then has the balls to dance on me when I lose, when I killed him by myself, but has to have an army of people to kill me. Go to hell true hope TAO disbands because you are a worthless leader.

30dhj6	-55458	1427379575	HappyWars	I think Toylogic forgot to add something to this event.	Like stars, boxes, or free items.
30eazm	-55458	1427392916	HappyWars	The devs copied Final fantasy	look at the new warrior armour and type in onion knight, oddly similar...square enix lawsuit in coming!!
30fqyn	-55458	1427415476	HappyWars	Toylogic has missed the ship again	I vote Marie to be the lead developer and I will sail to Japan and fight final fantasy style and summon bahamut and destroy all these lazy plans the devs have for happy wars and make the ultimate wars. It will be titled:  Azure vs Taylqr's wallet.  All items are for show and you level up (your rank and items) by killing people and completing objectives. You get more powerful after completing an assigned mission which will be given out each match. The mission will be random to everyone so no one is bored or has the same mission twice.  Also Buffs and rare weapons/armor are gained from completing hard to kill bots and winning a certain amount of times in QM. But since I am uber evil all drops will be on an rng drop table and you have to buy tickets to up the percent that you will receive something of use. Also for the low low price of 100 dollars I may throw in a map every 2 months!  You say you want new armor and weapons and new classes? Then if you pay an additional 100 dollars, I'll have my skilled drawers make any armor set you want!  "but what about my buffs?" you cry out.   Hey I got it covered gulu x alfalfa,  for another 100 dollars I'll buff you up so much, only people who spent as much as you or found a glitch in our superb system can stand a chance to kill you!  Also, hate those laggers? with our freeze em and eat em program we actually go inside the game you are playing and scoop up the laggers with a giant demon mouth and spit them in a holding cell for the rest of the match. They will be terrorized by a sound track of wendellsmalls best hit collection!  Also you want season 3? what about season 3d!  That's correct 3d!! The characters you control will come to life and fight in front of you with life like sounds and amazing quality.  So download Azure vs Taylqrs wallet now!  It's the best game, also I don't speak any other languages so I will have to hire a community translator in three years! So don't hate because I don't understand what you are saying!  ~vent out~

31ok4n	-55458	1428360137	HappyWars	The history of happy wars from beta til now	I joined happy wars, then cashers made me leave QM since, then I co-oped for awhile using my battle katana (best weapon ever) watched some gods 1v1, threw my wallet at my tv screen got some lousy gear trained comma hawk invited me to his bird is the word clan, HH got whooped left joined God or was it Titan no idea then Alphas, then drama happened and anti warrior aids can't be found til I spent tons of cash and I didn't know about the reset glitch. I met pay per view the cheater of the land and lost then hot wired my net to Mc Donalds and never lost a 1v1 ever again. TAO is garbo, PTC rush clan, and Noble has no bells.  Marie X Alpha parents the reddit forums and Pay per view made it.  More custom videos and tu tu revolution stole all my subs.  Shrek doesn't make vids anymore because wendellsmalls beat him in a 1v1, and comma jock wind swapped his xbox into a dumpster. GG no re, also weak daddy is still a nub cake and everyone else besides mystic hen and venom lommy is weak, and dark is an apple pie.

36qnxy	-55458	1432204369	HappyWars	Someone record the new sets please	Toylogic doesn't know how to create links or update their own site, so anyone who is up this early please record and post the new LE to reddit.  
36rewg	-55458	1432220433	HappyWars	Toylogic should	Put all the buffs on a dart board and throw darts at them to see what buffs they will nerf and make a new buff to replace that nerfed buff. 
36rwdf	-55458	1432228040	HappyWars	Best cookie cutter set up now. (Armor)	Anti warrior aid, intensify defense, Mobility 3, ambush reliver 3. Throw in fg and gsmu on your shield parameter 6, shield charge hp recovery 5 reduce status, your weight relivers and that equals best defense.
36v664	-55458	1432293877	HappyWars	Toylogic can't make up their minds	First it was nerfs, but less than a day later they take it all back. Did too many people complain about warzerkers having over 4k attack get your attention? 
376vth	-55458	1432551173	HappyWars	So what's this about golden box keys now?	I been playing neverwinter for a week now (got a lvl 60 trickster rogue, no thanks to Retro and Mystic who were supposed to be my guide ((bunch of nubs)) and saw you have to pay money to open the Golden Chest?Good job Toylogic, I think I made the right choice in playing another game for awhile instead of playing this laggy, broken, cheating game. If you exploit you win plain and simple, that's why you see so many kids running warzerkers thinking they are good, or see a bunch of laggers group up together or have lvl 40-50's on your team while the other team is a stacked pay to win team.Smart move Toylogic, I mean after three years no one could fix the servers right? I mean after all you are a small Japan company and your is "free to play" and a few million dollars isn't enough to get better server.  I mean seriously what does it cost to get better servers? Maybe you should have a cash pool meter on our screens and say, "Please help us reach better servers." Because I know for a fact you guys over at Toylogic are greedy, lazy, and just don't care about your game unless it's about "Buy our new stuff and nerf that so they buy more stuff." Tens of thousands of potential customers will leave you Toylogic because you are unloyal to your customers, unwilling to listen to what needs to be fixed, and flat out liars.  We know you buff/unbuff certain things in the game, we test them out and post videos about them, then you go silent knowing you want us to buy the newest buff. Or in the case of lag, make an anti lag system then take it away because too many laggers were upset (bet they were pay to win customers).TL:DR ~ Toylogic only cares about your wallet, the lag will never be solved, and I'm playing Neverwinter it has lag too but I don't have to spend 1000-200 dollars to have good gear.   get good TL
37bbl6	-55458	1432637754	HappyWars	Pledge not to spend until Toylogic fixes their shit.	Besides the glitches, besides all of the money grabbing/lies about nerfing buffs, Toylogic continues to sneak by with their horrible servers. Compensation wont help you this time, I'm done you have lost me and my wallet forever, as a single player you probably don't care and that's why I will take my money elsewhere to games where I spend 20-30 dollars I feel like I got "actual content" you know how many cod maps and extra I could get with the few hundred I could of spent on you guys, how many extras I can get in almost any other game for less than hundred dollars is amazing. Thank you TL for opening my eyes and seeing how a big of a waste spending money on your game really is. 
382du6	-55458	1433155202	HappyWars	Looks like history repeats itself once again.	Toylogic makes a major mistake and send Marie to settle down the community. I really do find it sad how Toylogic likes to throw her to the wolves and the people her ask her to fix things even though she can't.  I'm not saying the information Marie gives us is useless, but seeing how she is a newcomer compared to most of us veterans and Toylogic likes to keep secrets even from her, asking her to tell the developers to fix X, Y, or Z seems to be useless.  Look how long the developers are taking to fix a simple Warzerker glitch and it took about to months to fix the horse glitch.  However, if it's making them lose money I.E. restart glitch, they will be all over it like no ones business.  There are probably countless other glitches as well, not to mention how the lag catcher (Toylogic's use of the anti lag system) is random on who it slows down. Hey Toylogic just use the anti-lag on all people from South America and Europe and you're good, and maybe some basement dwelling America trying to lag his way up the leader-boards. Also Toylogic gratz on making 1v1 private matches not joinable anymore once it started. Now we can't get rid of the bots like we used to by having people join.  Once again another good thing ruined for no good reason and Toylogic will deny ever changing it as well.  Instead of this update of nerfing/inhancing buffs, maybe Toylogic should fix the mistakes it made in the season 3 update.

3d46e7	-55458	1436786702	Neverwinter	What should I spend 25 dollars worth of zen on?	I been hearing from sources that spending money on armour is silly and I do have 2 pieces of two tier two set armour for trickster rogue (master assassin's and sinister shade) along with the epic shore set ring and necklace set, and the tier 2.5 dagger set from castle never. I been doing my campaigns as well and have 3 boons done and 96 percent on the main campaign almost reaching the artefact weapon which I could really use.  All I really need are rank 8 or higher gems, soul forges, armour ehancements, get better slot artefacts, and level them up. However, that being, I still have a 50 movement speed horse and look like a noob compared to other players with lower gear score than me who are riding rare and epic mounts. Should I buy a mount or should I just invest in Astral diamonds and get better gear? BTW my gear score is 14k.
3d7ahd	-55458	1436839329	Neverwinter	Will the artifact set be better than castle never set?	I am nearing my first artifact weapon (just one more day til 100 percent completion and just need to get the book, gem, and tooth) and I'll get it. Last weekend I was lucky to get good drop from tier 2 dungeons to get the castlenever dagger set and the shore set which I am happy I got because my gs is just barley over 14k.  I may want to do some respecing of my TR so my GS will be boosted more since I love using life steal when clerics are no where to be seen, it helped me in a tight spot more than once.  However, with Tiamat approaching I might farm her and get enough favors to buy my own off-hand dagger or get it as a rare drop from Tiamat.  That being said, I still need better artifacts for my three artifact slots, better armor enhancements, vorpal and soul forge gems, an augmented pet, and an epic mount (yes I know I'm a filthy casual), and hopefully I can get lucky and get a spare off-hand golden stiletto and sell it for a high price. Fingers crossed.
3d8ng2	-55458	1436870921	Neverwinter	What's the cheapest mount on the zen market?	I already know about the coupon trick you get from getting a character to level 20, but I want an epic mount and wont get on til this weekend so can anyone tell me the cheapest epic mount I can get?
3dfp38	-55458	1436998938	Neverwinter	In a bit of a dilemma	I have been saving up 40 dollars to spend on NeverWinter, however I really don't know where to go.  I mostly play on the weekends (Friday-Sunday) and want to spend the money I saved up wisely. From reading various sources and posts here, I could buy an epic mount, an augmented companion, and or the dragon race.  However, after I log on I will have completed the campaign 100 percent and will be able to get my artifact weapon. However, I need the claw, gem, and bar to get my artifact.  I was thinking I could either farm all friday on T2 dungeons to get my enough AD or gold to get these materials or just get a rare mount and use the rest for AD. There is also the fact that I am eager to play the new Tiamat dungeon opening up this Friday which might net me an off-hand artifact dagger.  There is also the fact that I need better Artifact accessories, needing vorpal and soulforge gems as well. I also want to re-roll my class because I believe I made a grave error in setting up my TR.  I really have no idea how my TR has 14k gs with all the noob errors I made, but I been reading up this week and will put my knowledge in fixing my character.  I also heard there are soft caps for crit and my crit is 3k ish which I heard was sort of high and I need to boost up my Armor Penetration upward to about 24% which I doubt I am no where near.  There are also some skills I want to try out as well in a boss room which I didn't know the usefulness of.  So in the end, I will either have a 15k gs TR at the end of Sunday or just fail hard.

However it does get sort of dull sometimes awaiting for your weapons to be finished being made and if no one's online doing solo runs. I am quite the new Comer when it comes to this game and have no idea what do next without help, so I joined my friends clan. From what I read and advice from my friends, everything that's "powerful or good" can be earned though missions and credits. Meaning I don't have to spend platinum to get powerful in this game, which appeals to me. However, silly colors like black, the capes on the back of players, and appearences are locked behind a paywall?  Im down spending money for this gane, but is there something worthwhile I can spend my platinum on and is there a way where I can team up with people my level so I don't have to solo missions when I have no one online to play with?

Anyone have experience for how much money you get?

1bkjzp	-55471	1364966270	Philippines	I feel you about Nancy Binay. Do we need to change our election system?	Our election system is based on **popular vote**, meaning the most popular candidate can take home the bacon. The problem is the politicians pander with the masses to makes sure they can make the vote. They will compose catchy jingles, dance on stage and create a fiesta. I will not go about vote buying. It's too obvious.We all felt the effects of popularity voting. Political dynasties are made because of it. People will always vote for the name with most recall.*SIGH*, the Commies were right. Democracy is a sham.

1f48is	-55471	1369624877	Coffee	[Question] Do you really have to soap up your coffee tools/equipment?	I did a quick reddit search before posting this. Seems like it is fine to soap up ***some*** of your equipment. For example, french press and regular auto-drips can be cleaned with soap but Moka is a no-no. Some use soap in their aeropress but most of the time they just rinse it and soap it once a week.Since owning an auto-drip, I just rinsed the tools with water and I use vinegar once a month to clean the water tanks and the inside. A dash of baking soda on the beaker and permanent filter can help eradicate the oils and residue.I am now into toddy-style (very rudimentary; nothing fancy) and a pour-over. I always rinse my cone with water after using it for two months.In reality I am just a lazy guy so I don't touch the sponge. Does soap really matter in my cone? What's your take? Thanks!

I'm currently in the police academy in a county where the local Sheriff's Office does call backs for traffic stops while everyone else does approaches. Our academy is taught largely by SO instructors, so during the traffic stops chapter all we do is call backs. I am going to work for an agency that does primarily approaches. I asked two different instructors on two different occasions if I could attempt an approach during a practical. Both instructors agree, and I did a passenger-side approach, however the instructors told the driver to shoot me through the window as soon as I walked up to prove a point that approaches aren't safe. So I'm stuck in a situation where the instructors look down on approaches so much that they won't even teach them. Can you give me pros and cons on each technique? What does your agency do? What can I do differently to avoid getting injured? Thanks in advance.

I carry one on duty, I have one as my backup gun, it's just what I've been trained on and what I'm comfortable with. I'm looking to buy something different, but I have no idea where to start. I either want a small hammerless revolver, or another  full-size handgun. I've been looking at the VP9 or the P320. Can anyone give me some recommendations?

(I shamelessly stole this idea from the one we made on /r/Cars for driving songs). I think it would be interesting to see what we all listen to and I 100% expect this playlist to be filled with Taylor Swift.Here's the link so everyone can add to it! http://open.spotify.com/user/ragin64/playlist/2QvTZW5HfaGvCq7LlUxIEG The only rule is that no is allowed to delete songs from the playlist. Also please check the list before adding songs to avoid duplicates. If you don't have Spotify, feel free to comment with the songs you want added. I hope this works out. Thanks in advance.

s2lfi	-55475	1334069800	FinalFantasy	Final Fantasy Type-0 opinions..	Hey guys, just wondering what you thought of Type-0. In terms of gameplay, it feels like a cross between Kingdom Hearts and The 3rd Birthday. It's fun to play, and it's pretty deep IMO (I understand Japanese enough to read most of the menu terms and abilities).As for the story, I searched for subbed trailers on youtube and found [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4D9Wq_8TLc). That's the opening movie when you start a new game. And [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TeYIPGvuzw) is a trailer.(Do note that these are fansubs). It has a pretty great setting IMO. I think that the only downside this is gonna have is the characters. I mean one even looks a LOT like Lightning. Maybe they'll all be cardboard. (since there are 14 main characters, in other words, class 0 as a whole.) I guess we'll just have to wait for the English release to find out. (BTW, I LOVE the fact that there's blood!)So Reddit, what do you think?(P.S: This is my first post.)Edit: Grammar mistakes.

sg228	-55475	1334760353	japan	I need help in meeting new people in class.,	My family and I moved to Japan last year and went to school as a normal Japanese student would. I made a friend and we got along pretty well until the school year ended. In our school, students switch classes every new school year. (I'm in Class B and he's Class C). So one day, we met in the hallway, he said that I should try and talk to one of his other friends, who happens to be my classmate. Problem is, I'm really shy when meeting new people, and I'm not that good at Japanese. And it doesn't help that he's a quiet person, either.So Reddit,  what can I do to  introduce myself to him and (possibly) get to know each other?  Any form of advice would be appreciated.I chose r/japan because most of the people here has experience with japanese people (I think).

sgqsp	-55475	1334786571	FinalFantasy	FFType-0 TIP!!!!!	For those of you who play Type-0, read this:So my brother was playing Type-0 and he discovered a neat trick that'll let you summon an eidolon without anyone in your party dying. You will need Rem. If you keep playing her she'll learn an ability written as 死なないで、which means "don't die".(I don't know when she'll learn it, she just did one day while I was playing.)  It casts Reraise on your party for an amount of time.  Now, while Reraise is still in effect, use your eidolon, and you'll notice that after the timer reaches zero, the character you sacrificed will be revived with full HP! P.S: Ace also has a move that will cast reraise, but it's chances of happening are really slim. You have to draw 4 blue cards (i think), using any of his deck drawing abilities. (ライフデッキ has better chances than most of his other abilities tho'.)

So I was reading the Prisoner of Azkaban when I noticed something during the time Hermione and Harry use the Time-Turner. It was 5 minutes to midnight when Hermione used the Time-Turner. So, after that it was probably around 9 o'clock since she turned the Time-Turner 3 times. The thing is, there was "a stream of golden sunlight was falling across the paved floor from the open front doors.".Why would there be sunlight at 9 in the evening? I think it was the same for the movie as well.  So, could it be a possible book mistake? Or could there be another explanation?
143gfw	-55475	1354347226	LucidDreaming	The story of my first ever (short) lucid dream. And a few questions.	I finally did it! After 2 weeks of lurking, 2 weeks of fruitless attempts I finally did it! Here's what happened:I went to sleep yesterday at around midnight, and woke up today at 6am (I live in Japan) because my balls were itching. I noticed the time , and after I have satisfied my balls, I read stuff about LD on my phone for about half an hour and fell asleep.I ended up in what looked like a high school, only with zombies. I managed to escape the school with a teacher on her car. From this point on, I couldn't remember anything. The next thing I remember, was that I was eating meatballs with my brother at our house.  I noticed him spreading meatballs into a game controller. I said "Dude, what the fuck are you doing?!" I noticed I was dreaming, so I screamed at him: "THIS IS A DREAM!!". He smiled, nodded and disappeared. I was left alone at my house. So then I looked at my left hand and it was shaped like a foot with big toes sticking out of it. hell yeah! I'm finally lucid! so i start summoning people, I tried to summon an old friend from high school. I thought about him real hard and when I looked at the couch, he was there. My mind was blown! I tried a bunch of other stuff, but they wouldn't work. Then my friend disappeared, so I tried summoning him, but he wouldn't appear. Or at least I thought so. The door bell rang. It was a delivery man , he said he had a package for me: my friend. I saw a long rectangular box behind him, and then I woke up from my alarm.What should I do to be able to control the dream? It felt like I just knew I was dreaming but I can't do anything to change the dream itself.And is there any chance that that was just a dream about me lucid dreaming?Thanks everyone!

15gv6l	-55475	1356531762	LucidDreaming	I attempted WILD in a non-lucid dream.	I stayed up until 5am. Woke up on 11. I thought I should WILD, so I did. Failure. I fell asleep a few minutes after I closed my eyes, but the dream I had afterwards was totally unique to me. It went like this:I was watching videos of typhoons, and tsunamis on youtube. Suddenly my mother was next to me, asking me why am I always watching videos like that. I shrug, she suddenly looked mad. She said "If you don't help me cook for your brothers birthday, you're grounded for a week motha'fucka." Dream-me said "Fine."So I helped her cook. After that, I slouched off to my floor mattress, and I lay down, thinking of morning talkshows to watch when I wake up. I closed my eyes, and then suddenly, I heard a loud ringing. "SP!" I thought, then suddenly I couldn't move. I tried flailing around. I couldn't move. Then a few seconds later, I could move again.I was stil in the room, but I tried to count my fingers. I had six. I pinched my nose and inhaled. I could breathe normally. I said, "I'm dreaming!". What's weird is that I kept thinking that I had a WILD, even though I was already dreaming even before the "sleep paralysis" happened.In this now lucid dream, my brother was sleeping on the bed next to my mattress. I wanted him to dissappear, so I could summon someone to make out with. I turned away from him, thinking hard that he'll be gone. I turned back to him. he's still there. After numerous attempts, he's still there. I had one last idea left. I shook him up, shouting "Wake up! Wake up!" Mom's put up a party for your birth day!". He said "Where?". "Through the black portal, of course." I said, pointing to the window. He slides the window open, and there is a black, swirling hole right outside the window. He steps outside, and I slam the window close. I woke up after that.It was mindfucked. Does that count as a lucid dream? What could I do to make people appear/disappear? Why did the portal appear when I couldn't make my brother disappear? I'm sorry if I asked too many questions. I'm just so psyched that I had another LD, even though it's only my second one.

You can fill in the blank.How very easy it is for us. If we have forgotten an item we just jump in our car or call our spouse and continue on without much thought.How very different in Haiti or Argentina or any other 3rd world country. In fact "without a Christmas" basket they will probably not even get an extra serving of rice. This woman in the picture is from last year's delivery. In that “basket” are a few extra staples that just might afford the opportunity for a special Christmas meal; not steak or ham but rather a little larger serving of rice and beans and maybe some chicken bouillon flavoring.The tub is an extra gift to be used for carrying laundry, wash basin, maybe even a bath tub.

You can only move in two dimensions and the movement of the spaceship reminded me of that of a hovercraft. The whole game is played in bird's-eye view. I remember one particular level where you are in some kind of jungle, with trees and stuff like that.The levels seemed pretty bright to me.The ship's weapon is a laser. I played it on Windows 95.I hope this is enough information for someone to recognize the game I'm looking for. Thanks in advance!EDIT: It's not one of those games where the map keeps moving downwards and you have to destroy or dodge enemies which are flying towards you.

That way csgl wouldn't be down every time a game ended.The skins don't change after the bet has been closed and the calculation could run at low priority (if it's too slow maybe only use it for bo3 matches, or calculate the team with higher % first because that's more likely to happen)

I know he is not the most likable character in the first place, but his stalwart neutrality and dedication to what is right is what makes him a great character in the books. In the show he is just a cunt. He shows next to no contrition for meaning to sacrifice Gendry; whereas in the books it was the last thing he wanted to do. He treats Davos like shit, rather than respecting him for being the only *true* and honest Lord he has.I think the show has done many things right, and some even better than the books, but amongst the things it has gotten wrong, this is one that irritates me.

Plus as far as I am aware nothing has changed compared to the first 24 hours, so why should the battery drain be so drastically different?
1kv7sm	-55493	1377168840	Cricket	The best cricket side in history. [Discussion]	In this post I will outline **my opinion** of the best side possibly composed; from all eras and nations to have played the game. If you disagree, please state your reasoning, don't get aggro or troll.I have noticed that the majority of my side comes from the modern era; this is not observation bias - I am well schooled in cricket history. Also, you will note a large amount of Australians in the side. Again, this is not bias, as I am a Kiwi.Each player in this side is chosen based on the peak form of their career.So the side:&gt; 1) Matthew Hayden (Aus) - 50.73Obvious selection in my opinion. His ability to dominate an attack and batter sides into submission is extremely valuable. At the peak of his career he was averaging mid 50's and showed a remarkable penchant for scoring big centuries consistently.&gt; 2) Herb Sutcliffe (Eng) - 60.73Before my time, but his statistics speak for themselves. He was a very old school player who scored his runs slowly, but surely. This makes him the perfect foil for Hayden at the other end.&gt; 3) Don Bradman (Aus) - 99.94Enough said.&gt; 4) Ricky Ponting (Aus) - 51.85Scored over 10,000 test runs with an average peaking over 60 before the form slump that ended his career. Ponting at his prime is the best batsman since Bradman IMHO. He has scored the second most runs and the second most centuries in test cricket history. Obvious choice for me.&gt; 5) Sachin Tendulkar (Ind) - 53.86His statistics speak for themselves. Most runs in history, most centuries in history. One of the most remarkable players in history.&gt; 6) Jacques Kallis (SA) - 56.10Batting all-rounder extraordinaire. His competition for this spot is Garfield Sobers, another astounding player. Kallis was chosen for his ability to grind, rather than explode. With the other explosive players in this side, a calming figure in the lower middle order is important. His strong bowling is another important feature for this side.&gt; 7) Adam Gilchrist (Aus) - 47.60Averaged near 60 for much of his career before a terrible slump towards the end. Displayed the ability to steal matches away from sides from the beginning to the end of his career. Perhaps not the greatest wicket keeper of all time (though not far off), nobody can take this position off him. &gt; 8) Shane Warne **Captain** (Aus) - 25.41 (bowling average)His record speaks for itself. Despite averaging a few runs higher than Murali, many (most?) consider him to be the best spinner to have ever played the game (myself included). He was a very capable batsman and his knowledge of the game was unparalleled. He is my pick as captain of this phenomenal side.&gt; 9) Malcolm Marshall (WI) - 20.94Incredible figures. Very imposing bowler and exactly the type of dynamic presence required in a bowling attack. This spot in the attack is very hard fought, with as many as 10 others in contention, but Marshall wins out as my dynamic quick.&gt; 10) Muttiah Muralitharan (SL) - 22.72His record speaks for itself. He took the most wickets in history at an incredible average. The only reason he is second choice spinner is because he was known to be easily rattled and found himself struggling on fast pitches; taking the lions share of his wickets on the subcontinent.&gt; 11) Glenn McGrath (Aus) - 21.57Just like Marshall, there are up to 10 others who could contend for this position, but the shear longevity of McGraths career, taking more wickets than any other quick while maintaining his phenomenal average are what win him this position.&gt; 12) Joel Garner (WI) - 20.97Another dynamic quick. Very valuable as 12th man. To substitute for Murali on pitches that don't suit 2 spinners.*****I think with the balance of this side, it is well worth picking these two great spinners for most pitches. They are both such incredible players that it wouldn't matter. The bowling of Kallis makes up for the 3rd quick spot.

Even with NEI I am still stuck with how to provide it power.I figure that a coal generator would be used to power it, but for a coal generator you need compressed steel, and for compressed steel you need a compressor, and for a compressor you need a wafer, and for a wafer you need a circuit fabricator, and for a circuit fabricator you need power..I would be very grateful for some help. The wiki's are next to useless.Thanks in advance. The learning curve on this game is far more severe than vanilla minecraft.

Unfortunately he didn't die in the process; I'm sure it would be a nice bounty. Don't think I have to worry about him any time soon though, he beggared himself down to 2K in the process, ha!In 4 attempts, his inventory totalled:* 22 Saws	-	$8,800* 24 Drugged meat -	$2,400* 15 Bricks	-	$2,250* 26 Water	-	$2,600* 2 Door stops -		$400* 9 clubs	-	$1,800* 11 Wire cutter -	$4,400* 8 Ladders	-	$14,400* 2 Explosive	-	$2,400$39,450For a complete failure, that is rather entertaining to me. He was barking up the wrong tree the whole time anyway, and even then he didn't get a look down the end of that path.

2cst69	-55493	1407343022	zelda	[Discussion] Thoughts about Wind Waker HD, having disliked the original	I belong to the seemingly rare group in this subreddit who never liked Wind Waker when it was originally released. My favourite Zelda games are OOT and TP.Having recently bought a Wii U, I decided to revisit WW and see how I felt about it after all this time, as a more mature gamer. I must say that I am impressed with it, the game is much more fun than I ever remembered. **However**, I still only rate it #5 out of my favourite Zelda titles. The other two to I rate higher are SS and ALTTP. (No, I never really liked MM either, hopefully they remake it one day and I can give it another shot.)Having recently played through both OOT (MQ) and TP, I feel that WW, even the remake, is somewhat more clunky to control. The dungeons at times have an irritating feeling where you have to do things exactly right, or else face the consequences/repeat monotonously. Just feels like there is less wiggle room, which hindered my enjoyment a little.I guess I am just curious as to what it is within the game which so many people love? This is not a bait post, so please do not downvote because I dislike(d) a popular game - I would genuinely like some thoughts about this.

The amount of times people just sit there like stunned fucking mullets while they are being healed, just watching their medic get shot and bombed is astounding. And this extends to every tier, people are simply atrocious at protecting medics.
2wkcmx	-55493	1424452471	Robocraft	I love the integration of Megabots into T10, but...	...dear lord are there some noobs with Megabots. I don't see how it is possible. In order to even acquire the bare minimum required to build a Megabot, it means a player has spent a significant amount of time in T10. You would think that they are good players, and can build good bots; but nope.I'll try and paint a picture of an experience I just had:I was playing medic, I shadowed the Megabot as well as about 6 other people to the front line. There are a few regular T10s at the very front, then the Megabot, then myself. The noob playing Mega didn't fire a single shot at the enemy, he instead tried to reverse and run away (and we were not losing or being driven back, mind you). As the medic, I was behind him, blocking his retreat. This is poor form in most situations, but this guy was actively not even shooting at the enemy and I stayed in place to spite him. He started spamming SMG on me, and raving away in chat. I walked around him eventually, once the front line actually needed me and began healing the people who were actually doing stuff. Shortly thereafter he comes hobbling over to me at about 70% trying to steal heals, all while **still** not shooting the enemy. I quickly let go of RMB and focus fired on the useful teammates, before he had another tanty and quit the game, saying "no more mega for you". As if his presence was any help whatsoever. We won. Easily. It still irritates me that he got a hero bonus for it.Anyway, that anecdotal rant aside: can you people **please** stop building Megabots with T0 white cubes (or any cube &lt;T8)? You are useless. You are worse than useless, because you are a negative impact on the team. This is not the rant of someone who is jealous of Megabots. I have 15 million RP in the bank; I just know that this is not enough to make a proper bot, and therefore am not doing it so that I don't fuck over everyone else.

36gtnh	-55493	1432021371	asoiaf	(SPOILERS AIRED) I genuinely don't know how to feel about this season	I think most of us are in agreeance that this season has really gone off the rails. The quality of the storyline divergences are increasingly poor, the inconsistencies are piling high and it is just all around deteriorating.The thing that confuses me is that by now, I just want the show to diverge as far as possible from the real story, to minimise spoilers when the real story is released. This will result in an even poorer TV "adaptation", but would allow for the books to present the content as it was intended.On the other hand, the show was fantastic for the first few seasons, before starting to decline last season, and slipping extensively this season. It is disappointing in it's own regard when it set such lofty standards to begin with.TL;DR - Sad the show is getting crap. Happy the show won't completely spoil the books.

2anzg7	-55496	1405345817	dayz	Civilian airstrips in Dayz SA?	I think it would be awesome if the devs added small gravel/dirt airstrips that would be civilian/business owned rather than military. These airstrips would be possibly found next to farms, small cargo businesses perhaps? These airstrips would balance the hot spots produced by military airstrips, obviously it would be a bit much adding another military airstrip, so maybe this is an alternative. These new airstrips would lower the popularity of major airstrips and provide high civilian clothing/weapon/equipment/machine parts (when they get added) spawns.New items could be added, such as new civilian weapons, farming/airfield equipment and clothing, these spawns would be at a high capacity balancing the loot jump from basic gear to full military gear, providing a better gradual evolution of the player.Eventually when vehicles etc. are added, these airfields will provide a high loot spawn for machine parts instead of finding a main rotter assembly in a shed in the middle of Berezino...So what do you guys think?

Bodies slide all over the ground like its ice and bodies slump to the group like they turned to jelly. I know it's hard to tweak effects like this but maybe down the line it would be good if the ragdoll physics were a little more 'stiff'. Bodies wouldn't immediately slump to the ground, they would rather collapse, there needs to be more friction. Anyway still loving the updates, especially this one!

I have found over various character restarts, that they occur after a sever restart; once you log back in your character is wiped. I have found a possible solution, ( i have been reset 5 times) is that when you log in DON'T MOVE. Don’t do anything when you log in, if your character got wiped then log out, bring up the task manager and close DayZ. This has worked every time for me. So pretty much log out before restarts if you can and close DayZ without moving if your character did get wiped.

This has probably been asked a thousand times, so don't up vote, I’m just looking for somebody to answer a couple of my questions.  This is my first time going to RTX as it's pretty expensive to travel from Australia, and i really wanted to score a 3 day pass.Also, for previous RTX goers, what should i expect at RTX? Is it really hard to get into the panels? Are there massive lines? Will i be able to see a lot of stuff or not much? Will I have a good chance at meeting everybody? How much should i be looking at spending there? Etc.Thanks a bunch for your help.

WIC stands for World In Conflict.So my brand new laptop with a NVidia GeForce 820M graphics card can't run World In Conflict, but it can run Civ 5, etc. pretty much any game at reasonable settings that came out in 2014, WiC came out in 2007.....It has an error message that pops up whenever I start the game saying "Error, no appropriate 3D graphics card detected, unable to run World in Conflict.When i go to device manager I have two 'Display adapters', one is the Intel(R) HD Graphics Family (I’m assuming this is the on-board motherboard graphics card) and the other one is the Nvidia GeForce 820M.Both are enabled, i thought this might be the problem so i disabled the intel card, my computer was then able to run WiC without the error message except it was extremely laggy, as with any other game i tried to run, so i re-enabled it.So, Why in the fuck can i never have a bug god damn free experience? There is always something wrong. As a side note, i cannot play WiC on my main computer either (Nvidia 660Ti ) because there is a problem with a dll file which is apparently corrupted which i can't replace (I tried).Also, on my desktop computer, there are also two 'Display Adapters', both are enabled and i can play pretty much every game at ultra-settings.

I was fortunate to go and get a [con-exclusive, signed by Barbara and Arryn bumblebee shirt](http://imgur.com/qRqp1gq), unfortunately.... I realised after that I had gotten it, that I had the wrong size, so I went and bought another one in the right size etc. You can check out Hanabee's mention and a more clear version of the shirt [here](http://roosterteeth.com/members/journal/entry.php?id=3329271)But now I'm left with an extra shirt...The shirt is a small, but it won't matter if you plan of framing it. So I was wondering if anyone here wants it, if multiple people reply then I have to work out who to give it to, so either a random person or we can do a bid, so if you want it please just reply yes and vote if you want a random selection to choose who gets it or a bid.This shirt cost $30 AUD ($23.42 USD) and postage to USA costs $15.50 AUD ($11.71 USD), so total $45.5 AUD ($35.51 USD)

I've been looking for a while and many articles have mentioned pre-order statistics and sales for one or another game is the highest this year etc. Was just wondering where could I find statistics and market sales such as these?I would also be interested to see monthly console sales, but so far it looks like the only page counting these sales that's up to date would be the monthly press announcements from the console brands themselves.
3ff1pc	-55496	1438445575	xboxone	Can someone help me out with finding suitable sources for console sales numbers?	I swear it seems like the most hidden information in existence, I have searched pretty tirelessly for any website of regularly updated posts that give me accurate sales numbers on current-gen consoles, where do people get this information from month after month with the "PS4 beats Xbox One in sales in the month of July", "Xbox One beats PS4 in sales in the month of April", WHERE ARE THESE NUMBERS COMING FROM?! I can't find a source ANYWHERE, the only mention of a source would be "NPD" whatever that means, apparently they upload sales data every month of console sales in the US, however when I visit their website I find no information of that kind.In other words, in what dark corner of the internet can I find the sales numbers of current gen consoles as soon as they are released, where are the original sources?

Ok, so I made it a goal of mine to go to RTX as soon as possible, which is this year since I turned 18 late last year. I just have some (stupid) questions as all of this is a lot to handle on my own going international while organising everything.You're gonna laugh, but, what the hell do I eat? I mean, I would imagine the restaurants would be too expensive and that's all I see around my hotel, I can't see any supermarkets (or groceries) anywhere close by, not even a 7/11 and my hotel is pretty much next to the convention centre, also, I'm traveling from Australia if that means anything. It's so weird and stupid to ask of how to obtain a basic human necessity, something I would have no worries about flying inter-state, but this is another country, I don't even know if you're meant to tip the Uber drivers, should I even take an Uber? CAN I even take an Uber to and from the airport? I have no idea, and I know it's stupid to leave these questions this late but it's something that I had completely overlooked because it seemed so basic.
3fsrpn	-55496	1438724442	roosterteeth	What are line estimates this year at RTX?	So, Barbara mentioned that you should line up for large panels 1 hour before they start and 25 minutes for smaller panels, however last year I've heard numerous people say they had to line up for 4 or more hours to get a seat in the panel, is something different this year? Or should you line up for large panels like RWBY and AH 4 or more hours earlier?

3hhi1m	-55496	1439926416	xboxone	How/can I transfer everything from my current Xbox to my new Xbox (halo edition) when it arrives?	I am contemplating buying the awesome Halo themed Xbox One as I'm a huge halo fan but I already own a day one Xbox One edition console, if i did purchase the halo themed console would it be easy to transfer everything from that console to my new one? I have a couple of games stored locally with the large majority of my games being physical, I also have an external 2tb hard drive attached that has a good portion of data on it, how can I transfer everything from my original Xbox to my new one?Also, has any halo fan like me run into problems when trying to get all the awesome collectors’ items? So I pre-ordered the collectors limited edition of halo 5 that includes the statue, but I also want the console, I can't have both without paying a shitload of money when I would be getting some things twice. You see the console bundle includes a limited edition of the game but not the collector’s edition (with the statue), I also would much rather a physical disc that I can keep in my steel book case but the console comes with a download code instead, has anyone found an optimal solution to a halo collector like me?

This is just an example design I quickly made without a header image using the Naut theme, it has some small tweaks I put in (like no down vote button) etc., if you wanted to apply this theme to this subreddit you just have to copy over the CSS coding and download and re-upload the sprite sheet and other images used in the CSS stylesheet.&amp;nbsp;Then you can input your own images, like a better background and your own header image (it has to be 1920 by 416) and has to be under 500kb (for memory) to upload.

167zp9	-55509	1357696745	gamegrumps	A few thoughts on what the relationship between fans and the Grump's families should be...	For starters, let me just say that I have no definitive opinion on the idea just yet. These are just some thoughts sparked by a few recent posts on reddit as well as other places. I implore you to simply think about the idea and discuss if you feel inclined.Recently it has come to my attention that there have been a few instances of claimed GameGrumps fan interaction with the families of the Grumps. Especially with Arin's family, there seems to have been a lot of suggested contact. Whether or not these stories are true, it does bring up an interesting question: How far is to far regarding these people?I do not mean to say that I have the answer. Of course there's the idea of basic courtesy but beyond that, it's really up to Grumps and their families to say what's too far outside of that. On one side of the spectrum, we have the (again, claimed, as in people could just be pretending to meet the families or people could be pretending to be related) we have interesting stories about people having conversations with people like Arin's dad on twitter, or positive responses from his mother on youtube. On the other end of the spectrum, we have an apparent story that claimed some personal details of Jon that were deemed intrusive for others to know. (If you are aware of what these issues are, I would ask you not to bring up what they are for the sake of the decency the mods are trying to promote).So what do we do? Is it wrong to seek communication with those so close to the Grumps? Is it okay if the people in question seem open to it? How much knowledge of the Grumps is too much, too personal?Finnally, as a sort of side note, I would say give these people more respect than you would even Jon or Arin. They didn't ask to be famous because of them. Jon and Arin almost definitely know t that rude behavior is an inevitability on the Internet and it is (though not deserved) to be expected when they put themselves out there. But these people have not directly put themselves out their for *us,* and I think we should respect that even more.But what do you think?

I know that some of you at least remember when the gush of "Vote GameGrumps for the Shorty Awards" posts came out about a month ago, but the contest in nearly over. There are only two days left, so if you haven't yet, and you want to head over here...[Shorty Awards in Gaming] (http://shortyawards.com/category/gaming)and go through the tweeting process to cast your vote.Just some information about the contest: It does look like they take into account and act on their rules, as a few months ago our biggest competitors had +3000 and +2000 respectively, and now they are at +2000 and +1000 respectively. The judges will look at the top 6 nominees regardless of votes, but the more votes GG gets the better they look.Unfortunatly, however, there is a chance that we'll be beaten out by Sims in a sort of technicallity. Sims won last  year, and the judges may think that a video game franchise is more deserving of the award than those who entertain with video games. Just a forewarning.Also, while we're at it. Vote for Suzy in this fashion contest. She honestly has my vote for her submission, not just because of GameGrumps.

18ohn1	-55509	1361080184	pokemon	Has there been any actual confirmation on the number of new Pokemon there will be?	I've been hearing a lot of people just assuming we'll get another 150, but who's to say? What if we only get 50 like way back in Johto? What if we get less? Would one necessarily be worse than the other? Personally, my biggest problem with 5th gen wasn't that there were bad designs, but that amongst the great ones there was a whole heap of "meh" for me, and I think part of that was because they stretched themselves by making a region with only new Pokemon. But I don't know, they could really pull it off depending on what ideas they're gonna put in this new game. What do you guys think? 
19g1nw	-55509	1362113378	gamegrumps	I know, I know. Another fan trying to make some grand project but as Treeko says "Hear me out guys"	I've seen a few project being posted here, and I do not meant to step on anyone's toes in the slightest. Let me explain: one day I got to thinking about what if GameGrumps did have a musical, sparked from conversation of the subject around, and after a late night of trying to fall asleep I accidentally created the framework for one. Since it's there, I decided I might as well go through with it. I've come up with about 15 song ideas (only a few are remixes) and an overall arc for it. I was thinking about going in the style of vignettes, just short bits and pieces to cover all that GameGrumps would have to offer.Here's a list as far as songs go, it's basically my notes that pertain to the songs. The amount of lyrical writing on these varies, but I've got basic concepts for most of them. They are tentatively put in the order I think they would appear.Hey I’m Grump: Jon and Arin introduce themselves and each other as they come together to meet for a session of GameGrumps.Pause Balls?: Jon and Arin begin their session of Game Grumps.Emotional Claws: Arin is forced to wear a ridiculous costume because of Suzy’s latest fashion craze, and sings a song about the issues it has caused him that day. It turns out to be a misunderstanding.Suzy the Goose?:  A song by SuzyBig Ol’…:  When Jon has to go to the bathroom before starting an episode of GameGrumps, Arin gets bored and decides to sing a song about his…. Well…The Ballad of Barry: Barry sings a song about feeling underappreciated, which descends into rage until he receives a ton of fan mail and consolation from Arin and JonBanana Shoes: Jon and Arin receive a pair of Banana Shoes from a fan in their mailbag, and, secretly from each other do an extravagant dance in them out of sheer joy. Also the closing number for Act 1Real Talk: I just feel like there should be a song called Real TalkOne Big Happy Family: Jon and Arin invite all of their internet friends going to a convention to a dinner out, and they are all excited to go.We Can’t Be Recognized: Jon and Arin have to quickly make it back to their flight away from the convention, but must get though the fans without being recognized and stopped.Home at Last: Arin and Jon make it home and are exhausted, and then reminisce about GameGrumps and their friendship.I’m not so Grump: Closing song, a sort of reprise of the opening.Other Potential Songs:Suzy the Goose: Suzy feels conflicted about Arin’s work on GameGrumps, concerned that it may come between the time they've meant to spend together.Sick Day: The Grumps get sick and mope about as their condition deteriorates and have an argument about whose fault it is that both of them are sick.The Dream: Jon and Arin both have a strange dream that involves the fabricated relationship created by their fans and themselves. Hey Beowulf: Jon and Arin get hounded by some stuck-ups about how they don’t have “real jobs” and therefore must be dumb. Jon then proceeds to get literary on them with this little diddy from his past.So that's basically where I am right now, and I wanted to take an opportunity to ask the other GameGrumps fans if they'd like a piece of the metaphoric pie. Any ideas, short stories (it's a bunch of vignettes after all) are welcome. Heck, even song ideas! Also, I'll be keeping updates on this on a blog, if anyone likes my idea enough to actually care about my ramblings. Thanks for making it this far if you did, I really appreciate it.

Reviewers carries a stigma that they focus more on rating the game than being enteraing, and Let's Playing comes with a whole heapload of I've heard the term "Content Creators" before, but that's really broad. Is there some sort of term one could use, or is it just such a unique thing person to person that you really can't generalize it with a term?

1awcib	-55509	1364098013	NormalBootsUnited	Who am I?	Years ago when I was just a young'un, I found James Rolfe and Doug Walker, The Angry Video Game Nerd and The Nostlagia Critic respectively. It fostered a desire in my middle school mind to do what they did, making videos that people enjoyed. Time went on and I became fans of others, and moved through different fandoms like ChuggaConroy, Linkara, Blistered Thumbs, Yogscast, before finally landing on the NormalBoots gang. And I can see that reflected through my content over the years, from skit videos to Let's Plays to movie reviews to podcasts to comedy game videos, I like to think I've dipped my toes in a lot of metaphorical grape squashing barrels.Even though those a part of NormalBoots are still around and still thrive and have kept their ties, I was saddened by it's closing last year. I came up with this subreddit to carry on the idea that I felt really made the NormalBoots group great: The co-operation of "Content Creators" to better their content and to help each other get quality content out there. That's what I hope to achieve here. I'm in it partially for the same reasons you might be; I will fully admit that I want to make my content better and more popular. That being said, none of us can do it alone and hopefully we all can become better at this whole Youtube-Internet thing we have going on. I look forward to seeing what anyone and everyone has to offer. Stick around.Who am I? I'm just your Average Joe-Reviewer. Trying to make his mark by helping others make theirs. 
1awepi	-55509	1364100548	NormalBootsUnited	Here's an example of an appropriate direct video link: The Making of an Angry Video Game Nerd Episode	
1ay8eb	-55509	1364178713	NormalBootsUnited	What kind of equipment should you use? (Editing, Sound, Recording)	This is a question I see a ton in all sorts of places, though generally it is people asking specific Content Creators what *they* use. And since I've seen (and used) quite a lot of these different things, I may as well share with you what I've learned.Video Editing:Adobe Premier- I haven't used this one personally, but for many NormalBoots people such as JonTron this is the go-to editing software. On the plus side, it works with a lot of other Adobe products, saving your work across the different programs. On the other hand, you have to buy those other programs for it to work with them. Apparently, it is very intuitive, but also may have some strange glitches.Sony Vegas- The other most utilized software, and what I use personally. Not to say that it is better, when I bought it I had no idea about Premier. However, it is used by people such as NintendoCapriSun and (last time I checked at least) Spoony, as well as a few other lesser known people. The best way to describe it is that Vegas is reliable where Premier is intuitive. You can generally do the same things with both, but it's a lot easier to do it in Adobe from what I've heard. However, Adobe is more likely to mess up for no reason while the ways of editing, though sometimes contrived, have always consistently worked for me after I found out how to do it. However, these differences really only show up if you are doing somewhat sophisticated effects, and honestly I'd just suggest getting whichever you can get for less money if you are thinking simpler. However, if you have no budget...Windows Movie Maker and iMovie (or whatever the standard Macintosh Software is)- If you're on a hard budget you gotta do what you gotta do, and sometime what you gotta do is Cheap-As-Free. If you're looking at this it's probably obvious to you why it's your choice, but I would ask you not to be discouraged if this is where you are. Remember: LittleKuriboh used Movie Maker to make the first of his fathering Abridged Series. My personal advice would be to keep your footage as plain as possible and not try to work out effects with Movie Maker because it makes it really obvious what you are doing. Just try to keep what you are doing simple and let *you* drive the quality, not your effects.Also, iMovie was counter-intuative as crap to me, but that's probably a Mac/Pc thing. It's got a lot of options, but I could barely make the thing work for me. Ah well, to each their own.Other- I believe there is a better Macintosh editing program but I'll be darned if I can remember.Video Recording (Console/TV)Haupaugge HD PVR: Probably the most sophisticated of your basic capture device, the Haupauge is the choice of the Game Grumps as well as many other prolific console gamers. It is specifically designed for the 360 and PS3, but it'll work with just about anything from at least GameCube and probably further back honestly. However, it is a bit pricey running at about $100 at cheapest unsued. You also need to have a fairly powerful computer to run it well, as it records directly to your computer. However, it comes with everything you need and the setup, from what I can tell, is very simple and just involves plugging your console into the PVR, then the PVR into your TV and the USB into you PC. That sounds more complicated than it actually is take my word for it.Dazzle- The Dazzle is another device that's a bit more economical, but also a bit more tricky. It doesn't come with all the wires you need so you'll need to get your own splitter cables, but it's about $40 cheaper than the PVR. However, I got one, though it was at a significant discount so it may have been an older/more faulty model, and the software completely wrecked my admittedly average laptop. However, the quality is decent so you can give it a try.Camera on TV- Eh... It can be done... I guess. Again, you're often stuck with what you got, especially when it comes to you younger folk, but this is a much more significant blow to your quality than Movie Maker would be. If you're gonna do this through, take ABSOLUTELY EVERY MEASURE YOU CAN TO MAKE THAT TV PICTURE LOOK AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE ON YOUR CAMERA. If we can't see the screen well then there is no point. But, and I really don't like to say this but this is one of the few times where it's necessary, you really really aren't going to get anywhere with just using your camera to film your TV, no matter how good your actual gameplay, commentary, jokes WHATEVER. People are immediately turned off by this method more than anything, so just be forewarned.Video Recording (PC):Fraps: It's what the professionals use, that's about all I can say. I've heard tell of it being somewhat glitchy or something, but if everyone on the PBG Hardcore series seems to use it, it's probably okay if you can afford it.Camstudio: A Cheap-As-Free option that isn't utter crap (also I use it.) Camstudio is a little bit glitchy though, and the way it saves can lead to some easy accidental deletions of files, but for no money it's a great friend. You can adjust quality to FPS ratios to fit your preference, and generally I find the quality to be okay. And it doesn't come with any water marks.Other: There are a lot of other free options out there, but most of them are either trial versions with a watermark or trial versions with time limits.Audio Recording (for your voice) :Microphones- Look, the fact of the matter is that there are so many microphones from here to Timbuktu and I rarely find any consistency and honestly, as long as you have something that resembles a microphone you'll probably be okay. In fact, it's probably more important to pay attention to your recording surroundings. Hard surfaces reflect sound and make the quality echoes, so through blankets around if you have to. However...Audacity: Cheap-As-Free and a goto for many, Audacity is a great program for taking your microphone input. It keeps it at a very good and accessible quality, and there are simple ways to go about saving your data if it happens to crash. And, if you're stuck using something unrefined for your post production, it can allow for a bit of editing itself as well. Generally though, you're gonna want to do that in your editing software if you can.And that's my shpeel. If you have any other suggestions or think I'm completely wrong about some of these, let us know!

Now, clearly it's not the stereotypical "Hello, thank you for calling Game Grumps headquarters this is Suzy," type deal, but I was always curious as to what that meant really. Does anyone with a better idea of business and titles (or anyone else for that matter) think/know what she might do? She or someone may have mentioned it before but if they did I missed it. Just curious is all.
1bmcsi	-55509	1365029299	gamegrumps	A New /r/NormalBoots! Except it's not... (/r/NormalBootsUnited official announcement)	Hello /r/GameGrumps, I'm sure many of you are aware of the unfortunate closing of /r/NormalBoots to the public, with the rather harsh message left for us fans. Well, a few months ago I had had an idea that I had hoped to pitch to /r/Normalboots to give them a little bit more direction, as really it seemed to me that the subreddit lacked purpose. However, now that it is closed, I took matters into my own hands and made /r/NormalBootsUnited, which you may have noticed in the subreddit sidebar./r/NormalBootsUnited is my way of carrying on the torch of one of the key and most appealing ideas of NormalBoots: Collaboration. It was the working together and cooperation between such great Content Creators that made NormalBoots what it was, and that's part of what I hope I can capture. As of right now, pretty much anything you might feel appropriate is okay to post right now as we're trying to fleash out what works and what doesn't. However, I will quote from our rules page saying that *this is not a direct replacement for /r/Normalboots* . It may have the opportunity to return, and I don't want to take that away. As such, it's not really a place to post videos of the NB guys but if you're really interested then you can just take a look at the rules.I've had things going for a while and we've been able to get things started so you can see where we're going. We've had quite a few people posting their own content to be reviewed and a couple discussions about the processes behind making a show. Come join us if you are interested in bettering your own content, learning about some of the parts of the process of making a show, or just want to hang in a place where people think about those types of things. If you have any questions, message either me or your familiar also-Game-Grumps-subreddit-mod Xandan! Thanks for your time!/r/NormalBootsUnited
1bs6vr	-55509	1365225450	NormalBootsUnited	A bit of update: Mod Talk and Other Subreddit stuff	Hey everybody, it's your friendly ModMan just coming out to tell you all a few things.For starters, I never thought I'd see such a reaction so fast! We've almost got 150 readers as of now, and that's great and fantastic!So, now comes the awkward issue of having to deal with all this. As a mod and facilitator of discussion, ideally I'd like to watch and reply to every single piece of content that gets posted here. However, things have been picking up exponentially, we had about 5 posts today when before we were luck if we got 2, that's a significant increase when you factor in that these are generally videos about 15-30 minutes in length sometimes (a future topic btw, you probably know what I'll talk about if you've read some of my recent comments).Now, this is a problem that coincides with a discussion: Mods. People want to be them, it's a cool thing to think about. I have been asked a bit what sort of requirements one needs to be a mod. Well, let me tell you step one:We need to need a Mod.Now you might say, "JoeReviewer! Clearly you need more mods in order to reach all the content." But I don't, I just need people. I don't get nearly enough "Mod Only" stuff to justify delegating it to other people, and personally I like having a bit of control over this, call me a bit egotistical if you want. Xandan and I have been in a bit of discussion about improving the subreddit and he's the one behind your fancy new orange Flairtext (Thank him btw he's awesome) and that's about all we need.But, I would like to request your help. For this community to flourish, we need constant feedback and exchanges coming around. That's why I humbly ask you to really put it in your minds to try and offer feedback on people's stuff if you can. Honestly, if everyone that's been directly involved around here comments on one of the videos posted every day, that'd be a great facilitator of the kind of discussion and collaboration I hope to achieve with this subreddit. Talk to each other, discuss with each other, for *goodness sake* **disagree** with each other from time to time :P. Ideally, we'd have everyone almost constantly talking back and forth establishing connections (networking, another post topic). Realistically, that's a little silly to think but hey, a mod can dream can't he?Keep on keepin' on guys, you are doing great and better than I could have imagined in such a short time. I am amazingly grateful to be such a large part of this and I thank everyone who has offered their voice or content in order to help this community grow. Who knows where we will be lead, only time will tell.In case tl;dr is your thing:-Subreddit growing fast is awesome-Soon you guys will be posting more content than I can realistically watch (another post topic, regarding responding to your audience). This is a good problem to have.-We don't need mods, but we need people posting like the mod does. This proceeds to probably make little sense and make me seem power hungry but oh well.-Xandan is awesome cause he can make orange words.-You guys are awesome and thank you.

Even if you don't like it, it's probably one of the most important developments in our side of the Internet right now.Now, what I've been seeing is a lot more negativity with this than other EgoRaptor videos. Sure, there's still a metric ton of people who loved it, and I really liked it as well, but there's a vocal group that didn't, ranging from well thought out critiques to "THIS TOOK A YEAR TO MAEK LOL"Now, regardless of what you think of the video, how do you think you would handle this sort of situation?  A video that was another installment of a previously viral bombing one that was hyped for months and that you poured your heart and soul into meeting such controversial acceptance. It's an important thing to think about, because we might be in this position one day, if we're lucky.It's hard to say what will happen from now, but I do wish Arin the best of luck in the coming days, I have a feeling it may be a little rough for him.

Now, we've been working together trying to get an emulator internet netplay thing going so that it can be shown to people who want to participate who don't necessarily have someone they can play with. However, we have come into some issues. Issue the first: The boop on Zsnes is wrong. Just... wrong. I don't even know, it's just a higher pitch and we can't figure out why and we honestly can't do the game justice without the right boop! That's madness! So that led to problem number 2:We can't get SNES9X to work on netplay, we tried for over an hour. It reportedly has issues, but we can't even get a connection registered at all, just telling us that it's trying to connect at 0%. We've tried working through Hamachi as a last resort and even then we still can't get it to work. So here's the skinny:Can any of you guys help in this regard? Anything honestly would help, Schizo would really like to be able to get this going and set up before the Game Grumps anniversary gets too close. If you can fix the sound on zsnes, or know the ins and outs of SNES9x's netplay, or have any other experience that could help, please contact /u/schizostrife or comment here. We appreciate any help you can give!
1de2ne	-55509	1367295191	NormalBootsUnited	My recent activity.	You may have noticed that I haven't been as active around here as I used to, and I just wanted to put out there a few reasons for your digestion.1. Big secret project based partly on the survery results. I can't say more though.2. Exams. Particularly AP next week. Honestly I would really appreciate it if you guys could sort of cover for me so I can focus on my studies until after May 15th, then things will be calm again for sure.3. I don't genearly post long critiques on videos of people who have posted before. Generally because a lot of it's the same and most people improve on the points I mention as well as others. I do still watch every video that comes through here though, so don't worry about that.Anyways, that's the gist. If you have any questions or comments feel free as always to contact me. Thanks again for being such awesome people!

Better to just laugh at the situation than get upset about it.)(All episodes are based off of actual experience.1. Don't worry about spelling or grammar. Your point is much to important to convey to waste time worrying about that! Make sure you also replace words such as "you" with "u" and similar to show your opponent how well you can grasp the English language even if you limit yourself.2. Make sure to point out that your opponent is objectively wrong about everything they say. You must be write, why else would you be taking time out of your busy, important life of watching people on the Internet when all they do is make free content for consumption.3. Make sure to make gigantic, hyperbolic declarations and comparisons in order to dwarf your opponents opinions. For example, comparing parts of a Game Boy game to a similar one on the NES released *earlier* is about as ridiculous as making a comparison between the NES and the Wii U which are separated by more than 20 years in the right direction. Clearly.4. Be sure to make assumptions about you're opponents sexual orientation. Do they utilize pixel art? They must have a sexual obsession with Minecraft. Did I mention that all things with Pixel art come from Minecraft? That's important, it created the medium!    a. Make sure you make fun of them for this too, this will surely demoralize them to the point where they will see how wrong they were in life and understand how great your factual opinion is.5. Be sure to be the better man and end the argument yourself by countering your opponents points as above and then refusing to even hear any more of their side of the argument. Clearly, the 13th reply is just taking things too far, and their opinions are stupid anyways so why have a chance to refute them?------------------------------------------------In all seriousness, I love these people. It's great to delve deep into discussion and just find out what makes some people tick and get them to vocalize their arguments to see where they are coming from, even if they don't express it in the nicest of ways. It also gives you a chance to express things that you may never have thought of because  you thought it would be ridiculous to bring it up in the first place. Don't let these get you down, enjoy them! :)(Would you want more of this? Would it just be something I do, or something you all would like to participate in?)
1dttrj	-55509	1367885379	pokemonzetaomicron	The beginning of the game is crucial:	I just wanted to speak from experience with a nameless romhack, but be very delibarate when you are designing the beginning of the game. The developers made a lot of choices there that are really beneficial to those playing both Pokemon or the particular version for the first time.1. Start off with smaller parts of grass. Grinding on a bunch of wild Pokemon should be an option very early on, not nessesary just by walking. 2. There should be about 2 easy Pokemon to catch almost immediately. Again, they can be cannon fodder or assets to the team, but let the player choose that. Don't decide "This way is better/harder so I'm going to do that" Giving the players the option to sort of choose their difficulty is a good part of a lot of games.a. The Pokemon also shouldn't be too strong compared to the others. Generally there's a Normal type that can also function as an HM slave if needed. A little later in the game, there's always the tried and true method of throwing in a bug type or two. These Pokemon should also learn a good amount of moves early on, I've seen really low level Pokemon that basically can't do anything because they're a fire type but all they can use is tackle.3. Put short distances between healing spots early on. As the player is building up their team, give them a little space to test and try things out without too much consequence.4. Early trainers generally should have simply stronger/more Pokemon that are already in the area, especially since type advantages aren't really something they can cater to.5. Try to save the first forest/cave/dungeon type thing until after the first gym, because by that point it's likely that the player has a fairly decently built team to tackle something a little longer like a cave full of Zubats and Geodudes.6. After the 2nd gym, go hog-wild. At this point, the trainer should easily be able to have a solid team of 6 and their personal experience will develop from there.Anyways, those are my pseudo-tips just based from experience. Take them as you wish, some may be silly contrivances but I think they are pretty important for not making the beginning of your game really frustrating. If you've already gotten past this that's not my beef, just wanted to put this out there.Edit: Screw Reddit's Automatic numbering system.

1eoa7t	-55509	1369021937	NormalBootsUnited	I need your halp with some tech stuff before I make the monetary commitment.	Okay, some of you have heard me talk a lot about how I feel silly giving out all this advice without actually having a longrunning show of my own. Well, starting this summer, a long with a lot of other things, my friend and I are going to start a show called "Not Dating Gaming." where we, as if it's a surpise, play games and talk over them. Dana (the friend) and I are just about ready to start, and we've done some stuff together to practice on my channel if you feel so free to look into that, but that's not what I'm here to discuss; this is just to give you context for my question.So, we've basically chosen the Haupagge HDPVR to do the television recording, as we figure it will be able to handle from the GameCube to the PS3 and WiiU (though the whole Nintendo this is certainly a debacle we may have to deal with). Anyways, I have a TV with standard connections (we have an HDTV but for some reason it only plays TV in HD, we can't plug an HD input into it; it doesn't have the slots). My computer is a laptop, Toshiba. Dual core processors, 2GB RAM. The thing can run Portal 2 okay, if that's any indication, but it's nothing high end.Is this an okay/compatible purchase? I bought a Dazzle once and it nearly fried my computer when I tried to use it. Any tech knowledge before I make the purchase would be vastly appreciated.~JoeReviewer A.K.A ModManSupreme

1fb3hr	-55509	1369876984	NormalBootsUnited	A new thing I want you guys to be comfortable doing.	Alright, so one of the things I wanted to do is help people with some of the basic things that go into video production. One of the key things about working with videos is getting footage from games. However, sometimes one only needs a brief, 3 second clip that just contains a scene from the game, and if it's near the end then it can feel tedious to go through the whole game just for one piece of footage, especially if it doesn't need specific details other than being from that game or part of that game. Therefore, I propose that we think about developing a backlog of "stock footage" that's open to any content creators that simply need a bit of footage from a game, whether it be to make a brief aside or to just need some background material with a little context. Obviously though, there are two caveats here. One is that if this thing already exists then this would be redundant, however I might put it out there that people who may have already developed this may have water marks on the videos in order to link back to the content, whereas I would simply propose that we ask that we are reference in a description of the video if such content was used. And I wouldn't be mad if someone didn't do that anyways.The other thing is that it might not work. Many people take notes when they record things that would be lost when they play games, but  there may be other things. So, I suggest a little experiment: Some of you may have heard me talk about my "Giant Flying Manta Ray Song" and I am happy to say it has all been recorded, but I lack the ability to record decent quality footage of the stage. If someone could record themsevles playing through New Super Mario Bros. Wii 5-5, along with entering the level from the world map, I would not only be grateful, but we could see if such a thing could work.If this does work out, we could potentially have a gigantic database of game footage that could simply be donated from LP's or footage recording sessions. It could be a great tool. But what do you guys think?
1fjy1x	-55509	1370223649	NormalBootsUnited	A quick note on the amount of content being posted	Okay, so, hate to be the bad guy here, but I figure I need to lay down the ground rules for a few things here. There has been a bit of an influx of the same people posting content around, and I realize that I haven't made something expressly clear. I know it sounds mean to tell people to stop posting as often, but NBU was designed to be a place for critique. To many videos from the same people, even if critique is wanted, more often just informs people about a new video as if they were subscribed. Rather, it would be more beneficial for critiquing purposes to see videos from a longer period of time, as the changes in quality would be more drastic and easily noticeable.However, I'm no tyrant. This is as much your subreddit as it is mine. So what do you guys think? How often should someone post their own content? I'm inclined to say at least a week. And should scheduling matter? Updates seem unnecessary, if we now a new video comes every Wednesday/Satruday. I'm pretty sure I want to rule out anything that has "Part 2+" in it as a separate post. Should type of video matter? Tell me what you think, and we'll add it too the rules.

1i4uvv	-55509	1373605213	travel	Going to stay with a family in Lyon with a layover in London, anything I should know?	Some context: So, this Saturday I begin my journey to Lyon (France) for about 2.5 weeks. My flight leaves at 9:30pm, with a layover in the London airport on the way. I'm travelling alone. I've been brushing up on my French a bit (I've taken up to French 4 in highschool, but it wasn't a very rigorous class.) The family I'm staying with, friends with my family for 3 generations, can speak English well, but I really want to avoid as much English as possible so I can really come to better understand the language.I guess what I'm trying to ask is that is there anything I should know before going that I might not be able to find looking on regular guides? Most places I find show desinations, or hotels to go to, but I'm more interested in just observing the culture and spending time understanding the family. But I'm not sure if there's any cultural things I may be missing. I'm also a little worried about potential differences in London, since they have a few key different words and really, I just don't want to be *that* American.Anything you can tell me will be much appreciated, help a first time solo traveler out! :)
1j0qqe	-55509	1374749754	gamegrumps	The True and Tragic Past of Sad Hoshi (Silius-Part 5)	A long time ago, back in his homeland of Japan, Hoshi Morkioka was happily married and had two lovely daughters of 4 and 8 years. Both Hoshi and his wife worked diligently to provide for their family, as they scraped along each day to afford sending their children to school. Hoshi also had a dream of moving to the United States, where he hoped his developed business skills would allow his family to live more comfortably and allow his wife to spend time with their children instead of working for extra cash to keep them from falling into poverty. Hoshi would spend much of his extra time and days off teaching his family English so that they could live happily in America.Eventually, Hoshi pulled overtime and his wife did a few more low-paying jobs and, with a little bit of support from Hoshi's family, they were able to make it plausible to immigrate to America. Hoshi was able to make preparations, get his family an apartment to live in, and had tied up all of his working commitments. However, his wife was still under obligation to her jobs until the end of the month. Hoshi's wife, knowing how much Hoshi had dreamed to bring his family to the land of prosperity, urged Hoshi to go with their two daughters ahead of her, and she would join them when she could. Hoshi and his daughters made it to America, but soon after tragedy struck, and Hoshi's life would be thrown into turmoil.The flight that was to bring Hoshi's wife to America crashed, leaving Hoshi as a widower. The pain struck him hard, as he blamed himself for not waiting with his wife for another flight, or even for wishing to go to America in the first place. His grief made his search for work difficult, and some nosy neighbors, who didn't take too kindly to Hoshi, sent in Child Services to investigate Hoshi's home. Unfortunately, Hoshi and his children were unable to communicate clearly their grief, and Child Services declared that Hoshi had put his children into some sort of psychological trauma and, coupled with Hoshi's inability to get a job, saw it fit to remove them from his care. Hoshi was confused, devastated, and still hadn't developed English well enough to fight against this.Years passed and Hoshi's business skills got him the high paying job that we know of today. However, he was never able to understand the system that took his children away and all attempts to get them back were fruitless. Hoshi remarried, but never told his wife of his past because he doesn't want to burden her with such tragedy. As he often said, "Some battles you just have to fight alone." Hoshi's new wife always puts off having children whenever it was brought up in conversation, and Hoshi is always too struck with guilt and grief to push harder for it, even though he secretly dreams of being a father again and hoping to make up for his mistakes.Hoshi still has an album of many pictures of his family, but early on in his new relationship, he convinced his wife that it was a book of pedophilia, to ensure that she would never investigate and learn the tragic truth. This pains Hoshi to no end, but he does not wish to give such pain to the woman he loves. You can often hear Hoshi exclaiming encouragement to the pictures of his daughters in particular, remembering fondly getting his youngest a swimsuit she wanted dearly for her 4th birthday. He remembers working with his eldest on her math homework, and struggling together to overcome her troubles with learning long division. Sometimes, when his wife is nearby, he exclaims sexual things in order to perpetuate his facade, but most often he is happily remembering the time he spent with his family.And so, Hoshi continues this relentless battle. Alone.

1lo00j	-55509	1378240130	NoStupidQuestions	How would I be able to tell if a tech company was trying to cheat me out of money or at least keep them from doing it?	So, my Toshiba computer's fan has stopped working, and I'm almost sure that it's because it became disloged or stuck or something, because it was in a bag a few days ago and someone pushed it off a table onto the floor by accident. I have an external fan (that goes under the computer) that keeps it cool for now, but there's this constant "Warning" Pop-up that stops everything I'm doing and appears at like every couple of minutes, if not more frequently.Again, I'm next to postitive that the fan is just jammed or something, but this issue has also been attributed to a motherboard issue... and I don't want to have to spend more money and waste more time because someone wanted to make extra money by charging me for a motherboard when that wasn't the problem. I also need this computer daily and I don't want to have to wait weeks for them to get the right part.Is there nothing to worry about? Am I exaggerating my fears? Is there a simple fix to this? Any advice would be very appreciated.
1loq0h	-55509	1378259775	techsupport	Checking/Fixing a Laptop Fan	Okay, list of specs: Windows 7, Toshiba Satellite P755-S5320.So my laptop has had a loud whirring fan for about a year, ever since I had to take it in for a corrupted harddrive. I sent it in to Best Buy and got it back a while later, with the loud fan. However, recently the computer took a bit of a fall (someone knocked it off the desk) and now it seems as though the fan isn't working anymore. This wouldn't be that much of a problem, my family has had an external fan (that goes under the laptop) for quite some time and it has been keeping the computer cool, but I now get this message poppup that says "Warning: A problem has occurred with the cooling system has been detected.  Please turn off the computer immediately, and return it for service." If I close it, it just pops up again in 30 seconds. I've put it off to the side of my computer for now so it doesn't keep popping up, but if I try to close it I have to close a popup window for every 30 since.I'm nearly sure the fan must be jostled or something, as it didn't seem to be in the best position when I got this laptop back. Some searches indicate that this could be some issue where the motherboard isn't reading the PC status right or something, but I find that doubtful since the "Toshiba PC Health Monitor" can read my computer's temperature just fine. Speaking of the Health Monitor, it also says that my fan is spinning at 0% except every once in a while where it will jump up to 11 or 20 or something.I have tried to exert pressure on the computer to see if I could get the fan going, to no avail. It seems like it sometimes tries to start, but then doesn't, though for all I know that could be something with the processors that always made that sound. I've done a system restore to before the problem, which didn't do anything. I honestly don't want to have to spend a lot of money if I don't have too, and I'm worried that whoever I'll give it too will just say I need to replace the motherboard and take the computer for like a week while they replace parts and stuff. I have no experience with taking computers apart and every video I've been able to look up about cleaning fans seems to involve basically disassembling the whole computer, though I feel like with all the little panels on the bottom of this thing, there should be one that goes right to the fan.Well, that's about as much detail as I can give. Any advice on what to do from here would be much appreciated! (Also, I'll edit in any specs that are needed, I think I got everything in the sidebar but this is my first time posting here so I'm not sure.)

This Saturday, Norman finally worked up the courage to go into the store to get the screen fixed. The man working there said that his phone was a really old model, and that he could get a much more recent version with his current plan. He showed Norman how a new phone would be able to easily connect to the internet, keep all his old contacts, and have the ability to make group calls with up to 4 people. Norman thanked him for his time.Norman walked over to the cashier, she was a tall, redheaded woman wearing the standard blue uniform. It looked like she had some sort of sparkling lip-gloss on. Norman made sure not to make eye contact with her so he wouldn't embarrass himself. She asked him if he found everything he needed, and he said yes. He stuck the receipt in his wallet in the slot where all the other ones were and drove home.That night, Norman took out his old phone, now with a fixed, uncracked screen. He then placed the new shatter protecting case around the phone. He hoped he'd never have to go back to that store again.Later as he was falling asleep, Norman wondered whether or not the woman would have felt weird with all that glitter on her lips.

Here is a list of Inafune's titles for each of the classic Mega Man games.Mega Man – Character designerMega Man 2 – Character designMega Man 3 – Character design, sub planningMega Man 4 – Planner, special designerMega Man 5 – Object designer, adviserMega Man 6 and Mega Man 7 – Object designerMega Man 8 and Mega Man &amp; Bass – ProducerMega Man Powered Up – Executive producerMega Man 9 – Producer, character designerMega Man 10 – ProducerWhile he certainly may have had more involvement than his titles would say, it seems weird to say that Mega Man could not possibly continue without him, and that games he works on will be just like the old Mega Man games. Mega Man 2 and 3 strike me as interesting too, since that's where he allegedly had the least involvement yet those are usually regarded as the favorites. It's mostly the same for the X series as well.I don't know, I just hear everyone going around with Mighty No. 9 and stuff saying that wherever Inafune goes that's where Mega Man games will be, and therefore Capcom can't make another good Mega Man game without him. But there are a lot of people responsible for a game and some, I might dare to say, had even more to do with the success of the games. (Akira Kitamura?)But hey, maybe I'm just spouting nonsense or I'm just plain wrong. What do you guys think? Are there pieces to the puzzle that I am missing?

36dkrl	-55509	1431962381	Megaman	Discussion: What are the hardest and easiest platforming Mega Man games?	By platforming games, I mean like ones in the Classic series, X series, GameBoy series, ECT. Stuff such as Battle Network or Mega Man Soccer would not be included simply because I feel they're too different styles of game to really compare.Alternatively, if you wanted to say the easiest and hardest of battle network and the like, that'd be fine too.
36l5x2	-55509	1432097705	NormalBootsUnited	State of the Subreddit Megathread	Hey everybody, I just wanted to say first and foremost thanks for using the subreddit! You've probably noticed that I haven't been incredibly active here, for reasons I'll explain later, but it makes me glad to know that this place still fills a need even without my direct involvement. However, hopefully that involvement part will change a bit soon, as I am about to highlight.I've divided things into a few sections so you can focus on what you care about.*So what happened to the sub? Why did you check out for so long?*As the story goes, I first made this subreddit at a time when NormalBoots was disbanded. Additionally, it was on the heels of some difficulties with the official /r/normalboots subreddit, and it had been closed down due to drama. /r/normalboots had been having little engagement at the time, and what I eventually turned into /r/normalbootsunited was originally a suggestion for a way to boost engagement for that sub. When the drama happened, I took to my own devices to see whether or not it was a viable idea. However, at a certain point Normal Boots reformed, and a corresponding official subreddit went back into action. At that point, I got uncomfortable with this subreddit since it seemed to be mooching off the name. I didn't want to step on anyone's toes, and so I sort of let things fall to the wayside on my end. Basically, I didn't want to be that guy who thought he was cool enough to use the NormalBoots name, cause I ain't.  But things didn't run their course or anything, you guys kept posting and the sub kept growing. Now, I've heard mention from a few sources that suggest that NormalBoots type people are at least aware of it enough that if they wanted this place to not be, they would have told me about it. I've made efforts to contact about the situation, but I'm not particularly noteworthy enough to break through the probable loads of spam, actual official business stuff, and generally all around cooler people, so I haven't yet heard anything back. Perhaps I will at some point, but for now I've decided to go until I'm told to stop; no one seems to think I'm a terrible person yet...!*So what exactly are you going to start doing?*Hopefully, espcially now that summer is upon us, I do actually want to try and get to doing more critiques. I've always wanted to get more discussion like that going on people's videos, but that's been admittedly the most difficult goal to achieve while running this sub. However, I do have another method that I will employ to this goal.I'm going to start doing semi-regular discussion threads and opinion pieces. The way I figure, one of the reasons that people don't comment on other people's stuff is that once you've gone and posted your video on the page, there's not much incentive to stick around. Perhaps by including some more text based stuff, which tends to get more engagement, we might get people to stick around longer and maybe migrate over to some users' videos and go and do that critique thing.So we'll see how that goes. I might try to get some friends to write their own opinion pieces, and perhaps other people will be inspired to do so also. I haven't created any rules for these types of posts yet because I want to feel out how they will affect discourse here, if they will at all. I would encourage you to follow a general guideline that if you have a text post on the front page, you should probably wait until it's further down before submitting a new one. *Ask me Questions!*I'm still feeling all this out, and with little comments on the sub it's hard for me to get an idea of what you guys want just from perusing. At the end of the day, all I really want is to keep this from just being a list of videos people are trying to get views for and rather a place where we can actually get better at making our own content.~Just your Average JoeReviewer
36o3ua	-55509	1432152922	NormalBootsUnited	Discussion: Who were your first inspirations?	I figure this is a pretty simple thing to start the series of discussion questions. Who was the person who inspired you to start doing what you do, or some of the early people whom you developed your style from?
381tnq	-55509	1433139283	NormalBootsUnited	Discussion: What game/movie is the most reviewed by critics?	Like Minecraft for Let's Playing, what's the thing that everyone and their brother from another mother has covered, to the point where there's almost nothing new to bring to the table?
39j6zr	-55509	1434076094	NormalBootsUnited	Discussion: What's the best piece of advice you've ever gotten with regards to creating content?	Pretty straight forward, and will perhaps get people in the mentality of giving good advice to others on the sub!
3ar2b2	-55509	1435005475	NormalBootsUnited	Discussion: What's your favorite game/movie/thing that never seems to get any representation?	I'm not really talking about a thing that people cover but the stuff that's out there doesn't include your opinion, but rather something that you really like that no one seems to talk about at all, good or bad. This could be in reviews, let's plays, or even just general discussion.
3cpw5o	-55509	1436474492	NormalBootsUnited	Discussion: What's one thing in a video that can completely turn you off from watching, even if you are interested in the subject matter?	The idea behind this is to find out what gets people to click away from videos they were planning on watching. I've found many times that I've been really interested in the topic of the video, but something like terrible audio pacing or the whole video just being one 10 minute shot of someone talking into a camera with no cuts will cause me to give up and close the video.
3duugg	-55509	1437329990	NormalBootsUnited	Do you like working in a group, or do you prefer to fly solo? Why?	Some people try to get as many people to help with their content as possible, while others try to gain all the skills they need to do everything themselves so that they can streamline. What do you do, and how does that affect how you approach producing content?

spzsf	-55515	1335278163	Industrial	Junction Boxes Protect and Conceal Wiring	It would be hard to imagine the hazards that we would face if not for the junction boxes that protect us from exposure to electrical components and wiring.  Junction boxes are usually constructed from metals such as aluminum and stainless steel, and some are made from polycarbonates or fiberglass.On an industrial scale, junction boxes protect wiring and circuitry from the outdoor elements and from spills, splashes and falling objects within plants and factories.  Some junction boxes and enclosures are even constructed with NEMA standards to keep interior circuitry dry if exposed to a direct flow of liquids, and some are constructed with gaskets that can  prevent the contents from exposure water or other fluids.

I extracted it to the parts folder of my KSP directory as instructed and when I started the game it loaded as usual. I also saw the new rocket parts being loaded in the progress bar. When the secondary load screen appears (black screen with a solar system load icon in the bottom right hand corner), I hear a "ping" and the game freezes. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the game a few times and low and behold the culprit "Rocketry" still loads up in the game start. I searched high &amp; low for "KWRocketry" in my KSP directory &amp; ....nothing. Also not too much luck with the google search, hope you guys can help me get this game playable again, I absolutely love it. Thanks.

grx58	-55532	1303020090	askseddit	Hi, AskSeddit! Wondering about a "real life situation" as a result of a failed/successful f-close..	Hello Seddit! I'm pleased to be both a new user of reddit and of your wonderful community. I planned on lurking for awhile but the material has proven so effective I need advice already. I'm pretty sure the answer is obvious but I haven't come across the situation in other posts I've read/searched so it's worth discussing. [FRAME] ME: 24yr old guy getting back into the dating scene etc after long absence due to traumatic break up. I've been attracted to a girl (HB7) in one of my classes but hadn't really been in the right place mentally and put her way above me. Enter Seddit. I start feeling more socially and sexually confident and soon I've got our whole class hanging out and girl, HB7, (although for most of the year all girls seemed HBUNTOUCHABLE to me) begins flashing me some *dangereux* eyes and other IOIs.Our whole seminar class goes to our Professor's last week for an end-of-the-year dinner. As soon as I saw her that night, I felt like I could've just picked her up and lifted her to my house I was so confident in taking her home. Great night, few bars later, bus trips, meal, etc., she's in my room begging to me fuck. PROBLEM? Yah, no condoms. Really. No condoms (until the next day I remember I have condoms in my bathroom. Yah. Vodka).So anyway this girl is really cute about it and we laugh about it ("Fuck it," I say, "let's have this baby, baby") but then it gets serious, as it will, and obviously we really want to fuck. So we do for like 5min before I remember other terrible situations this has lead to and wisely pull out and stop. We fool around, fall asleep, wake up and oral again. I can tell this girl is really attracted to me, seems to be way more into me than I'm into her.I really wake up (after she's left), more sober, and realize how stupid I've been. I really start worrying (even though I didn't come close to cumming in her) because my ex had a surprise unwanted pregnancy (--&gt; abortion) before and the first reddit link I saw that day had "pregnancy" in the title. So I figure I have to man up and at least talk to this girl about the reality of the situation. I call her up and let her know if she wants I'll pay for a morning after pill, let her know the reality of the situation, but she thinks it's fine, just finished her period a couple of days ago, I say ok, go to a pharmacist and talk about it and the pharmacist agrees it should be fine. Girl seems really glad I've done this and we joke ("I can't believe you talked to a pharmacist about my period!!" I reply, 'I can't believe I talked to the McDonald's employee about your period. But Chet thinks we're fine too') and keep things light over phone/text. Not ideal, obviously, to talk/text her just the same day but this is a real life situation. Anyway, everything seems ok and we say our goodbyes.BUT! she's left her earring at my place; and I still have a penis; and so a few days later I'm really thinking about getting this done right and fucking her for real. I'm thinking the previous situation automatically cancels out any future fuck and that's probably for the best, but I don't want to regret trying so I text something like,&gt; "Hmm...I can't seem to find this earring....I'll need your help after you come out after drinks with me.."She replies, "so that's the price I have to pay to get my earring back, huh?" I reply, "I don't recall mentioning a price, but if you want to pay me, too, that's fine.." and we leave it at that. I call her today to set something up for Monday (I wasn't sure about her tone in the text) and she gives me some money/schoolwork excuse. I told myself not to be surprised with a negative response, but I felt like we got through it easily and she was really attracted to me.So I'm pretty sure it is what it is and it's time to move on (I have another date next week anyway) but I really want to f-close this girl the right way. Much rather that than having to return her earring. So, seddit, is it impossible to recover from this? Or does the "what kind of man doesn't have condoms"ness of the situation disqualify any future fuck? I've had a long dry spell and really just would love to fool around with this girl casually..**TL;DR: Fucked girl without protection, didn't come close to cumming, worried about it, called her next day to see if she was worried, talked about it, figured it's fine. Now have condoms, want to fuck her properly.**
hnd2q	-55532	1306743673	seduction	[FR] Going out with a pie of cute met online	Hey folks, Well here goes. I haven’t much been a proponent for online dating but a friend gets mixed results with PlentyOfFish so I decided it’d be fun to meet girls whilst wearing sweatpants in the comfort of my room. I joined last Monday, made a wacky profile (I’m the sort of guy that rarely takes anything seriously – much to my detriment) and started mass messaging girls. Usually something quick and witty, written in caps because I feel like caps represents characteristics I wish to develop (yes, seriously!). For example, it’s a faux pas to type in caps, so to type in caps means you just don’t give a fuck (it’s good practice), you’re going against social conditioning, being “BIG” or alpha and standing out from the rest of the polite proper texted dudes. All things I want to take into actual life. I want to be CAPITAL.I got a fairly decent response rate and one girl I think is really cute sent a really flirty reply. We message back and forth, she suggests we text before I do, we do, I call her, set up plans. She’s an HB7 online.. I wanted to see a band I like (asked if she liked to dance she said yeah) and check out a bar I like for some drinks first. We meet and I’m immediately shocked at how much better she looks in person. This girl is a serious HB8 (for me: nice petite artsy girl, dangerously cute) but carries herself with this really strong sexy HB10 attitude (really well dressed, knows what she wants from life etc.) so I’m a bit intimidated. I give her a hug and notice she’s not one of those hug right away people because she’s sort of “Oh, we’re doing this,” about it. Minutes after we go to the bar…Upon arriving, a pretty good friend of mine I didn’t expect to be there stands up, shouts my name and invites us over (keep in mind this is like within 2minutes of knowing this girl). So what I planned as a good chance to get to know this girl before we head out turns into this weird hybrid social grouping 3 guys 2 girls. My friend somehow immediately spills wine all over this girl and she’s shy and doesn’t seem to know how to handle the whole situation. I’m pretty comfortable but I feel awkward for her. Guys, this is a problem for me: I’m so worried about how the other person is, because I’m pretty resilient and know I’m usually pretty ok. So I’ll overask and overmonitor..I need to not worry about how much fun another adult is having.The awkward energy dissipates eventually and things ease in…we get some drinks, my buddy tends to lead exchanges because he’s a bit of a self-indulgent actor and I don’t really try to fight his will to talk. I’m a pretty witty guy and get my stuff in and talk to HB8 enough but it’s still a bit weird but she’s loosened up. I decide we should bounce to the show. I pay my bill and I think the girl assumes I’ve bought her drink as well. I tell her “Yeah, I didn’t get yours, by the way,” and sort of laugh about it to myself but secretly feel like the man. We get to the show and whoa, very few people have shown up to this band that USUALLY draws a very good, devoted crowd. Very strange vibe in the whole place, really big venue but no one in it. Fuck fuck fuck. Girl admits she’s not really into dancing. I haven’t been to the bar before and she tells me it’s usually always shit. Oh well. I try to focus on just having a good time but the girl is checking her phone and not really dancing, I’m so uncomfortable for her that I ask her if she’d rather leave and go walk around. (I KNOW THIS IS SOME REALLY LAME SHIT BUT I COULDN’T HELP AGAINST IT! Any recommendations?) She assures me she’s fine and even tries to make me feel comfortable about how obviously uncomfortable she is by pushing us closer to the front…even though she still didn’t really dance. I guess I have to accept that some girls don’t really dance, let alone in this strange vibed place. Probably just the vibe and if I was good I could get past it. I’m a pretty good dancer so I felt weird. Which brings me to this…I have no physical game. I can talk a girl’s ear off and make her laugh laugh laugh. Seriously I’m wayyyy overcalibrated in this area – I’m a comedian and often feel like I have an audience instead of a girl next to me. I have mad verbal wit game (too much joking, not enough serious), but no comfort with escalating with a girl. I always feel like it’s improper to try and grab her hand when I don’t know her well or touch her back etc. It’s so bad girls will grab my hand and start prompting me to physically escalate. It’s so bad I find out later on that so and so had a crush on me but thought I wasn’t into her at all, etc. I’m a pretty cute guy but I guess it’s my social conditioning (I have a sister who’s really equality this etc., respect women all that) – I assume it’s wrong to touch women. This is easily, easily, easily the weakest part of my largely non-existent game. Anyways, finally the band finishes and we leave. The one good thing about the show was that between songs she was talking in a way that said she was still interested and understood the comedic situation we were in. Even the band (used to better shows for sure) joked about it. So we leave and just start walking around the city. Because the way the night went I didn’t really get to know her so we talked and walked for about 1h30min. It was a pretty solid conversation and I could feel her interest strongly but even more strongly her curiousity about my complete lack of physical interaction. I have a nice body and I’m attractive but I just can’t get past going for it. I even listen to slow jams and straight fucking tunes before I go out to pump up but I just feel like I’ll be being a creep if I touch a girl. I don't have the INNER GAME/confidence that I can and should do this...So we make it back to her apartment outside and she’s just waiting to get kissed, which I expected but was still surprised by because a lot had gone wrong. Probably only kissed around 10 seconds because it was the first we had really touched….wasn’t much sexual tension or explosive sexual energy, I feel like that’s entirely my fault. It wasn't a frame of mad-crazy make out, more like "we just talked about life and the universe for awhile." When I pulled back and looked into her eyes I knew I would be coming back for more because lord lord lord LORD this girl is cute. I think I might just need to check her out more and get a boner and then use it. I said we’ll have to do this again sometime and she replied, “call me when you want to” or something like that. She’s really forward with the texts and has mentioned she doesn’t meet many guys so it’s sort of on but I question if I’m what she wants or what she needs. Asked me to text her when I got home to “make sure I didn’t get abducted.” Anyway, I feel like physical escalation is a really big problem for me I want to work on. It’s like I have to have some strange permission before I feel like I can just go caveman. So all in all a great night: I kissed a girl and exposed some areas to work on. Definitely need to do some logistic work before any outing, plan better….but mainly escalate. How do I become comfortable with being more touchy? I really wanted more than a k-close but that’s still something. I feel like I trick myself into thinking, “She’s one of those quality slow girls you have to take it slow,” but that’s just a mask for my inability to really get in touch with my sexual desire for a girl. It's 50/50 on whether or not she'll flake next time I call her, but I'm confident we'll go out again. TL;DR: Met a cute girl from online, don't know how to feel comfortable with physically escalating (little things like hand holds, etc.), managed a little k-close makeout and developed connection.
hqxay	-55532	1307121601	seduction	[FR] 2ND MEET W/ PIE OF CUTE, GLORY F-CLOSE 	Hiya sedd. I made a lil' FR about this girl before. We went out and I didn't escalate things well enough but she was definitely buying. Anyways I made some casual plans to go out after work last night, around 11:30pm. I said I wanted to go to the park and walk around and she agreed. Bought a bottle of wine, book bagged it old school style, snuck into the park, spread a blanket on the ruins of a battery built in the 18th century and went about what we went there to go about. At one point security drove by with flashlights but didn't see us and that just made it so much better. Girl is one of those girls that cums really quick and often so today I have been moonwalking instead of my usual tread. Walked her home, invited myself in and banged her obnoxiously loud again while her roommates "slept."Escalated by pretending I was cold, incidental contact, play wrestling, the stop kiss, sexual convo.Sorry for the poor write up, out the door quick today.EDIT: I’ll elaborate because I had to write the glory out earlier and I didn’t include any helpful details. And that makes me seem a bit vain rather than someone who wants to teach himself and maybe even others. I’ll focus on things I actively tried to do to escalate things physically, because I have very good verbal game but don’t balance things out physically. This could lead to friendzoning; so it inspires me to really work at the physical escalation ideas because I already have friends that are girls, and I’d rather not be sexually attracted to them. The way I see it, I have to be physical right away. The longer you go without being physical, the harder it is to cross the barrier you’re establishing. So I decided I have to establish touch right away – whether it be by a hug, spin, high five. I met the girl at her place last night and invited myself in “to use the washroom” but really to get us familiar with my presence there. I did a little vulnerable man thing by saying, “Ah, it’s really cold out there, I think I need a hug for warmth.” Then I held the hug and made her wait until I was warm. "Yeah, still a little cold. It's not my problem; your core temperature could use some work" etc. If you’re funny, I’ve learned, you can get away with a lot. On the walk there I made sure to use the “push-pull” technique by shoulder brushing her whenever I said something teasing her. Eventually she started doing it to me. At one point I faked I had a rock in my shoe so I could balance against her and really hammed up how “off-balance” I was by leaning into her etc. She knows you’re joking and just want to touch her and that’s even more attractive because you’re showing your wit and sexual drive. I’m rarely serious and established a pretty playful vibe so sometimes she’d say something that sounded like a disqualifier and I’d pretend to leave or run away from her. She mentioned not many people call her and I had some fun with that. I also do this thing where I ask, "Do you think it's a universal trait that people know when someone else is looking at them?" This opens the frame of me continually looking at her while we're walking. It's funny, but sexually charged. It builds your confidence. It also field tests the question - you're getting away with being "creepy" by proving a point you asked about.Eventually we get to the park and I’ve pretty much decided if a girl you don’t know well decides to go to a park with you after hours, obviously it’s on, so I’m pretty confident now. I say my hand is cold so I grab hers. Then I say her butt is cold and slap it really hard. Because it’s funny, it works. The “Stop Kiss” is a little thing I do that I’m pretty sure girls like. I think women really like it when they think you're so attracted to them it overwhelms you. I had an ex-girlfriend who had a “rape fantasy” and she explained it using the same logic – she loved the idea of a man not being able to control his desire for her. So I took that at root and applied it to something simple: when walking with a girl, mid conversation, maybe after she says something funny or particularly becoming, I stop walking, turn her to me, say, “Come here” and pull her in for a kiss. I really indulge in it and touch her neck, usually close by saying, “mmm, that was nice,” in really hush tones. Then you proceed as if nothing happened. It’s sort of an extreme push pull too because you’re saying, “Wow, I’m so attracted to you” but then you stop and walk on, really pushing her buttons, saying, “Yeah, I’m really attracted to you – but I will decide when I want to indulge myself.” I find this really builds tension and really turns the girl on. By the time we put the blanket down and opened the wine it was pretty much on. But it wouldn’t have been without the escalation, which I really planned on before going out. I had the realization this outing that girls aren’t intimidating at all – she has all these goals and aspirations and ambitions but deep down she wants a guy and has her own insecurities and confusion. I know how to navigate my own concerns and can handle my own problems so it made me feel really confident: she’s just a person like me, nah, probably even more vulnerable because she’s not leading. I was just so full of confidence and power in a weird way I felt like I possessed her, at least for the night. I also had this realization: attraction is an investment. It’s temporary, and time-dependent. You can’t take it for granted that someone likes you and coast on it. It’s always a dance, in a way always a performance. You’re always in the moment, as you always should be. I don’t want to be complacent in any way. Attraction or “game” is like the ultimate performance: you’ll have off nights and on nights. It’s never you if you’re rejected, it was your performance in that moment; if you’re the man one night, you performed well that night. This frame makes me much more excited about game because it makes it one of fun and excitement, rather than a set of predetermined characteristics etc. someone has to meet. You have to be in the moment! You HAVE to have fun. And what could be better than having to have fun?
jgegc	-55532	1313119650	seduction	[FR] Just need to write!	Well hey guys/girls, I haven't posted on here for so long, and rightly so as I've been involved with the girl I mentioned in a previous FR. Honestly, it's out of complacency more than anything (for the both of us); nothing soothes like uncomplicated sex. I'm here to relate a few things and ask some others. I really want to say how seddit, despite all of its warts, has changed me this summer. I have always felt I'm a naturally positive, ebullient guy who goes after what he wants and can get it, but often I need vicarious validation: reading all the FRs, especially the failures, has affirmed that its good work to strike against fear to become the person you know you are. (I'm quite tired and yes, acknowledge the lamentable state of my language at the moment). So, although I haven't gone "sargeing" (I don't like clubs, etc.) I've been talking to more people than I ever used to (not everyone, yet), making eye contact with girls I wouldn't have before, and seem to be considering the potential in people I would otherwise have stereotyped because of my own insecurities. All good stuff. Really it's surprising how simple it is to change your life in a big way. Smiling, eye contact, AND the most important thing: being yourself CONFIDENTLY. I know now what people love most about me: when I'm ME. just do what I want to do without considering how it might look. I say what I want to say, wear what I want to wear; in general i'm trying to be as comfortable as I can be, to put myself in the best place where I can be my natural self (I think it's society that's taught me my poor ways with women; when I'm 100% in the moment, just myself, I'm fine). It's been so freeing! Often I don't even look in mirrors just because I know more often than not I'll criticize something, become self-conscious about something, and be in a worse mood because of it! And people won't care about the fleck of dry skin they won't notice! I'm having regular, uncomplicated sex, and don't feel needy or scared of it ending because I'm meeting so many new people and I know I can go out and meet new women easily. Wow!At a festival a few weeks back, I met a girl I thought/maybe think is a dreamgirl. Really hippie girl, musician, like watching the sun part the clouds it is to see her smile. Anyway, I've been hanging out with this girl but I've run into the familiar problem of being intimidated by a woman I'm genuinely attracted to as a person I might like to have a serious relationship with. "She's out of my league; I'm not cool enough for her; she knows everyone/meets everyone, probably dates the ghost of Jim Morrison." Predictably I have trouble initiating kino and establishing ANY sexual vibe whatsoever. Probably will be friendzoned but it's not really bothering me because I'm leaving where I'm living soon and the more I get to know this girl the less she really seems for me (or am I rejecting myself before I've been rejected?). I was out with her and some friends to a show (bands) last night, trying to track the mating rituals of a hippie girl (do you know this type of girl? she seems so pure and innocent and can say things like "Ah, I'm so wet" if she sits on a rain-covered surface and never consider the possible sexual interpretation) when a hippie looking guy (no shirt, beard, talking about hitch hiking, drinking freely in the street, so happy, wearing a cap) approached her and started talking to her. He didn't ONCE break eye contact or stop smiling; they both started giggling and already he was initiating light touch; he wasn't even saying anything REMOTELY interesting, just being genuine with his sexual interest. At one point he started to grunt like an ape and they mimicked monkeys together. This was EXACTLY what I needed to see. Across culture, within culture, attraction is probably the same thing. You see something you want and you act on your intent to take it. It's no different for a hipster or a hippy. You might think I was angry because this man clearly won her love immediately as I watched, but I just really needed to see that to understand IT'S NOT COMPLICATED, IT'S ALWAYS MORE SIMPLE THAN YOU THINK. What happens from here on? Well I dunno! I haven't had a case of unrequited love for awhile, and it's probably too late for me, but I'll make some sort of move soon, as I don't think I could be friends with this girl without being attracted to her. But I know this from the whole experience: I have trouble communicating my intent, for whatever reason (and the reason doesn't matter as much as knowledge of it does). When I don't communicate my intent around women I'm actually really attracted to, I become self-conscious because I KNOW I'm not expressing my true self. This creates tension, anxiety, and I'm out of the moment. Less creative, less fun, more self-conscious. So what do I have to do? Well, lucky for me, I have to start communicating my sexual intent and let it decide what happens, rather than waiting to be decided upon. I'm not "of less value" than an attractive woman, and it's ridiculous for me to be so incongruent around the woman I'm currently most attracted to: I have to be myself, and that means expressing all aspects of my personality. Act on intent! It's what people want!Time to get out of my head and have fun. Thanks for letting me expressing myself, folks. I'm certain there are many typos and inconsistencies, but that's how it is. 
k2umj	-55532	1314995774	100sets	[AndreiAndTheOaktree] Round #1: Conquer Your Fear and Approach	Hi all. I believe there's a natural within me somewhere waiting to be let out from the lid of fear keeping me in. I know I'm the right guy for a lot of people but I have trouble still convincing myself they won't mind if I interject into their lives. So here I am, challenging myself to become what I don't let myself BE on a regular basis. I got a FWB situation but if anything it's keeping me complacent and I'm not developing. I want to banish fear and welcome true expression of my personality.My goal is to make 100 approaches by October. This seems both easy and hard. If I don't get it done, I'd like at least 50. I'm not looking for any outcome beyond being friendly, having genuine interactions with people. I need my approaches to be accountable and knowing others are doing the same will no doubt be an inspiration to continue.So here I go, off to become a better man!Note: I'll refine the goal as I go on. It's still not as specific as I'd like. REFINE: I'd like for this to really challenge me, so the refinement is thus: approach strangers (complete strangers) in public. I'll count friends of friends but it's not ideal.

vmldn	-55532	1340716171	leaves	Three Weeks into Life Change	Hey, leaves. I didn't think I'd need to write here but, as with all things challenging, the difficult bit is consistency. I haven't smoked in three weeks and those three weeks were the easiest because it was something still leaving me whereas now I'm adjusting to life without weed and it's more difficult - all the benefits I got from weed I have to replace - and all the benefits from quitting I haven't fully realized I'm experiencing. I'm a stand up comedian, and getting high was my source of inspiration and what got me into that "zone" where I could flow without worry and rely on simply losing self-consciousness - I could slip into a safe place and talk and feel comfortable, not worrying about "making people laugh," just trusting in my talent and watching it flow from me. But I knew this was only a short-term solution because long-term, I saw myself forgetting things and becoming lazier and not doing as much as I thought I could. My biggest challenge now is making things fun again and becoming a social creature again without being too self-conscious. I haven't been writing, I haven't been having fun performing, even when I do well. This post is is the most I've written in three weeks, really - or at least the only concerted effort I've made at sitting down without reflecting and just writing. I'm starting a mindfulness meditation practice and go to the gym 6 days a week (weight training + physiotherapy). I suppose I should mention I was hit by a car (hit and run, no compensation) just after moving to London, UK and fractured a bone in my knee, tore two ligaments and had to have major surgery. This has been a bit hellish. I don't have a job because I saved for two years in Canada to move here and do this, and needless to say, didn't plan on getting hit by a car and have to recover from that so it's been challenging. A lot of the momentum and positive loop cycle I created in Canada has dissipated. Weed became a reward for being injured and my daily intake went way up - it helped with pain, and once I started performing again I came to rely even more heavily on it for having fun performances. But now that I've stopped, I have difficult staying in a positive mood - much more doubt, and my self-esteem I feel has dropped. I know what I have to do, get out and have fun, meet people, start talking to women, generate positive emotions and build the positive loop cycle up again, but I'm finding it difficult just to DO IT. Weed really helped me NOT THINK and just HAVE FUN. I think I'm just missing a social circle and I'm in a more challenging situation than I've been in for awhile (moving for a dream, no job, recovering from serious major surgery, just quit marijuana, feeling like a "victim" and the subsequent effects on the ego), so it's understandable, but I'm just beginning to understand the life change is the biggest challenge. Quitting is easy. Going through withdrawal wasn't bad. The worst part is learning how to do things in a way to make them as fun as when you were high. It shouldn't be easy; that's why we get high, it's so easy and the sober answer is hard. So I guess I'm asking: What do you folks do instead? I find socializing and talking to strangers gives me the same rush but I'm much more self-conscious now and my self-esteem is much lower. I guess I just have to do it. Anyway looking for help from people that have successfully REPLACED weed with something else. I'm already really active and physical, but not social enough, I have to work on that. How do you make things fun again? Can you reach the same states of consciousness without drugs? Do you feel more self-conscious? Has anyone replaced weed with something else, like meditation, and had great results? Have you been more creative or less creative since quitting? I know I'm killing this part of me and it takes time; thank Humanity we have places like this to share and comfort each other because some days are hard and often you don't want to complain in person, but anonymously ;)
16hzyx	-55532	1358099939	leaves	Can you reach the same states sober?	Hey people. Well, I'm trying to quit weed again. I made it 3 months last time.Good months. But then I had a show in Copenhagen, and I know about Christiania, so I went there and bought a bunch of weed and got high and loved it and performed so well and I thought, "Why am I doing this? I'm so much better high." I'm a comedian and my desire to do comedy started with weed and I get a lot of confidence from it. I get in the zone. I can dependably get to that zone with weed. I take a few tokes, all my self-consciousness fades, and I'm naturally funny. Granted there are times I'm too high or just it's not my night, but it's a dependable crutch. And that's the problem, too. I feel like I need it to myself, I feel more "myself" (because I'm not thinking, I'm going 'below thought' as Eckhart Tolle would say) than when I'm sober. And yet it's not the best for me, because I don't like the idea of being dependent on something to be funny. If I'm always high, I'm not feeling my unfunniness sober and so I'm not making changes that might lead to that same space sober. Therein lies the dilemma: should I smoke weed, be funny, rely on it, work with it? Or should I quit weed and use negative inspiration to make me search for the same feelings sober by working through insecurities and things like that? I feel like ultimately there's more room for growth there, but weed is now and I know that state I'm looking for is only a toke away. So I don't really know what to do. Are there any artists here with the same problem? I mean, I love being sober. The best part about being sober is being sober; but the worst part about being sober is being sober. I love smoking weed, but I hate smoking weed because it makes me feel like I'm missing something I can only get through a drug. I tried to use it sparingly, to use it to inspire me to seek that same thing sober and only get a little high, but I just ended up being high 24/7. Like i was escaping reality because being high was such a better reality, even though I know long term it wouldn't be. I feel like it's different for me or artists, performers, because I'm seeking to do something not many people can relate to, perhaps. I want to be comfortable in front of any audience, feel like I can be vulnerable without fear. Weed does that for me. Sober, it's different. I don't feel nearly as funny. But that has to be somewhere, doesn't it? I meditate daily, an hour every morning, and I'm making social challenges for myself, going out taking to strangers etc., but the difference is remarkable. It's obviously more work to get there sober, if it's possible, but I find it very frustrating knowing I could be much funnier FOR EVERYONE, if I just got high. I feel this artistic responsibility to myself and others to be funny, therefore to be high. But that's not health. Has anyone dealt with this? Can you reach that same level of comfort? Taking the filter off thought and finding consciousness sober? Weed is so tempting to me because it opens me to my muse and yet I don't want to need something to do the work I love. This is very problematic for me. If anyone could help with advice, similar stories, things to read, it would help me alot. Because I'm currently two weeks without weed, and I feel GREAT. But I don't feel HIGH. I'm caught between two worlds: I want to be sober with a high, and when I'm high, I want it to be my sober state. Thanks for the read everyone, and good luck in your process as well. 
16xhlt	-55532	1358692509	whatstheword	WTW for someone that wants to have sex with their "self." Is there a word for this? Example inside. 	Here's an example, what I'm using it for. I just thought of it so it's clunky but I like the idea."I don't like the dumb surge of self-confidence I feel after a good haircut. I don't walk, I stroll, I loll in the sense of self-improvement, looking in as many reflective surfaces as possible, asking myself, 'Who's this guy? Who's this new man in town? I'd buy him a drink or two!'So in love with myself, I imagine myself as a woman attracted to me. So in love with myself, I imagine myself as a woman, while still being a man. So full of ego, I experience, not a metaphysical sex change, but the creation of a separate ego, the woman in me. I experience mitosis of the ego and the reification of the Jungian concept of the anima, the feminine part of a man's personality, just so I can sexually objectify my self and give birth to even more ego."So, what would this be? It's wanting to have sex with yourself...heterosexual sex but entirely within your "self." What would that desire be called? Does such a word exist?Thanks for the help! 
1gv81c	-55532	1371925893	Meditation	Question Regarding Counting Breath	Hi all, Here's a question: I've been meditating for longer periods of time now, recently working on an hour straight. I find it's a lot easier if I count my breath, what I'll do is when I really start to feel anxious or like I want to move or stop, I'll count 200 breaths, then backwards from 200. I'm wondering is perhaps this is counter-productive as the count is a sort of trick to keep focused on breathing, rather than working on breathing through "harder" thoughts of wanting to stop, etc. If I didn't count, just focused on air passing through nose through those hard thoughts, would I be making for better practice long run? It would be a lot harder, but probably make for better concentration as I wouldn't be relying on "tricks" to focus my mind. Should I just be breathing through the pain/discomfort and noticing it, holding it in awareness, or count through it so I don't feel it as much? If I don't count, the hour seems much longer and more difficult. However, it feels more rewarding. Please note I'm working on longer time meditating as I find the benefits of meditation, for me, seem to happen past the 20minute mark, when my thoughts fade a bit and I come more in tune with my body. I'm working through clinical depression right now, so I know things are more difficult and listening to the negative thinking is hard, but the long-term benefits are worth the short term pain. Thanks for your insight. love, dave

2fck77	-55532	1409744609	leaves	Crashing and Burning (17 days sober)	Heya folks. On this subreddit again, posting about quitting marijuana for the fourth, fifth...however many amount of times it's been. It's been like that, though. I'll make it a month or two - 10 weeks last time. And then something happens and I'm giving myself the business - "just one time, only today, maybe only on the weekends; it's important to have a shift in perspective - it's better for me sober to be high some of the time" - and a few months to a year go by in a haze. The only real consistency has been that pattern of abuse: an attempt at sobriety, and then more abuse after the attempt to stop. I've tried the moderation route, and it just hasn't worked. I guess I have to accept that I do have a problem - the problem not being marijuana itself, but whatever unresolved trauma is causing me to escape into the drug high. Sobriety gives me the chance to overcome those traumas; and that's precisely what's so challenging about it and why many of us end up "using" again (usually a term reserved for hard drug use, but it's important to recognize an addiction for an addiction and treat it with respect because it will wreak havoc in your life). It is very difficult to be sober and see with clarity how disappointed or maladjusted you are. Quitting a drug is probably like 1/8th of the process. Even to be writing this, even to be reading again, putting information together and building the patience and focus to do this takes a lot of energy and....uhh focus? that i lost through continually getting high or relying on MJ to allow me to "be creative." See, I envisioned this to be a sprawling...bildungsroman (took me awhile to remember that word; years ago it would've come quicker) epic about the role marijuana has played in my life....but already I'm glancing at the clock and feel like i don't want to be doing this. That's probably something to do with the way my brain has been shaped by incessant internet use as well. A lot of bad habits at once. I know I could get high and write something witty and dynamic; I could get high and feel like I'm "me" and impress you with my writing. But this is the real me. Sure, that creative, talented fucknut is in there somewhere. I've just got to actually work for it, rather than relying on a shortcut to get there. Short-term, that high is so tempting because it takes me to that transcendent creative place; long-term, i become reliant on an external thing to get something internal out. I become dependent on something that isn't me. So I've trained myself to be worse, long term. It just can't work that way. Anyway...i've been been 17 days sober now, and I'm not trying to pretend it will be forever. Just a day at a time. I feel a lot better. But I also feel a lot worse at times because my flaws are that much more apparent and demanding of my frayed attention. I can't keep smoking weed the way I was smoking. or else I will have to concede a lot of my aspirations and hopes to another life. Most recently (well, 18months ago) I was hit by a car in a foreign country, and as a result i have spent a lot of the time in and out of physiotherapy to help repair my knees and tendons. Marijuana became the way I dealt with the frustration of a hit and run accident...the helplessness and powerlessness of being a victim of a crime in a place where no one knows or cares.......now I see it was actually making me focus more on my pain and enabled a lot of victimization. (Ha, I wish I was high right now so I could properly explain myself, this feels like a sprawling mess). For so long i have been a mess physically and mentally, and looked to something external to solve that, rather than doing what's necessary: taking responsibility for my pain, whether I was the cause of it or not. That's just the reality of life and being an adult: bad shit happens. too bad. it happens to everyone, and you have to get yourself through it, because no one else really cares - even if they do, there's only so much they can do. Yeah, I'm in pain - what the fuck, I'm still alive. A drug addiction isn't going to help with any of it. Getting sober should help me go through the next necessary steps to getting healthy. I guess this just felt necessary - i have to start writing and looking at my self, as opposed to just avoiding it (like I was with getting high). it's also important to not care whether or not something is "good" - what matters more is building back old habits. Like a mental gym, i suppose. thanks again to this subreddit, it really does help to have people to talk to because we all can feel so alone in our struggles. I definitely have been very emotional and irritable since stopping. And that's with constant gym/yoga/meditation. On paper I'm doing everything right, but i think it's important to remember that it will just suck for awhile too, and that's the consequence of doing something to your brain for such a long time. you can feel your brain rebuilding itself. question: anyone have information about how long it takes your brain to rebuild whatever receptors or shit that's going on with marijuana in the brain? like the neuroscience behind it...i hear some people saying 28 days, some others 6 months. When can I expect my brain to be "rebooted"?thanks for reading, goddam! can't believe i wrote for 25min straight
321058	-55532	1428604487	leaves	10 Weeks Today	Salutations fellow leavers. I write today with a great big juicy boner for life. Or do I? No. Nor do I have an actual erection. Wow, not the best start. I don't have an erection. I'm writing with my fingers, people. Well, I didn't think I'd be this silly, but here we are. Rather, here I am. Without a boner. Let me stress that. I don't really know what I'm trying to accomplish here - so far I've just denied having an erection to the point where you're probably assuming I do have one. But enough about my not erection. I haven't smoked weed for 10 weeks, the longest I've gone without in probably 8 years. I say probably because my memory is rather shot. I'm not even sure if I mentioned not having an erection yet. But is is improving. (I have). I guess the idea is I get some glimpse of my progress and others like me see that and feel the strength to go on. I have not yet regained all my powers of writing. the last few weeks were by far the most challenging. There's definitely some underlying depression I was escaping from. Meditation does help let you see where you thoughts are, but sometimes it can make things worse because you become acutely aware of how furious or irritable you are. If you don't do something with those emotions, they'll do something with you. I would say I have been surprised by my own casual rage. It's like life is perpetually an old woman walking slow in front of me. And I know I shouldn't want to strangle her, but my whole body is telling me to. I also know it's my responsibility to deal with that emotion. I have been looking to external things to solve these issues, but really, like a good friend told me, you've got to take care of those, because no one else can or will. And no one else really cares. I've also surfed a rogue wave of indifference. Days off are the worst. There were a few weeks I did nought but stay in my room/house/bed and listen to the awful thoughts. Envy, jealously, resentment, anger. At times afraid to interact with people for fear of my own rage. And despite the strength of these emotions, how difficult it can be to work out. I am in very good shape, like an athlete, have been so for years, and yet the past few weeks the depression has made it VERY difficult to work out. Sometimes I'd just haphazardly attempt to "switch on" my body with the workout and get out of my head, but i'll leave, unable to do so. Oh well. Still went and tried. The past week has been much better. I think it's because I realized no one else will do this for me, and I have to at least try. For some reason no weed made me angry with everyone else but myself. And yet it was my constant decision. I put myself here. That's helped me be more accepting of the situation. A big part of the anger is being angry at not being in better moods. That makes it difficult to accept the anger, which is the only way out of it. Going, "Ok, I'm furious. What can we do with this?" I am lucky to really be into dancing, and so once or twice a week I'll go dance to EDM for 4 hours and sweat it all out. I have a few girls I see once or twice a week. I eat well, meditate, and workout. Have hobbies. Good parents. But still, MY FUCK, THIS IS CHALLENGING. This is probably the 8th time in the past few years I've tried to stop smoking weed. It's the furthest I've made it. I wouldn't have been able to do it had I not been given the confidence from NoFap. I stopped Fapping November 1st because I wanted to meet more women. Somehow it worked, and that gave me the confidence to trust my past self in determining my present and future. I'm starting to see the benefits of not smoking weed - I have been reading so much, and I just feel better in general. I'm also aware of how many words I lost from smoking, or memories of times out with good friends. I'm also aware of how dumb a lot of my friends are when they're high, and how they're smoking away their futures. Not that I'm totally against weed...obviously, it's AMAZING. But this sobriety is a worthy challenge. Sorry this is such a clusterfuck of randomness but I'm just regaining my writing work ethic and part of it is just accepting I kinda suck and am relearning a lot of things right now, and that's fun. [This might apply for those struggling with depression.](https://soundcloud.com/fartsmellrr86/milk)I'm a creative person/thing/wannabe, and losing my "creativity" has been the hardest thing/what always makes me go back. But I seem pretty at peace with accepting I never learned how to really do it sober, and that's more long lasting than the shortcut of weed. It seems like a shortcut, but you're fucking your brain long term. So i'm having fun with building my work ethic back and using all the rage and fury for good workouts/sex/dancing. I guess I wanted to say, Don't think this is over after the first month! This is a Change Your Lifestyle thing. You really have to become someone else, if you've been abusing weed for a long time. So if you're where I am and you're still struggling, then THAT'S NORMAL FOR ME SO DON'T FEEL WEIRD. thanks/sorry.
353omi	-55532	1430946134	leaves	14 WEEKS X 7 DAYS = 98 DAYS = PRETTY MUCH 100 DAYS WITHOUT MARY J. UANA	Dear Leavers, I write with fingers greased by the stomach linings of my vanquished foe, Marijuana. For years I lay crushed beneath her sleeping weight, a weight I did not understand, for both it and I were asleep. It was a time as confusing and mixed as my metaphors. But one day I woke up and said, "I am tired of my lips being crumbly, my eyes being sore, and my memory being as short term as the relationships I have with cashiers." I think it went something like that, anyway. It has been 14 weeks since I last smoked marijuana, and I can now say, pusillanimous, verisimilitude, transmogrify, and various other words I thought had vanished forever from my vocabulary. It is indeed a strange fixture of your brain returning to retrieve words from somewhere long lost. to of a sudden know what recalcitrant means after years of a brain so long obsessed with being so. I slew that Beast named Mary with long, terrible days of anxiety and doubt. For 12 weeks I thought nothing was possible. certainly nothing creative could be accomplished. But I knew my willpower would be needed, so I didn't really stress about that. The only reason I continued to smoke for so long (10 years chronic) was because it helped me be "creative." Or, I thought I needed it to be creative. But I knew, at the same time, it was like using steroids at the gym. Somewhere my balls were shrinking. What seemed beneficial short term was really creating long term. The theory went, Eventually, with abstinence, the long term benefits of not smoking weed would outweight the short term pleasure of being high. Around week 13 I had enough willpower to just start doing things without worrying. "It doesn't have to be good, it just has to be something" is the motto. I am starting to make things again, albeit perhaps with less enthusiasm and in a slower way. However, that's the legacy of weed, and it's not because I don't "enjoy" being creative. It's because I've trained my brain to think it needs weed. The first sign of progress is proof greater progress can be made and so I buy in more and more to myself when I do something small. I am building bigger and bigger things. For me, this has so much to do with becoming more intelligent in your psychology. It has been very beneficial, but also very trying, and very depressing at times. However, those low points are proof that your brain is healing, going through necessary things, and letting you get to that next place. You want to give in at the more stressful times, but they're the times that prove more than any to yourself that what you're doing is actually getting you somewhere. That's the paradox. You must interpret the stress as positive evidence, and not something to escape. Once you have that perspective, it's much easier to avoid getting high to escape the pain. You just say, Ah, the pain is proof. And something about proof being pudding and pudding is nice, so no weed for me thank you. I have found this place to be very helpful. Just knowing there's other creatives and weirdos or just people not wanting to get high anymore helps me not get high. I feel now like I am not "a stoner" anymore, and I much more identify with the benefits of sobriety. It is very nice. Here is something I made about addiction. An analogy about abusing any substance. Because if we did anything with as much intensity and consistency as we smoked weed, people would be concerned...[Oatmeal Dave](https://soundcloud.com/fartsmellrr86/oatmeal-dave)Maybe that will help. It has helped me. So, for anyone struggling with being creative without weed, just know, it does get better, but you have to work for it to get there. I spend so much time now just forcing myself to write, or get into characters, or do stand up, or record. I just say, Give it 25minutes. Find some Positive Addictions. Become addicted to your processes, and not your outcomes. Because eventually you will produce something. But it's a matter of letting your filter down, and acknowledging, yeah, you probably kinda do suck right now. But somewhere within you are the same thoughts and capabilities you had when high, only now you can find them with the focus and clarity of a sober mind. Keep going, you fucklickers. Fat off the ruptured spleen of my enemies, fartsmellrr86.

I played all the major JRPGs in last 20 years and all the major WRPGs and this game Skyrim is by far the best, its a game changer. I have already played it none stop for 3 days(42 hours on gaming in 3 days).Before you bitch at me to downloading it I have the collectors edition on pre-order and fully paid off. So I couldn't help my self but download it.edit: I'm not sharing anything else because that will spoil it for you. The game is utter badassness.edit: one thing I will say that boss level scaling is brutal. Worse for melee vs casters boss.

I was eating at the local dining hall with a few guys and this kid we were with decided to try out his new stupid pick up line. He walked up to some random girl and said, "so I heard you like pizza... and sex" (okay so I will be the first to say that he is an idiot, but keep reading). She gave him a look of disgust and went to sit down at her table. We were sitting a few tables away and he decided to throw her a couple winks just to continue his attempt to be funny. She waved over the local security guard to tell him probably to get that stupid kid to stop. 2 days later Billy's scholarship is gone, he has been charged with sexual harassment, and he is on his way out the door. So okay, this kid is an idiot and I don't know why he would say that in public but to get kicked out of school for sexual harassment? Maybe that's just me but I think some people need to chill out or redefine sexual harassment if minor disturbances are ruining people's life plans. So reddit, I know there are better stories out there, do your thing...
kzaw5	-55561	1317646362	reddit.com	My ex-girlfriend is a porn star	I met this girl last semester in college. She was the most beautiful person I had ever met, somehow we got to know each other through a friend and long story short she loved me. We were together all that semester and kept in really good touch over the summer. She lived far away but we saw each other all we could a skyped every day. Everything about her seemed perfect, similar views on everything that mattered, same underground house music taste (rarity in girls where I'm from, huge turn on) willing to go out and do anything, and one of the best things brutally honest about everything. I liked this quality because she wasn't afraid to hurt someones feelings, she told it like it was. This took out all drama, any awkward conversations and everything and best of all it allowed me to trust her completely. One of the greatest things about her was she liked sex more than I did and she had an ass that would make J-Lo double-take. With as beautiful as she was this was almost a turn off because I would just have assumed she was a mega whore. But she claimed she had only had sex with 2 guys and just lost her virginity a year before me. It didn't take her long to convince me this was true (I still believe it is). She was very responsible with her sex life. She could have sex with any guy but she has morals and standards and wouldn't cheat if her life depended on it. So like I said everything was going great. The problem was she was not motivated for school, she wasn't dumb but she just wouldn't do homework. She came to my room all the time instead of studying and even though I would try to force her to leave so she could concentrate she would just get back and text me. So she failed a couple classes and got her scholarship taken away. This scholarship was the only thing keeping her here financially because her parents couldn't pay for anything so she had to make a decision: pull out another loan or move to California to live with her near her family. Her mom wouldn't co-sign the loan because she didn't want her to go to college in the first place (needless to say I am not a huge fan of her mom). She could have gotten another family member to co-sign most likely but at this point I told her it was probably a good idea to get a job near her fam and get money to go to a community college. Neither of us were happy but given the many circumstances it was the right thing to do I think. She decided to go live with her friend in Cali who is doing decent in her own apartment working full time at a hotel as a manager or something so I was convinced it was a cool idea, I knew it was going to be a struggle for her but I had faith in her. Our last day together was tough. I took her to a fancy dinner and blah blah there were many tears (from her of course, I'm a man I don't cry). We talked about maybe getting together again sometime but not really expecting it. Then she left. It was hard but it was for the best. We talked on the phone a lot the next couple days and after a couple weeks it slowly started being an occasional text. Then she stopped responding to some of my texts. I did think much of it. I'm not an emotional guy, I was moving on to some extent, I'm an engineer, I got a lot of work to do but I still thought about her and wondered if she didn't answer because of another guy. I know that sounds gay but I wasn't stressed or anything. Last night I got a text from her asking me how I was and how she misses me and wishes we could hang out. It was nice and we had a short talk when she said "I have to tell you something, and you're probably not going to like it". Here it is, I was expecting her to say I found another guy and ask if I was going to be okay. I was prepared, at least I won't have to worry about still liking her as much, I could be happy... "I'm a porn star". What. The. Fuck. "For how long?" I said. "Two weeks". I was speechless. What the hell do I say to that? I knew she was having trouble finding a good paying job but porn? I love me some porn but c'mon. Apparently a lot of the people she met over there were all convincing her to do it and it was easy money. She getting thousands of dollars a week. She asked me if I was disgusted with her and I didn't really have an answer. I'm not mad at her just confused. She was not a slut except maybe to me. She was my girl. One of my favorite qualities was her self control when it came to sex. I guarantee that when she was with me, Brad Pitt could have come up to her and asked her out and she would say hell no. Now I know she's not mine anymore but her last text to me last night was "I still love you, I'm your girl, and I want to be with you again someday". As honest as she is I can't help but think it's bull, maybe it's not and it just weird for me. She said she's only doing it until she can pay for school. I just don't really know how to take the situation. I'm more shocked than anything. Is it my fault for letting her go? Is it a bad thing for her to be doing porn? Do I want to see her videos? If I do have the chance to be with her again could I? Anyway, I know this isn't a big deal but I'm embarrassed to tell any of my friends so I decided to come to reddit. I don't know if I'm looking for advice or just needed to vent. It's only been a day, I'll be fine. Thanks for reading.

I feel like that is probably the best because it will reduce the chance of germ spread, unless you're having an orgy later or something. And don't say handkerchief because I'm not going to carry one around anyway.

1fh5ek	-55561	1370112386	NoFap	ED is out the door	I found NoFap because of the TED talk. I thought it was a very interesting concept that I had never thought about before. I guess I always thought I was addicted but who cares if your addicted to something that is not bad? BUT then I thought about it, and I have always had minor ED problems. Most of the time I can get UP but even when I do it takes me a long time to finish (good for her but sucks for me). And many times I don't even finish (I didn't when I lost my virginity). I had always blamed it on not finding the right girl for me but I always thought it was a little weird that most times I had sex I would rather have been watching porn (one time, half way through sex, I lied to say I had to go to the bathroom but instead I went to the other room, pulled up my computer, and re-energized, if you know what I mean LOL). Anyway, after doing a little surfing on NoFap I decided that porn could be the reason. Now, I never was more than a few times a week kinda guy but I did start early in my life so that could have much to do with it. So I decided when I got home from college I would do it. And I decided to start P90X as well; sort of create a little 90 day goal for working out and NoFapping aka testosterone explosion. It started out motivating and I had no problems for the first few days. Then day 4 hit... Day 4 was hard, I was looking for videos and reading through posts on NoFap to keep me from giving in. I was really close to just saying fuck it, the worst part about starting in the summer is the BORDOM. Now I have just worked out and I'm sitting surfing reddit and I have nothing to do all day except beg for an NSFW post to come up on the front page just to get a taste or think about opening an incognito tab. But I never did. After day 4 it is still tough but I think I'm doing very well now. The toughness of the challenge is exciting.Now for the reasoning for my title. I am only about two weeks in but I had sex yesterday for the first time since starting NoFap... And it was the BEST sex I have ever had! It was unreal, I was up faster than Michael Jackson at a playground, and harder than trigonometry. The best part was normally she GOES way before I do but after only a few minutes I realized I now had the control to GO when I wanted to, so right as she was peaking so did I. It was a new experience all togetherSo far I have not noticed any other significant effects but it has only been 12 days so considering that I've already seen improvements in the thing that I started for, I'm in for the long haul my friends.
1h0671	-55561	1372119200	NoFap	Blow Jobs are awesome!	So yesterday was day 34 and I discovered something really awesome. I love blow jobs! Now, I have had many a' blow job in my day but I had never busted from one. Long story short, I have always had my share of minor ED problems before I discovered NoFap (as I detailed in my first post on NoFap), I love sex but I never understood the appeal to blow jobs. I never disliked them but I only used them for foreplay and extra lubrication. I had always heard people say blow jobs were sometimes better than sex and I never got it. I've even had some awesome blow jobs, that I won't go in to detail about, so it definitely wasn't the female skill factor. But since I quit the dirty deed 35 days ago, I wanted to test the new waters and see how well this new lifestyle works. The girl I've been with recently knows of my journey and helped me out accordingly. And DAAAAAMN!....let's just say I brought out my "O" face.

1icw56	-55561	1373915023	NoFap	How do you think a Fapstronaut's should react?	I have read a few posts where people have said things like "After 100 days, I watched a whole porn and didn't even pop a boner". Now my thought is, porn should always turn you on but you should be man enough to not give in to the temptation. I tried watching some the other day just to see my reaction, and I will say that it was very 'hard' to not cave. But maybe I am wrong and that when someone truly wins NoFap they shall not phased. Any thoughts?

1mip8z	-55561	1379358344	NoFap	119 day update, tough days ahead	I have now made it almost 120 days and I thought things would be getting easier but it is not. It has always been hard for me but never as hard as it has for the last couple weeks. After day 100 I thought it would be, "you made it this far, may as well keep going". But instead it has been, "why are you still doing this?". I try to come to r/nofap for motivation but it's not helping like it used to (nothing against anyone here, you guys are great). The weirdest part is everything in my life is going great. I am finishing my last semester in college and I'm only enrolled in a few classes so I have plenty of time to go out and enjoy my life and I am. I guess the main problem I have is boredom. I am used to being busy every second of everyday but this semester is maybe a little too relaxed for me. (random note: I really am used to being busy all the time and the only thing that normally stresses me out is not being busy, so maybe my lack of things to do is causing stress which is wanting me to resort to PMO)       But no matter how much I try to tell myself this is good for the long run, the only thing that is keeping me going is the 119 badge I have today. I don't want everything to go to waste. Although, my mind is doing very well to convince me that it was never for waste, I learned a lot, and should just apply it at a more applicable time in my life.Anyway, as of now I am still okay and I hope I can keep it going but sometimes I feel each day is getting harder. One thing I heard Stevo say in his documentary 'Demise and Rise' after being sober for a couple years, "I'm not cured, I could start again anytime, but for now I'm fine". When I heard that I didn't understand why he would feel that way. If you have been sober for so long how is it still hard? Now I get it.      I hope this wasn't too discouraging, everything else is going well. I will say that I do have a better motivation to talk to girls because I know I have to work for the good feeling instead of just get it when ever (and this has definitely worked). I really don't care too much if anyone reads this, I just felt like I needed to write about my experience.

She has been a perfect girlfriend to me since we met. I met her last July and we moved in together by November. I rationalized this because I was deployed in February to Kuwait. I didn't want to stay with her through deployment at first but we fell in love and we both decided we wanted to stay together. Her love for me has grown exponentially and I know that she still does but leading up to deployment she was already starting to show signs of fear of me leaving. Not that she would ever be unfaithful but she really didn't want me to leave. After I left she would text me non stop and always call me and I could tell she was suffering from a mild form of depression. One day she brought up to me that we needed to have her see someone, I told her that we would look into it but we never did (looking back on it I should have been more proactive). But she assured me she could take care of herself. All of a sudden she started hanging out with new ppl and going down town almost 7 days a week. I didn't say anything off the bat but I just trusted that she found some good friends that were helping her cope. But her texting me slowed a lot. We used to skype every single day but now we do like once a week. When she did talk to me she was still genuine but I sensed something was different. Then last week I got a call from one of her friends saying that she has been cheating on me with 2 different people. I didn't say anything until I got more information but it turns out she has turned into a severe alcoholic and has been doing harder drugs too. This all hit me out of no where but I had a couple people confirm it. I don't have picture evidence but 2 of her friends assured me and I know for a fact she spends the night out at their houses very often. It is hard to describe everything about the situation but basically I'm going to confront her. If she can't handle me being away than she is the wrong person. But I don't know how to confront her. I was thinking over skype and slowly lead into all of the things I disagree with and then mention that "i have reason to believe that you are cheating on me", Then depending on the situation, end our relationship. I love this girl but I'm emotionally strong enough to gt over it. Although, I know she loves me like no other and I think this phase has been blown out of proportion because her stress and depression was worse than I thought. So part of me feels like I shouldn't just ditch her. If she's into hard drugs and I break up with her then she might get worse and kill herself (accidentally or intentionally). I wish I knew how she would react but all of this is too crazy for me to really comprehend. Her friends don't want to be around her anymore. What should I do? 
3aprbk	-55561	1434984171	relationship_advice	Help me Solve my Cheating mystery	BACKGROUND: So I have been dating this girl since last July, we hit it off great and we moved in together. It was an easy decision because I feel like she was trust worthy and I was getting deployed in February so I could leave my stuff with her (I would not have done this if I didn't feel like this girl loved me completely and was trust worthy). I am now deployed and she has been taking it really bad. She talked about seeing a therapist for a while, and we started looking into it but never got around to doing it. One of the problems is her and her rooommate kept getting into fights about stupid stuff but it was bad enough to where my gf moved out, she found a place to herself because she said she thought everything would be better if she was alone (I disagreed but understood and said okay). She wound up finding a new close group of friends who work with her that I had never met and started going out with them. This all seemed to make her in a good mood and stop her from making me skype her every day so I wasn't complaining. But after a while not skyping everyday turned into once a week, and no more good morning or goodnight texts. I started getting really busy during deployment and so I didn't really have time to think about it but she seemed to be going out every night of the week and drinking heavily. She knows how against drunk driving I am but I know she wound up doing it a few times. I was starting to think about mentioning all of this too her but wanted to wait until she came back late one time. Then last week, I got a call from her x-roommate (who is in bad terms with her but still close to me) who told me that one of the friends in her group (Let's call her Sally) called her to say that my gf has gone off the deep end and has been drinking heavily, doing drugs and is cheating on me.FACTS:- I trust my girlfriend more than anyone - She has done drugs in the past and is a total pot head but she rarely drinks has never done anything around me. - Her dad is an alcoholic and she never wants to be like that for personal reasons. She feels the same about the drugs she was doing- The drugs she was doing was coke, xanax, and morphine pills- She claimed she needed the drugs to numb the pain of wanting to (I believe this but have told her many times that I disagree and she needs to stop and we'll get therapy- Her coworkers are a bunch of gossipy bitches- She usually hangs out with guys because she doesn't like girl drama- I have confronted her with all my evidence and she denies cheating but said she had been taking drugs (she never actually lied about the drugs but was just afraid to tell me)EVIDENCE:- Her X-BF moved into town a week after I left and they hang out on occasion. She has confirmingly slept at his house twice and the first one she told me about and claims his brother was there (believable considering they live together). But initially she didn't admit the second until I confronted her and told her i knew. She was hanging out there instead of being at home with the roommate she was fighting with. This was one of the guys they claim she's cheating with but the only evidence I've heard is they hang out and she brings him down town.- She's stopped wearing my dog tags every where in the passed few weeks but I've heard mixed things about whether or not she wears her promise ring (unsure but she claims she never takes it off)- The main guy who they claim she is cheating (let's call him BOB) with is roommates with her friend's fuck buddy and the 4 of them hang out all the time. - Bob's roomie went to jail and my gf was there each night but claims that her friend was with her.- The people claimed that they always come into work together, but after confronting her she said that he lost his license so she drives him everywhere.- THE KICKER: Sally claims that BOB's roommate told her that Bob feels bad for hooking up with her because she has a bf oversees. My gf claimed that is a straight lie.CURRENT DECISION: I'm not 100% sure but i sent a message to BOB asking him if he has. It was a very nice and causal email saying that I'm not going to throw him under the bus I just want to know. I'm most likely just going to go with what ever he says because I don't think I can get anymore proof. What do you think?MY FINAL DECISION:The problem with posting online is the inability to give all the information about our previous and current relationship and see all the other things going on in person. I also want to say that I read everyone's post and I thank you first all the advice, ideas, tips, and opinions; it allows me to think logically about the situation without getting caught up in falling too much in love and making a bad decision. Many of you used the honest truth approach and I took no offense to anything. Thanks again.But I have made my decision and I DO NOT believe she was cheating on me. I had concluded that I can never 100% know so I stopped with the silent treatment and decided to talk to her, see her view, and see where it goes. This girl loves me, she would do anything for me but she was and is still in a lot of pain since I'm gone. She got some morphine pills from her friend and took a few and she said it helped her feel numb to the pain after a week of taking them she knew it was a problem but for the first time she had no depressed thoughts about being away from me. Then one day she woke up at noon and her first thought was not of me but it was, "where are my pills?" She said this thought made her realize she had a problem. Her friends were party people and although they claimed to be there for her no one wanted to listen to her about her problems of missing me and dealing with it. But Bob was there for her to listen, he only got involved because he didn't have a car and needed a ride to work and happen to be good at listening. He was the one who helped her realize she had a problem and took no part in giving to or taking drugs with her. When they started showing up to work together and leaving together the females started to talk, especially since she has always made it very known that she has a boyfriend that she's obsessed with (I have been told this by many people). But after she was taking the morphine, she stopped having strong missing me thoughts and simultaneously was always with Bob. When we talked she was really sad and crying about how Bob has been the guy who has been helping and listening to her and she wanted me to like him not be worried about her cheating. It was a bad situation but she knew how I would feel about the drugs and she was afraid to talk to me. But she told me about the morphine before I ever asked, the other drugs were something that happened on like 1 or 2 occasions in the heat of the morphine and alcohol but never developed into the problem. I'm not excusing any of this and she understands the severity, but with these accusations she knows that drug numbing is not even close to having this relationship end. I trust that she will be true on her claim to stop drinking and doing drugs completely (except weed but I'm tots fine with that).This next long paragraph is not facts but observations so take them as you will. The x-roommate who initially told me had heard from Sally who is currently one of my gf's closer friends and co-workers. She is just a simple stoner who is probably the most attractive of the group and that is ALL I know about her. I skyped her right after x-roomie told me to get her view. This conversation gave no facts, just observations. She didn't seem as worried about the drug problems as much as she was annoyed that her personality changed from happy stoner to alcoholic and started hanging out with a slightly different group of people that wasn't her. It was a "she's changed and is being annoying and she is most likely cheating on you", and "I heard that Bob's roommate said that Bob felt bad because she had a man overseas". When I asked her if she had any proof she said no but she'll try to see if she can get some, she just didn't want to be the person to tell her. During this whole conversation she was smiling with that flirty smile and kept repeating that she would never cheat, she's not like that. I know when a girl is flirting with me and it almost seemed like she was. Also, apparently some girls around the office have a crush on Bob which could be the jealously cause of some of the rumors. These things lead me to understand the possibility of false rumors starting. My gf said that she confronted Bob's roommate about his apparent statement and he was very taken aback and denied it (my gf's word). They all work at Buffalo Wild Wings (if that tells you anything about their maturity level LOL; no offense to anyone who works there; it's my girlfriends side job) and my honest conclusion on this matter is that the girls are gossipy bitches who have no credibility. Lastly but not leastly, after 2 full days of not getting back to me but having view all my messages, Bob finally responded (in the middle of my skype conversation with my gf which was like 2 hours long) and I will paste it below."[my name], first of all man I gotta ask you calm down I don't check Facebook hardly much less my messages so that's why I haven't replied yet. Continuing to attempt to calm your nerves I will have you know that nothing of any sexual, romantic, or even playful really has ever started to develop with me and [your gf]. Trust me when I say she was adamant from the first time we hung out about how in love with you she is. [my gf] is a good friend who has helped me and my roommate out a lot through a really tough time when nobody else really has. You should understand [my name], [my gf] is head over heels for you and the fact that you or anybody for that matter thinks she would leave you to mess around with me is devastating her right now. All she's done is lend a helping hand and i think somehow things got incredibly misconstrued by somebody who has no idea what's actually going on. If it makes you feel better [my name] I'll gladly back off and figure things out. Believe me when I say I'm astonished people are saying these things about myself personally when all I'm really trying to do is get a ride to work lol. So again if you have questions or whatever let me know man, I haven't even met you my man but the truth is you seem like a hell of a guy and [my name] is madly in love with you, of all people you really shouldn't be the one worrying. I hope that provides some peace of mind for ya"So, with that said, I know that his word is not the one I should be trusting but I was starting to believe my gf before I even read this. I went to him because whether or not I can trust him, he's the only person who can tell me yes and give me proof. Maybe everything I think now is wrong, but I'm going to stay with her. I love her and if it's going to work I need to trust her. If anything this can make us stronger but if it doesn't work out you guys have made me cautious and motivate me to do better. Thanks for reading...

Hi all, Looking to further my skill set as a product manager, and pick up a better understanding of what the developers I work with do. I've always been pretty savvy with web technology, and can dink around enough with HTML/CSS. But, I want to better understand how, exactly, things like MVC work in action, and why the little things always end up more challenging than anticipated. Anyway, I've been looking at these dev bootcamps not to become a developer, but rather to just become a more well-rounded PM. Partly so I can write better requirements and understand the concepts, but also to just be more helpful to the dev teams I work with overall. In some ways I'm approaching this as skill development to make myself more valuable to a future employer. What do y'all think?Thanks kindly.

3aze6c	-55571	1435172000	EntrepreneurRideAlong	Building my project in public and need your help	I've struggled with knowing where to start when starting new projects or businesses. There's a bunch of methodologies and frameworks out there, like Lean Startup, Business Model Generation, Design Thinking, etc. But yet I've struggled to just get started and produce something. As a way of trying to both kickstart myself and to validate my own project, I'm building a deck of ~20 cards that's like scaffolding for startup success. They're designed to help you get your idea out of your head and into the world by recrafting some of the well-established entrepreneurial frameworks. The difference is that I'm trying to sequence the most salient principles in a logical order to help you shortcut the pre-product phase of starting a startup.I'm doing this in public and need your help. **First**, I'm going to be writing about each card as a means of strength-testing the concept, and whether or not it is actually helpful. I could use your feedback on this. Is this framework helpful? Would you recommend it to an aspiring founder you know? Would you use it yourself? **Second**, I'd love feedback on the [current landing page](http://www.startastartup.io/), as well as the first four blog posts: [1](http://www.mattkiser.com/post/121121724036/scaffolding-for-starting-a-startup), [2](http://www.mattkiser.com/post/121710501361/startup-scaffolding-core-competencies), [3](http://www.mattkiser.com/post/122200095236/what-it-means-to-have-skin-in-the-game), [4](http://www.mattkiser.com/post/122353427261/on-the-importance-of-partnerships-when-starting-a).**Third**, if this is at all interesting to you, please consider joining the [newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/mattkiser).Thanks for your interest, Reddit!

The only thing that made the long, grueling hours even somewhat bearable was the reddit community. Anyways, when my boredom streak first started, I took to watching movies. I was watching something like 4 or 5 movies a day. It was ridiculous. This kept me entertained for a little while but then all I started feeling like I’d already seen everything and I started pausing the movie every 5 or 10 minutes to check reddit. It was so bad that the average 2 hour movie would take me 5 to get through, and at that point my comprehension of the movie was pretty bad as well. I watched Up the other day and I couldn’t follow the plot. Fucking *Up*, Reddit, I couldn’t follow a damn children’s movie. Skipping forward a bit, last night I decided that it was fapping time and I picked a threesome with two gorgeous blondes. So I’m sitting there watching the taller blonde with rosy lips and long legs riding this guy, and the camera angle is perfect because the tall blonde’s body blocks out most of the guy, and this girl is making out with the other blonde at the same time so this is basically one of the best porn videos in existence. And then *I tabbed over to start browsing reddit*. To be fair, I was waiting to see if a guy had finally responded to my rant on the geo-economic situation of Afghanistan, but still, kinda odd. So anyways Reddit, what the hell happened in Up? And what was the old guy’s problem?

tnn2e	-55595	1337053653	devils	Watching the games across the border...	So, my family decided to take a trip to Toronto during the Eastern Conference Finals and my father and I are HUGE devils fans. We watched the game at a sports bar in Toronto and even though we lost tonight there were a ton of Canadians who were sympathizing with my father and I. Apparently most of the Canadians up here dislike the Rangers just as much as we do, so if its any consolation for tonight's game 1 loss, we have the Canadians on our side. Lets hope they help our cause!!! Gotta love good ol' Canadia. Let's hope the Devils play like they did in the first two periods of game 1 for game 2. GO DEVILS!!!

Thanks everyone!

11kolk	-55595	1350402131	hockey	Organized Protest of the NHL Lockout	I get it. Everyone is pissed about the lockout, me especially. My beloved Devils went from being one of the worst teams in the NHL in the 2010-11 season to playing the Kings for the Stanley Cup in 2011-12 season, playing some of the most exciting hockey I've seen since their '03 Cup run. Now, my Devils along with every other team in the league has to sit and wait for talks about MONEY, something that has absolutely no bearing on the true essence of our beloved game, to be agreed upon to play. Whether you blame the owners, the players, or both, you are angry as all hell that this could happen not once, not twice, BUT THREE TIMES in less than 20 years. There is no sign of an end to the NHL lockout either with both sides stubbornly rooted in their own greediness. The NHL and the NHLPA are taking their fans for granted and expect the fans to come crawling back to keep up the record number of attendance and popularity the game has seen in the past few years. I know the Lockout is far from over, but we as a hockey community know that this game is more than just money. I believe if we could get a mass protest organized around both the USA and Canada, the NHL and the NHLPA may not take their fans for granted ever again. "Well Haltiamreptar21, how could this possibly be accomplished?" I'm glad you asked, hypothetical reader. I have an idea for a protest that may work.  * First, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlfK3yMiPVY) I am sure some of you have seen it before. For those who have not, it is a simple protest where the fans are silent for the first ten minutes of the game in order to show what the game would be like without the fans.  * I propose that instead of staying silent for the first ten minutes of the game, fans would gather at the entrance of each stadium around the NHL at the beginning of the first game after the lockout but not enter the stadium until the ten minute mark of the first period.  * This way fans who do not wish to support the NHL by buying tickets can participate in the protest and fans can stay outside the stadium for as long as they want in an effort to express their peaceful anger at the lockout. If you want to buy tickets and see the game please, go ahead as I completely understand the need to quench the thirst  that is the hockey fever but I implore you to please participate in the peaceful protest. * The only way this will be effective as a protest is if every fan base participates. Remember we are protesting against the idea of money running the game and taking hockey away from the fans, not the game itself. If only a few team fan bases participate, it may look like we are protesting our teams which is not the ultimate goal. Remember the bigger the protest, the better the results will be. If every stadium on opening night (whenever that may be) is empty for the first ten minutes of every game, think of how much respect and publicity the fans will get in support of our cause.  * TALK ABOUT IT WITH EVERYONE YOU KNOW. The only way this idea will spread is if you and everyone you know talks about it.  * THIS IS A PEACEFUL PROTEST. I know everyone is angry with the lockout but there is no need to use it as an excuse to flip cars, commit crimes, or start riots.  * I would like this to be posted in every NHL Team's subreddit so that any suggestions about coordinating a protest at each stadium may be discussed in the specific team's subreddit.  * Please let me know of any suggestions you have about this protest. I will wholeheartedly consider adding any suggestion that will help benefit the protest and get the message across to the NHL and the NHLPA that the fans will not be taken for granted.

153icq	-55595	1355898884	lotr	What about Gandalf?	So I just saw The Hobbit for the second time tonight and there was a scene where Gandalf discusses the 5 wizards of his order, himself, Sauruman The White , two blue wizards, and Radaghast the Brown (sorry if I butchered the spellings). Are there any books that go into depths of how these wizards met or how they became wizards at all or is it just a part of the story we have to take as is given? I'm not looking for a solid yes or no answer, I was just musing to myself and thought I would ask the LOTR reddit to see if anyone knew of anything about it.  
18exgj	-55595	1360718186	hockey	Does Clarkson's recent point production make you look at him any differently than before? I'm specifically wondering what non-Devil fans think. 	Before Clarkson starting putting up ridiculous numbers at the end of last season and into this season he was mainly a checking forward on the third line. He often reminded me of Sean Avery in his goonishness and terrible skating, as he was often found floundering on the ice for no apparent reason. This season, however, he has changed my view on his place on this team as he is leading the team in goals and points. He's also often found skating hard to get solid chances and not simply floundering on the ice after delivering a check. I wanted to know if you think this is the beginning of a skilled player or if he is still just a goon on a tear. Let me know what you think! GO DEVILS!!!

The only problem is that the basic 8gb set that had its price cut at target is now getting recalled and now most stores only have the 32gb black console. I heard that there may be an additional price drop or a new type of bundle that comes out after E3. Should I wait until after E3 to buy it or do you think the recall is just smoke and mirrors for something else?

I am a little confused after reading through all of the guides and recommendations about selecting the right graphics card. What separates graphics cards (besides prices, obviously)? I'm looking into three cards right now that are within the same price range and within my budget, Asus Radeon R9 270X 2GB DirectCU II Video Card, EVGA GeForce GTX 660 2GB Video Card, and MSI GeForce GTX 760 2GB TWIN FROZR Video Card. I'm looking to build a mid-range gaming computer capable of playing games like skyrim, elder scrolls, final fantasy type games, and maybe a few shooters like bioshock. What do you think I should go for? If you want to know more about the parts I am planning to use don't hesitate to ask, I am looking for all the advice I can get. Thanks again!

A weird looking guy wearing an unusual striped fur coat. He passes me, then comes back and politely says:Guy: Excuse me, can I ask you a question?Me: Umm, sure...Guy: Do you have a lot of female friends? Me: huh? yes... ?Guy: Oh! me too! We have this Jesus group!Me [*rolling my eyes*]Guy: [something, something] and Jesus told me that whenever I see someone with an upside down cross I should ask them to teach me how to fight. [[note the cross on my shoulder in the photo](http://i.imgur.com/SKPda.jpg)]Me: I'm sorry, I don't fight... Guy: But, can you teach me a few tricks?Me: I'm sorry, I'm not gonna fight you dude... Guy: but how do you deal with bullying [while pointing at the cross with his face]Me: [tapping my shoulder] this is my way of dealing with your people's bullyingGuy: [changing the topic] I detect a slight accent, where are you from?Me: I'm Palestinian... Guy: Oh! The land of Jesus! Me: Yes, so I know what I'm talking aboutGuy: Alright, thank you [*shaking my hand*]Me: Have a good evening, please don't fight anyone... ----He wasn't high or drunk, he was very polite and calm. I didn't stop thinking about it and my only theory is that he wanted me to show him a fighting trick or something appear to everyone that I'm attacking him so he can attack me back and call it self defense. But it seems to unlikely... and I realized that I'm trying to rationalize the actions of an irrational mind... **TL;DR:** a guy asks me to teach him how to fight because thats what jesus told him to ask a person with an upside down cross like that one I had in my shoulder...

I have a couple of theories, but I'm not sure:- The consistency surface tension of the non-watered down shampoo doesn't allow it to spread across the skin as much as the watered down shampoo, thus it doesn't feel as cold. - Shampoo has some sort of very weak chemicals that produce a subtle warm sensation.

I'm actually a 3D artist and I made this script as a school project and would like to add it to my current portfolio but I'd like nicer graphics than what is currently on the site. the script is free and will stay that way.

There is so much more I can do with my phone now, but I'm very disappointed that there is not obvious way to customize the mic button's functions. All it does right now is pause and play music, and skip with double pressed.

I rebooted and it worked fine before it crashed few min later. I left it off over night and this morning it seemed ok for few min before it crashed again. Now the problem is consistent. When I boot it I get artifacts on the very first boot screen, they disappear on the next screen where I'm asked which OS I want to boot. When windows is launched, it is ran on integrated graphics [I think, low resolution, no transparent windows Effects, no Dual screens, no 3D] I've reinstalled [clean install] the GPU drivers, I even tried moving the GPU to a different slot on the motherboard, it gave me an error and told me to put it back to slot one [on boot, the artifacts where still there]. Nothing made a difference. [Here is a really bad photo of the artifacts](http://i.imgur.com/gFHHo.jpg)[In the Device Manager it shows the GPU with an exclamation mark with no indication on what that means, not even a tool box when I hover over it.](http://i.imgur.com/q8nHZ.jpg)Is my GPU dead?

lvfv4	-55598	1320085827	bicycling	So I almost killed a fucking skateboarder last night!	I was biking in a busy 1 way downtown street. I'm stopped in front of cars at a red light. Green light comes on, I start pedaling. A car passes me close enough to force me into the gap between the lane and parked cars [I used to it by now]. I notice a skateboarder on the street skateboarding in the same gap I'm in but in the wrong way [I'm used to that too]! We're heading towards each other, make eye contact, I stop pedaling giving enough time to go around a parked car and back to the sidewalk. I get distracted by another car passing me. I look back ahead and the idiot skateboarder is still in my way [he passed the parked car and kept going toward me with no way to go]. I squeeze my breaks and yell "What the FUCK!" I get so close to hitting him he stops and falls into traffic! Another car passing me almost runs his head over slams its breaks and honks his horn. The retard gets up and starts yelling at the driver for honking! I, startled by the whole thing, yell "what are you doing!?". He says "huh?". "What the FUCK are you doing?!". "I'm skateboarding!". "You're going the wrong fucking way!". He says "Oh well" as he walks back to the sidewalk... **WHAT THE FUCK?!****TL;DR**a Skateboarder almost had his brain splattered all over the street and my bike for skating the wrong way down a busy street![Sorry for the language, I just had to rant!]

I was on my bike last night [with my lights on] on a tight 2 way street forcing me to take the lane [I've had so many close calls when cars pass me on that street]. I was going at about 35 km/h to keep the cars behind me happy. When out of no where I see a kid [~14 years old] on a dark tiny bmx bike wearing all black, no lights, no brakes, and looking at his friends on the sidewalk heading towards me on the wrong side of the road. So I lock my wheels. The kid finally sees me and did whatever kids do to stop brakeless bmx's. I hit him head on. Fortunately I was able to slow down enough to not cause him or my bike any damage, other than knocking my chain off my chain rings. All I could say is "what the fuck are you doing?!" to which he replied "Sorry, I wasn't looking, I'm sorry" before biking off. I'm just thankful that it was me who hit him and not an SUV. I hope that shook some sense into him.

Stuff like, no chewing on bike tires or furniture, no getting on the couch, etc...  **Edit:** I got him and spent about 3 hours with him walking and relaxing. I'm surprised how well behaved he is! He didn't show much interest in the bike tires, couch, shoes, hanging socks, Not even the trash can that had chicken skin in it! He's an awesome Doberman Husky Mix rescued from the street after he showed up at a foster family's house super skinny tired and with damaged teeth from chewing cans! Here is his petfinder page.

We just adopted Jack [\[pictures\]](http://imgur.com/a/6kjC8) is a super energetic 1 year old Doberman Husky Mix. He's so energetic that I can hardly keep up with him [4-6 walks a day]. He showed interest in chasing the light from my flash light, so I got a laser pointer from the dollar store last night. He loved it. He chased after it in the backyard for what it seemed forever. He stopped listening or playing with his toys, he kept running back and forth waiting for it to appear. He didn't follow me inside and instead stayed in the cold doing nothing but walk around and look for the laser. I thought. He nagged [like a husky] after we let him in for longer than usual. I just thought "Oh great, he really likes it". Tonight I played with it again, tried to tire him so he can calm down and sleep while we're out tonight. Oh no, he kept up. When I let him in he cried and nagged for a lot longer than usual [almost an hour] while breathing heavily and rapidly. He wouldn't let me do anything. I put him in his crate with his fav peanut butter stuffed town and turned off the light hoping he'd get distracted and calm down, but he's still making some low energy crying noise. I got worried and did a bit of research and realized how bad this could be for some dogs. The long lasting obsessions it creates. Holy crap! What can I do to fix this? I'm thinking I'll get him a clicker and start clicker training him like I've been wanting to, in hopes he'll forget about the laser. Any other suggestions? **TL;DR** My dog is now overly obsessed with the laser pointer I just got. Is there anything specific I can do to help him get over it? 
13l2dw	-55598	1353530928	dogs	I'm not sure if I can/should keep my newly adopted dog, Jack. I need some advice!	**EDIT:** So after reading all your responses and talking it over with my SO. We're keeping him. It seems that Jack read this post and started to behave better already! Or he's just starting to settle into the new environment and schedule. Thank you everyone!I've had [Jack](http://imgur.com/a/6kjC8#Mkdty) for 2 weeks on trial adoption. He's a super energetic 1-1.5 year old Doberman/Husky mix. He's a good boy, he's friendly to everything, perfectly house trained, he just pulls on the leash like there was no tomorrow. He was an abandoned dog that walked up to a foster family's door super skinny with damaged teeth from chewing cans and garbage.I love him, but here is why I'm having doubts about keeping him:1- He's super energetic, I take him on a leash walk first thing on a the morning, an hour of running at the dog park, and 2 other walks throughout the afternoon. It's still feels like he's missing something. I have relatively big backyard, but he doesn't like staying in it alone for long. I work from home so I can do all this, but I still have to work, and he takes up more time and attention that I can afford.2- I have knee issues from when I was a kid that just resurfaced from the excessive walking [I just realized that I've barely walked at all the past year, I've been biking everywhere] I'd bike with him but I'm worried about his pulling, he's pretty strong and could easily drag my bike from under me if he sees a squirrel.  3- He's been showing signs of aggression, biting the leash and thrashing his head without wagging or curling his tail like he does with a tug toy. This usually happen shortly after we leave the dog park. 4- He whines a lot, almost a couple of hours every night. Especially when we have company over. It's very annoying and gets on every ones' nerves.5- I don't have a lot of money for vet emergencies. I won't be able to drop more than a couple of hundred dollars at any point. I've been hearing about people having to spend thousands of dollars to save their pets. 6- I'm now constantly tired with no free time to do anything else. I feel like I can't stay up past 10 pm. So yeah, I'm worried that we can't keep up with him and his energy and that we're causing him more harm than good. I'm thinking he'll be happier with a family that has a yard and a dog his size to entertain each other all day. I've signed us up for a weekly obedience class that is a perquisite to an agility training class. Maybe that'll take some of the energy out of him, but if I can't ultimately keep him, I'd rather not to pay for a class I'm not gonna use. What do you guys think? **TL;DR:** I'm not sure I can keep up with my energetic young doberman Husky dog. Should I give him back to be adopted but a more suitable family or am I giving him too much attention and I should find ways to have him entertain himself?

A combination of clicker training, Obedience class, and an EasyWalk harness made an almost overnight change to loose leash walking. Now he doesn't pull at all, he even stays by me when walking off leash. He whines a lot less now that he's used to the schedule and he knows that walks are coming at some point. Now that he doesn't pull like a little elephant, my crappy knees are less of an issue, and he could spend more time running at the park. I think he's very close to being ready to bike with me too!I just wanted to thank you guys. I was really considering giving him back, if it wasn't for you and friends, I would have. I owe the next 10-15 years of love and joy to you guys!

14vnwh	-55598	1355543345	dogs	Travelling for the holidays with a large car-anxious dog? 	My SO and I are travelling to visit her family for Xmas. We're planning to take our 1 year old high energy Doberman/Husky mix dog. I've only seen experienced him in cars for a couple of 15 min Taxi rides. During those rides he seemed alert and somewhat anxious. If I didn't constantly distract him with treats he'd try to squeeze and jump his way to the front of the car. If I stop him or stop giving him treats he'll start whining, the type of whining that'd lead to barking [but I never let it reach that point to not freak out the driver, I never reward him for whining or barking otherwise].The plan is to travel in a van for 3-4 hours, stay one night at a family's house, travel for another hour the next day, stay there for Xmas, travel 5 hours to more family, then few days later, take a 6-7 hour train back home. I might be able to borrow a crate for the period but I doubt it'll help. When he was brought to our house from the foster's home in a crate, he barked the whole time. I was also told that medication can be an option. What do you guys think?

I've been trying to be friendly, risk my life for random strangers in need, try to declare my presence to survivors and my harmless intents. But I always end up with the short end of the stick. Until today, I saw a random survivor in a firehouse tower looting in peace. I wanted to see what would happen if I shoot first, you know, for science. I snuck up inside the firehouse and shot him. It turned out pretty great, I got his better weapon and medical supplies. But I felt like crap afterwards, remembered all those people who killed me after I've risked so much to get better weapons and promised not to do it again and headed to the empty woods of the north. a couple of hours later of running through tiny villages looking for a vehicle. I spotted a random survivor on top of the hill. I should've killed him, but I didn't I ran away for cover instead, only to be shot and killed by him. Now I understand why everyone kills everyone. From now on, if you have a weapon and I have something to lose, you better be running at the opposite direction!

169ltu	-55598	1357761625	dogs	Running with my dog triggers leash biting. I'm trying to train him so I can bike with him this summer. 	My Doberman/Husky mix Jack has had problems with leash biting when excited. I've worked on this with him over the 2.5 months I've had him. It's great now, almost never happens, and when it does, he responds to "No" right away. However, running with him on a leash always triggers the leash biting. As soon as I start running he'll bolt ahead of me and turn around to bite the leash. I always stop and say "No" and he'd stop. I've been doing this for a while now and it still hasn't improved. I'm a cyclist and not a runner, the goal of this whole thing is to make sure he's predictable and higher speeds on a leash. I got the Walky Dog attachment and I'm hoping to use it this summer.I use the Easy Walk harness to walk him, maybe that is what is triggering the leash biting? Would I need to get a different harness for when we start biking?

1bfaqj	-55598	1364827874	dogs	Questions about my dog's behavior when hooked on the Walky Dog [the bike attachment]	My Doberman Husky mix dog [Jack](http://imgur.com/a/iTg5d) is a1.5 years old ~70lb bundle of energy and misery. He's a puller when we're out on walks, so I have him on the Easy Walk harness. I bought him the [Walky Dog](http://site.thedogoutdoors.com/images/WalkyDogandladysmall.gif) bike leash over the winter. We just got to try it a couple of days ago and he went crazy! He realized that now he can pull harder to go faster. Despite him being a couple of feet away from the bike and hooked on the anti-pull harness, he was pulling me  [6'3" 230lb guy] on my heavy winter bike at ~25 km/hr without me pedaling! He'd pull like crazy, I have to half squeeze the brakes the whole time to manage his speed, but he keeps pulling and twisting the tightly clamped mount. Then he breathes so heavily and rapidly for a good 10-15 min after the 1km ride to and from the dog park. [Here is a crappy cellphone video of his breathing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMrgmrXw4o4) [he's waiting for permission to eat, thus the quick glancing up to me and down to his food].During his third ride [he broke the leach!](http://i.imgur.com/X6zxgAD.jpg) Thankfully it was a quiet street and he stopped when I called him. Judging from the breaking point, it broke from the friction with the end of the internal springs.**My questions are:**- How do I train him to walk/run along with the bike instead of pulling it?- Is there a better way of doing this? I'm gonna replace the rope with something stronger and try to find a way to smooth the ends of the springs.**TL:DR:** My dog pulled my bike like crazy and broke to leash, how to I stop him from pulling so much?

1cj7ws	-55598	1366208955	MontrealCycling	Bixi vs Buying a bike.	This was a comment I made on a post in /r/montreal. Now that the season is starting, I'm assuming people might find this useful. &gt;As a person who used Bixi the first 3 years before getting my own bike and learning bike maintenance in a year to be able to build my own bike and volunteer at bike shop, here are my thoughts:&gt;Bixi is great if you're only taking ~4 km trips or less. They're also great if you live next to multiple stations.&gt;They're not great for speed, my top speeds on a Bixi is ~25kmph vs ~40kmph on my high end hybrid bike [in the same season, I had to use bixi while my bike was in the shop after getting hit by a car]. The maintenance of Bixi has been going downhill, for the month I've used them last year, I picked up more bikes with flats and no braking power that usable bikes.&gt;You own bike is great for going fast and being free to where ever you want [there are actually amazing rides within the city away from Bixi's reach].&gt;It's also great for customization and functionality, you can throw on a rack and panniers and do your groceries on your bike.&gt;The bike theft is not a big issue if you get a good ~$40 lock, learn to lock it properly and keep it indoors overnights. It's insane how many bikes/parts I see everyday that I can steal with my bare hands in seconds.&gt;As for maintenance, I went to a bike co-op [Right to Move] where they teach you how to fix and maintain your bike. They're amazing, after few months of using the shop I learned so much and I started volunteering there. It's really not hard and shouldn't deter you from getting your own bike. At least you'd know your bike and it's flaws and won't be surprised to learn the Bixi you picked up doesn't have brakes going down the Atwater hill.&gt;Lastly, if you choose to buy a used bike, make sure you go on Kijiji as well as Craigslist. Kijiji has way more bikes for some reason. Ask your bike savvy friends [you can shoot me a PM too if you'd like] for feedback. Just DO NOT get a bike from Canadian Tire or Wallmart [or any department store really]
1cjelm	-55598	1366214201	MontrealCycling	Buying used bikes guide	Disclaimer: These notes are based on my personal observations shopping for bikes for family and friends. Buying a used bike is the best way to get more bang for your buck. Well treated bikes last for decades and just because a bike is used shouldn't deter you from buying it. Here are the things you need to figure out:* The type of bike:  [Road](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_bicycle) [aka speed]: They're generally lighter, faster, and more aerodynamic, but it's more expensive and less comfortable [they have a more aggressive pose leaning forward]. [Hybrid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_bicycle) [aka City]: They're generally less expensive, more comfortable, but their slightly heavier and less aerodynamic thus slower. [Mountain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_bicycle): They're great for off road biking, jumping curbs and all around heavy duty bikes. They're generally less expensive than road bikes but a lot heavier.  There are countless more specific types of bikes. If you're looking for on of them, chances are you don't need this guide to begin with. * Your bike size, riding a wrong size bike is not fun: http://www.ebicycles.com/bicycle-tools/frame-sizer Not all people selling bikes know the bike's size. If the size is not listed on the ads you're checking, ask the seller for their height.* Your budget, here is how used bikes break down to [Like everything else, you're more likely to fined better deals off season]: $100-200 the minimum for mostly functional old bike $200-300 for more options on functional bikes $300-400 the quality goes up greatly! With the rare amazing deals [I got my wife a  $1500 Devinci road bike, half carbon half aluminum for $350, but those deals are rare in winter and even rarer in the spring] $400-600 Really good hybrids and pretty good road bikes $600-1000 Great road bikes $1000+ you'll be racing with the pros!* Check Kijiji as well as Craigslist. Kijiji has way more bike for some reason.* Check often If you find a bike you like for a good price JUMP ON IT! Good deals don't last. I've missed out on so many for calling an hour after the post has been made.**Once you find a bike you like and go to see it, here is some basic things to look for:*** If the bike is stolen. There is no sure practical way to check here are some tips:  Ask about the history of the bike, where they got it from, why they're selling it, any recent upgrades/changes they've made. If you meet the seller at their home, usually it means it's not stolen. If the seller is using their cellphone for communication as opposed to an impersonal email. Check if the [Serial Number](http://www.cambridgema.gov/cpd/communityresources/~/media/B4FF3C35BDAC4B808CFA18760A116F37.ashx?w=380&amp;h=309&amp;as=1) has been filed off. Use your gut feeling. By buying a stolen bike, you're not only risk your bike taken from you if the original owner finds it, you're also fueling the big bike theft problem in Montreal that'll make it more likely for your bike to be stolen. * Take it on a test ride, test the brakes, shifting, steering... etc.* Check if the wheels are straight or if they wobble when they spin. Lift the wheel off the ground, spin it with your hand, look at the brake pads and see if the rim is wobbling closer or further in relation to them. Any more than 1-2mm wobble should be fixed [$10-$15 at any bike shop, or by yourself for free with the help of volunteers at Right to Move bike co-op] * Make sure the hubs are tight enough/the wheel axles are not broken. Lift the wheel off the ground, grab the rim and try to move it sideways, it shouldn't rock back and forth at all. * Check the shifting off the bike, make sure that if it's indexed shifting [clicks as you shift] that each shift actually moves the chain. Make sure to listen if the chain is rubbing against anything after each shift. That's all I can think of right now. Other than the bike theft issue, these are not deal breakers and very fixable, but they'll give you an idea and some negotiating power. Will update as I remember or people suggest more stuff.

We biked for 6-7 km at around 25-35 km/h with few breaks including an hour at the dog park. Last night [4 hours after running] and today he seemed so sore and tired. He's acting normal [rolling around on the couch with us, eating, great interest in house guests, and jumps up whenever I put my sweater or boots on in hopes of going for a walk] but it seems it's hard for him to walk. He takes short slow steps, shifting his weight around, and lies down slower than usual. He's not avoiding stepping on any specific limb/paw. There were no cuts or bruises that we could find, we also applied gentle pressure on the different parts of his legs to see if it's a localized injury, he didn't react. He seemed to enjoy it when we massaged his muscles. What do you guys think? Have your dogs experienced something like that? Should I be running to the vet?

Here is the example I'm working on which almost works but not quite yet. http://i.imgur.com/B7RWFQt.pngWhat I want: When I press Z, I want Matinee to skip to .5 sec and stay pause. When I press X, I want Matinee to skip to .75 sec and stay paused. When I press Z again, I want it to skip back to .5 and stay paused and so on... What actually happens with this setup: When I press Z to go to .5 or X to go to .75, it skips to the right time and stay paused [as it should], but when I press either Z or X it plays the animation from the current position, if I press either, it pauses it, if I press either, it plays it again. Only when the animation is done, I can press either Z to go to .5 or X to go to .75, to skip to the right time and so on... Any ideas? I tried checking the Rewind On Play box, I've tried connecting the nodes to the stop and play ports on the Matinee with no luck!

Should I be freaking out and taking an emergency appointment at the vet or should I just clean the wound and let it heal naturally?

He somehow scratched it out badly without us noticing. Got Anti-biotics and anti-inflammatory drugs to help. Thank you everyone

2fabrm	-55598	1409686370	gamedev	Just wrote up a post about our decision to switch from UDK to Unity3D for our game, Anamorphine	After making our gameplay demo in UDK, we're switching to Unity for the actual full game. Here is the post with a comparison between Unity5, Unreal4, UDK, and Unity4:http://anamorphine.com/post/96469337510/the-great-engine-migration&gt; After many months of blood, sweat, and alcohol making our demo in UDK, we’ve reached a crossroad.  It was time to upgrade the game from a hobby project into a financially viable project. We had to decide which tech to use for our game, a crucial decision that is cheap to make now but very expensive to change later down the road.&gt; UDK served us well,  it’s free and we both had previous experience working with it! We could make a proof of concept without any upfront monetary costs, countless evenings of work not counted. However, we knew we were nearing the limits of what we can do with it. We were tired of having to trick the engine to force it to do what we want, as it fought us every step of the way. The lack of consistent documentation and code access were becoming intolerable, not to mentioned the ridiculously high 25% royalty.&gt; &gt; After the release of gameplay demo earlier this year and the attention it got, we knew we had something viable. We now can invest in an engine like Unity pro. We both had experience with it, and the local and online dev community is massive compared to UDK. It’s much more open and compliant to what we needed it to do. We knew it could take quite a bit of work to make it look as good as it would’ve looked in UDK, but honestly, we’d rather put those hours into improving the games visuals than putting them into the constant fight with UDK, and with the introduction of the new shaders of Unity 5 we suspect it won’t be an issue!&gt; &gt; So yes, we’ve made the switch to Unity Pro! We got all the tech from the UDK demo working in Unity and all the art assets were easily integratable.The only thing left is learning the limitations of the lighting engines, something we might not have to worry about once Unity 5 comes out with the Enlighten engine.&gt; &gt; And then, BAM! The very same week we’ve made the decision to switch Epic releases Unreal 4! Much cheaper than Unity Pro, much more open and pretty than UDK. We played around with it, it looked great, it felt great, but we stuck by our choice for the many reasons listed below.&gt; &gt; Here is our Pros and Cons list of the engines we looked at. It is specific to our game so your results may vary

2pii3e	-55598	1418768280	Steam	How I won $165 worth of software for $20 through the Steam Auctions!	I know there is a lot of hate for Steam's new Gem/Auction systems, but there was potential. I mentioned in another thread that I was working towards a specific goal and I'd do a write up about, so here it is.Disclaimers: I didn't take advantage of the gem exploit, I only knew about Gems and auctions Sunday afternoon, way after it was fixed. I also didn't have any cards, I never saw the point of them and sold any card I got as soon as I got it. I also didn't know what I was doing, I learned a lot along the way.All prices are in Canadian $.**TL:DR at the bottom.** So, I'm a 3D artist and a game dev (shameless plug, my game, [Anamorphine](anamorphine.com)). I've wanted a program but it cost $165 for a long time, very inexpensive by industry standards, but for a game with a -$3K budget, it's pretty expensive.As soon as I learned with Steam auctions and gems are, I decided to spend the day playing the few games I got through Humble Bundles that I never played before to see what I can get. 1 card later, I realized how worthless it is compared the 100k bids that were already set for $10 games, then I checked the software I wanted and knew was available on steam and voila, it was there with much lower bids!I just had to figure out how to get gems more productively, I had around $1.5 in my steam wallet from cards and CSGO items I sold, I went into the market for the first time and see what I can do. I knew stickers and other non-card items had a better gem value. I didn't know gem packs were being sold, I think that page was broken/under heavy traffic. Instead I started buying 3-7 cent items and seeing how many gems I could get.I couldn't figure out the exact criteria on which the gem value of an item was but I recognized a pattern, as long as there are only 1-3 items at the lowest price range. 7 cent items were generally worth 80 gems, 6 were worth 80, 5 were worth 60. If there are more than 1-3 items at that price it was generally 20-40 gems less than that rate.I quickly figure out the top two rates were the 6 for 80 (13.3 gems per cent) and 5 for 60 (12 gems per cent). 7 for 80 wasn't a bad deal either but not the best. I spent hours scrolling through the market buying one of each item that met the pattern, checking the gem value, then buying the rest of it. I also decided to add $10 to my wallet to keep doing it. I got around 14,000 gems this wayA while later, I was able to access the gem pack market page, they were at 65 cents per 1000 gems! That's a much better deal than what I was hunting for, but I got greedy and thought the price would drop. It dropped to 63 cents before rocketing to $1.15. I caught it at around 80 cents, I got an additional $5 worth.Later Sunday night, I figured out that as soon as the auctions started and people became desperate, the prices will spike again, so I bought another $5 worth at ~80 cents rate. Boy was I right!I went all in with an 25,690 gem bid. I was #8. The first round went ok, it was at 72k, next few rounds it dropped to 50k, then the 30k mark, I kept bring bumped back to #7-9. Snipers would come in at the last min and out bid the top bidder and bump us all down. by round 17 snipers seemed to slow down and bids were more stable. I went to bed, then today at 5 am, I won round 26! I think I got lucky cause soon after the bid amount went back up the the low 30s and high 20s.I ended up with 2 gem packs left that I sold at $1.47 each, almost twice the amount I paid for them. I’m posting this so people can learn from my experience, I’m not saying the name of the software here until the auction is over, to give a fair chance to people still bidding, but it’s not hard to find if you look for it. There were a couple of mistakes I almost made and fucked up my chances. I thought the priced of gems would drop because there were more sellers than buyers at the lowest rate, I was wrong. I got greedy and thought since I was #8 on that one, I could bid on a bundle that included the software I wanted but was 50% more expensive. I was #50 on that one. I think it was wise to stick with this single program because it was the second expensive thing on steam, the bundle was the most expensive thing at $265. People who were looking for pure $ value for their gems would probably go bid there. I also assumed that the bid price will keep going down and thought if I was #8 I could drop out and bid near the end to save gems, I was wrong, the price stabilized in the lower 30s and higher 20’s. I would’ve missed out. **TL:DR** I got a $165 piece of software for $20 and sold the leftover gems for almost twuce what I paid for them..

2x4yan	-55598	1424888659	dogs	I've been feeding my dog Purina food and he's been not eating and occasionally puking/regurgitating for the last few weeks. Should I be conserened about the recent news?	note: I've been to the vet, they suspect gastrointestinal issue and are trying special food that've been working out. I'm posting this to see if my dog's symptoms could be caused by the alleged poisoning of Purina foods.[Jack is a 3.5 year old healthy Doberman Husky mix](http://i.imgur.com/xlvaram.png). We've been feeding him Purina Dog Chow (The green bag) not Beneful, the brand which the [lawsuit](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/lawsuit-claims-purinas-beneful-poisoning-killing-dogs-n312176) is targetting. Earlier this year he stopped eating as much (a quarter to a half of his daily food), he started making very loud digestion noises at night and mornings, he occasionally pukes or regurgitates his food, and sometimes makes weird breathing noises (which I later learned were hiccups). These symptoms happened around a very cold wave here in Montreal, Canada which caused us not to walk him as much, so we thought that caused the reduced eating.According to the lawsuit, the food caused internal stomach bleeding and lesions on the liver, could my dog's symptoms be caused by the food? I'll be calling my vet but she only works at the hospital on Sundays and my dog is doing much better with the new food treatment, so it's not an emergency. Note: We tried switching him to better food last year but he got a hotspot behind his ear shorty after, the vet suspected it was an allergic reaction and advised us to go back to the old food. We've been hesitant to switch to something else since. We're definitely not going back to Purina though!

Doran	A little while back, I was contacted to receive and review the book Mastering UDK Game Development by John P. Doran which can be purchased athttp://www.packtpub.com/mastering-ud...velopment/book &amp; http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Game...sr_1_1?ie=UTF8Mastering UDK Game Development by John P. DoranThis book is about creating gameplay in UDK. It's content is broken up into "Projects" representing creating a gameplay element or expanding on one. It jumps right into showing the basic steps to setup a side-scrolling platformer game camera, controls, power-ups. etc. using existing UDK assets in Kismet. It's a great introduction to basic level and gameplay creation without getting deep into content creation.The second project gets more advanced with content and kismet with a space rail-shooter game. This covers importing custom meshes, textures, creating materials and particles. The basic knowledge one needs. Another fantastic gameplay example. Project three expands on this adding enemies and additional asteroids with more extensive kismet operations. The final part, Project four covers creating a custom HUD. A thorough walk-through of using scaleform, importing and implementing. For the fledgling designer and advanced user alike, there's a lot of great information in this group of projects.Project five studies creating an environment scenes using the castle assets included with UDK with great points on material instances, set dressing, and basic lighting. A great chapter for the beginner artist.Project six Dynamic Loot explains placing a torch on the ground, picking it up and carrying it. And Project seven goes deeper into scaleform for setting up an inventory. These two go together well as essential information for game makers wanting to expand a project.Project eight is an introduction to UnrealScript. A fantastic addition after covering basic art and kismet. The final control everythingMastering UDK Game Development is a solid source of information for the beginner and advanced users. It also includes file links to projects discussed allowing the user to dig in and really learn. The book is well organized with with a lot of preemptive information for the uninitiated, and I'd suggest it to anyone looking for information on it's topics.

He kept going until jumping the rail in which York put him in a chin lock and threw forearms to the back before security escorted him out. He thought you had to make a statement before joining the wrestling school. Promoter smartened him up outside, he joined the school, and everything was good. He did well and ended up in plenty of matches.A heel working the crowd got them hot, someone jumped the rail but before they got to them an outside ref grabbed them and threw the guy out. Backstage, the heel joked that he was worried from throwing so many work punches that he might not have known how to throw a real one. Maybe 50 miles out of town, I stopped for gas. A guy behind the counter recognized me and asked why would he antagonize people. Maybe because he's a heel. Weird for me as my only spot was faking an eating contest with kids at the show (indie wrestling is weird), but made me fell validated with my shitty spot on the card.Generally speaking. They didn't happen much. Good staff watches people and try to jump on them before the wrestlers (worker) get to them so they don't get hurt. Working security at shows isn't too bad. If you attack a wrestler you're probably going to take a beating. Don't do it.

21al51	-55601	1395718912	SquaredCircle	Let's Discuss Cena's Great Matches with New Talent	I've noticed John Cena putting on a lot of great matches lately with newer talent. Part of this goes to the unique abilities possessed by guys like Bryan and Cesaro. I also believe Cena has a great set of skills, we're just gotten used to him versus the same offense.SummerSlam clean lose to Bryan in a great match. This was also the start of DB vs The Authority.vs. Damien Sandow when he cashed in MitB. Good match, hot crowd, unfortunately not going anywhere for Sandow. Maybe after WM. vs. Cesaro a few weeks ago on RAW. A huge boost to the Cesaro stock with the fans and also said to be a big hit backstage. Tonight vs. [Luke Harper, again great match the crowd really got into. Harper just needs these moments to shine before everyone realizes he's a top guy.](/spoiler)EDIT: Thanks oldfat, forgot to say, Mention more if you know 'em!

26ukf0	-55601	1401422854	WredditSchool	Running the Ropes	Neville vs Kidd got me thinking about hitting the ropes because they both use different styles of hitting them. Kidd uses the single arm lean where you drape the right arm over the rope, and grabbing on, leaning a bit to the side (usually what you see in WWE). Neville does the same, but also drops the left arm to snag the second rope with the back flat against the ropes (often used in Lucha).For the uninitiated, when running the ropes, you have a high chance of falling through the middle and top rope. Additionally, should the rope break it can save you a nasty fall. Also a reason some find grabbing the second rope as well to be more safe.An example of untrained rop running was the first time [David Flair hits the ropes he almost goes through them](http://youtu.be/9U-M8nnGJxY?t=2m6s). Note the top rope shooting up hitting him in the back of the neck. This could have gone very bad.---How were you trained to hit the ropes, and what philosophies and dangers were you warned of?Where I trained, the single arm lean. Proper footwork navigating the ring was also important, but not so much the topic I was going for.

Constant chants for her, each time Rusev would get out of the ring and make her move somewhere else. Long, hard-hitting match from these two!Intermission**Fandango def Adam Rose**. Rosa was a hoot after the match, kept trying to get in the ring several times to attack Fandango. **New Day vs Ascension vs Cesaro &amp; Kidd**, Triple threat for the tag team championship. New Day had crazy heat and constant chants. Wild tornado style tag match. Lots of great work from New Day, Cesaro &amp; Kidd. Ascension were mostly props in this one.Main Event**Dean Ambrose def Luke Harper** in a Street Fight! Great match with plenty of toys. Both went through tables before it was over with Dean getting the win via elbow from the top rope on Harper through a table. Interesting note: They turned off ALL the lights because ring spotlights including entrance graphics, scrolling WWE logos around the sides of the arena, etc. Really gave the whole match a great atmosphere.Overall had a great time, and I'll try to post some pics later.

Many public/private schools offer sports. If your school has amatuer wrestlings that's a huge bonus. Plenty of wrestlers came up through American football, and martial arts welcome all ages.

Naturally, she found my entire collection of pipes. Seven pipes, all one of a kind.  She told me about it, and has forced me into drug therapy. If I don't go, I am disowned.  So today I spent the whole day looking for weed. I finally found some, and the deal was witnessed by a cop I had to run from. I lost the weed while running, but couldn't get the money back. None of my friends are answering their phones to console my sad, sad ass.  Just keep me in your stoney thoughts, trees, and burn one for this sad, lonely ent.

1bjdck	-55606	1364933574	Borderlands	The pearlescent weapons I've found so far	I decided to take my modded character and run through UVHM at level 61 with the drop rate totally cranked up.  Here are the pearls I have found so far:**Unforgiven:**http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=136292953PistolJakobs76988 Damage98.6 Accuracy2.4 Fire Rate2.1 Reload Speed8 Round Clip"It's a helluva thing..."It seems to not stop at walls, but instead bounce around until it hits an enemy. That might be the case, I don't really know because it is hard to tell exactly what is going on.  Either way, it does a HUGE amount of damage, even compared to other level 61 Pearl weapons. **EDIT:**  a nice man just told me that the Trick Shot prefix is what is causing the bouncing bullets. I wasn't aware and I apologize for my error.  I will say that this thing does more per shot than most snipers, so it is still devastating. **EDIT 2:** I did not realize it, but this thing does insane crit damage. I found another one that is not a Trick Shot, and it has a 89K base damage. it does 600K critical hit damage, so I am guessing around 500% crit damage is another stat for this gun.**Storm:**http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=136292879Sniper Rifle (Only a level 60, not a 61, so a 61's stats would be, presumably, much higher)Maliwan64293 Damage96.8 Accuracy1.1 Fire Rate4.0 Reload Speed6 Round Clip12240.6 Electric Damage56.3% Chance to Shock"Tut, Tut, it looks like rain"When the shot hits something, a huge, Norfleet-like explosion happens. it then gives way to lots of flashing sparks, like the Flakker. Judging by the name, I am guessing it only comes in shock (and since the other legendary Maliwan sniper is only fire).**Avenger:**http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=136292936SMGTediore20322 Damage93.3 Accuracy9.3 Fire Rate1.5 Reload Speed49 Round Clip15% Chance to Slag"Counterbution revengence. The reckoning"When thrown (reloaded) it bounces around on the ground, firing full auto randomly in circles. Doesn't seem to be able to hit the player, but it might. after a short while, it explodes like normal.  absolutely devastating with slag in a crowd. just throw one in, and then bask in that sweet, sweet x3 damage. **EDIT:** apparently, according to some on the gearbox forums, this gun regenerates ammo. I don't know what that means or if it is true, but that's what they're saying**Butcher:**http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=136292903Shotgun (this is the first one I found, so it is only level 52 and is totally underpowered compared to the others. however, I am including it because it totally rocks the fucking house.)Hyperion5837x3 Damage77.1 Accuracy7.0 Fire Rate2.9 Reload Speed12 Round Clip4604.4 Corrosive Damage8% Chance to Corrode"Fresh Meat!"This is the best shotgun in the game. the fire rate is insane for a shotgun. the accuracy gets high a lot faster than the hearbreaker or CC, and stays higher longer. it definitely shoots more than 3 pellets per shot, and does a fuckload of damage. I definitely want this thing at 61 ASAP!Regarding where these dropped, they were all from random bandits and lockers (and one from a Dahl chest). and since I have it set that if a weapon is going to drop, it's going to be legendary, I can guess that these guns have the lowest drop rate imaginable.  I saw probably 30 legendaries at least between each pearl. If you are gonna farm these (I have no idea who or what is most likely to drop them), be prepared to get frustrated.a few notes about UVHM: you current legendaries are going to go out of style fast. this is hard city, even with a modded character trying to run through it as fast as possible.  leveling up didn't take as along as I expected, though I only went through 2 levels legitimately.  and the game scales everything to your level. if you level up in an area, the chests will still be leveled to the one you were at when you entered the area.  This is exactly the kind of content that I think a lot of people stuck at End Game were looking for.If any of you guys find any other ones, be sure to post them. I can't wait to get all these mother fuckers and become the ultimate badass.**AUTHOR'S NOTE** for anyone who hates modding the game, don't worry, this guy never sees the light of day. he has never been online, and he never will be unless I am playing with friends. I have a legit character that I will be playing UVHM with, so don't bitch about the fact that I am cheating.**EDITING WITH NEW GUNS!!!!**as I find new ones, I'll add their info here.**Stalker:**http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=136313807PistolVladof36435 Damage77.3 Accuracy10.5 Fire Rate2.4 Reload Speed41 Round Clip18% Chance to Slag"You can run, but you can't hide"It's like a little baby shreddifier. has an insane fire rate for a pistol. it shoots slower moving projectiles that bounce off of a surface or two before stopping.  in crowds, it's total madness. This one was found in a chest, and even though my drop rates are through the roof, it means that there is still a small chance to find one in a locker/dumpster/ammo chest/anything that can spawn legendaries, so leave no trash can un-rifled through.**Bearcat:**http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=136338314Assault RifleDahl37577x3 Damage90.6 Accuracy3.7 Fire Rate3.5 Reload Speed39 Round Clip13831.7 Corrosive Damage6% Chance to Corrode"I love the smell of popcorn in the morning"this thing shoots 3 grenades in a spread. they bounce twice and then explode. the explosions of grenades will throw other ones around, so it gets a little chaotic.  it costs 6 ammo per shot.**Tunguska:**http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=136373799Rocket LauncherBandit890761 Damage79.2 Accuracy0.9 Fire Rate7 Reload Speed4 Round Clip"It will split the sky in two"the rocket has a slight arch to it, and it bounces up to head height when it hits the ground (it bounces the same amount off of walls if it hits a wall instead of the ground) and explodes.

Why? (a)Sunlight is composed of many colors.(b)Tiny particles in the air scatter the light.(c)The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.(d)Water droplets scatter different colors through different anglesFeedback:Particles in the air scatter light in all directions. You can think of the surface of each particle as having many tiny facets oriented in all different ways (like a cut diamond, but not so discretely). Each tiny facet reflects light into a different direction. When the strong direct light from the sun is blocked, your eyes can pick up the weak reflected light from some of the small particles suspended in air with just the right surface orientation. These glittering particles allow you to trace the paths of the incident sunlight. If the particles are tiny water droplets, light can also be refracted through them into your eys. In the morning there is often a light mist which provides a source of particles. The combination of reflection and refraction can also result in rainbows if the sunlight is coming from behind.Are a, b and d not the answers?That, however, is marked incorrectly.C) is correct but I don't understand its inclusion as one of the possible answers.

After reading peoples symptoms that were caused by this and then seeing how people have changed really inspired me. I recognize and have the same symptoms so many of you have and I fucking hate it. I decided it was time to get my ass in gear!I approached a close friend about joining me in a "30-day challenge" but really my goal is continue this for life. I posed it as a challenge to him so that he would join me and we (really just I) could have someone to talk to about this when I'm struggling. We are on day 3 and I can already feel the urges building up and very anxious if I can do this. I'm very interested in how the mind works so I am embracing all of the things that will come with this experience. I feel like fapping is what I struggle with the most in life and if I can change this habit I (hope) will really get my self confidence back. Anyway, I'm rambling but I just wanted to post on here for some extra accountability and support. And to say thanks to this thread as a whole. This is a fucking awesome thing and I'm grateful to all who are supporting each other in this fight. Wish us luck!

I've read several articles about Louisville being on the list for several things. Seems like a great city but I've never been. We're visiting soon but wanted to see what reddit had to say.

xeiff	-55646	1343672393	Heavymind	Proposal for ranking system, similar to ents	So I was thinking about this subreddit and I realized that just about the only gripe I have with it is that sometimes, things are just too heavy for me. A lot of posts seem to be coming that that dark place in the mind, the place where you know truth and can see it for its falsity."Don't depend on other people, because even your shadow leaves you in darkness." I discovered this quote yesterday, and was thinking about it on and off. By the end of the day i had realized why it was so transfixing. What it says to me is that you can only truly be alone in darkness, and thus can only know yourself in that dark, heavy place in your mind. This, to me, means that you can't really be yourself around other people, which was a really, really heavy thought to me. Like, I was in that state where you're thinking 'damn... all hope is lost, you can never truly be who you want to, never truly accomplish anything.' And to me, that is a very heavy mindset.So last night, I was at a [10]. Right now, I'm around [3]. And sometimes, people post things at a [10] that you can only really understand if you're in a 10-mindset. I haven't thought at all about notation either, but I don't really have time to now. I think the biggest problem would be how we use them, but I think it would be pretty cool if we could discuss why we think something is a 3 as opposed to a 7. Could lead to some pretty cool stuff, new ways of looking at the world, etc.

1entv6	-55646	1369007741	Psychonaut	Do we choose our sexuality?	Well, do we choose where we live? Partly yes, partly no. Even if it was entirely your own decision to live in the city you are living in, there are probably other houses you wanted to live in, or other neighbourhoods. But as we get comfortable, the fact that we didn't have a choice doesn't matter. We become attached to our surroundings. Maybe you wanted a better television but you could not afford it. Are you still happy to watch your favorite show on it? OF COURSE! Whether or not we make a choice is inconsequential because sexuality is such a complex thing. None of us decided to live on Earth, or be born to our families, or meet or best friends, but we are still glad when life takes us there. Life can be your best friend or your worst enemy. It's all about perspective.--Peace, Love, Happiness--Note: If you think of any subreddits where this would be more appropriate please tell me. This was the most relevant one I could think of :P

2lpotd	-55646	1415487171	HipsterHeads	Classic Albums: Foo Fighters - The Colour and The Shape	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijNk5kXq0tE&amp;list=PL68D098F602DDFD23They don't really make this kind of music anymore.The reason they still play Nirvana on the radio is that people still aren't sure whether they really changed anything. To me, that's a good sign that they really did change the way people think about music. Think what you want about the sound, there was something about the energy of Nirvana that just seemed to make a lot of sense. The Foo Fighters are an incredibly important band in that regard. Though they change their sound a lot and don't play the most technically proficient music, they have been making sweet tunes for close to 15 years and are still going. Dave Grohl's breadth and longevity with Foo Fighters, on top of his part in Nirvana, has proved he has earned him the title of Original Hipster. This is where that long journey began.OK, it was the second step, but this is where things really kicked off. It's still their best selling album, not that that necessarily says anything about its quality. The first Foo album, self-titled, was essentially a bunch of demos scraped together from Dave's basement, slightly polished and put out under a silly name. When people liked the singles [Big Me, This is a Call, Alone + Easy Target], he got some more people in his band and decided to just go for it.The 90's was a weird time for rock music. The pretentious anti-everything mentality that has spurred rock music since it was created took a loud, heavy turn in the form of the grunge 'movement.' Skinhead punk rock and LA materialism collided into an orgy of violence that was somehow sweetly poetic. As a matter of fact, Dave Grohl got to Nirvana from LA, where he was broke and unemployed (he grew up in DC).Half of the music here is loud, screaming, and even brutal at times. The other half is soft balladry many people would describe as 'alternative rock.' At first glance it's pretty cliché and stereotypical, but hey, we're talking about the Foo Fighters. The whole point is that Dave never abandoned the good 'ol rock and roll spirit despite all  the angst and anger. This album comes straight from the heart, and though the story of an angry kid with a broken heart has be done to death, it makes a hell of a lot of sense within the trajectory of Dave Grohl's career.The Foo Fighters would obviously not be around if it hadn't been for Kurt Cobain's suicide, and Dave is so good at keeping his mouth shut that people still think he might just be riding his coattails. If you really listen to this whole album, it's very clear that Dave Grohl in forging his own path. A very diverse sound with heartfelt and insightful lyrics, he has continued to carry the torch of the awkward loner rockstar without leaning too much on his dead friend's legacy. He gets my full respect.1. Doll almost sounds like an incomplete song, but that's only because it's the intro. It sounds good, but it doesn't have much meat to it. The lyrics - "You know in all of that time that we've shared / I've never been so scared / Doll me up in my bad luck" - hint that the album might have a pretty serious or dramatic tone. It's easy to miss, but it is sets the stage for what is to come.2. Monkey Wrench, the first single. Bright, fast, fun, and with an incredibly angry bridge, it's an angsty jam that kicks and punches. Makes me want to jump around and dance and scream.3. Hey Johnny Park! is a hard rocker that's a bit depressing with a cool riff. Dave says the song is named after a childhood friend he missed and hoped might get in touch with him if he heard a song was named after him. The chorus could mean anything, but the soft background vocals give it a sense of melancholy.4. My Poor Brain. A personal favourite. Really nails the soft/hard dynamic that is so core to the Foo's sound. The sound of loud feedback crawls through the speakers before abruptly cutting to Dave singing softly "This life is so hard / we sleep in the stars" to a light, slightly upbeat guitar. You start to strain your ears in order to hear - and then the cannons fire. "This is a blackout / Don't let it go to waste." And of course the angry bridge - "sometime I feel I'm getting stuck / between the handshake and the fuck." A great song to sing along to.5. Wind Up is all angst. Loud, abrasive, and with a short but sweet chorus, it's a fun little ditty. The words are pretty hard to make out, especially with the whiny high-pitched riff that buzzes around the verses like a mosquito. But take a minute to read the lyrics because this is one of the songs that shows how awesome Dave Grohl is at being a self-conscious angry rock god.6. Up in Arms takes it down a couple notches, then steps it right back up, though not quite as intensely. At it's core is an endearing song about messy relationships, but the change in tone makes it a fun jam, and the solo is the icing on the cake.7. My Hero is the album's third single, and one of Foo Fighter's most popular and enduring songs. It's easy to think it's about Kurt, and it probably is, but the song isn't really glorifying its subject - "Watch him as he goes / there goes my hero / he's ordinary". The key is the line repeated in every verse - "use that evidence / race it around." Dave is saying the world stole his hero from him, and he's angry and sad because he can't understand why. His hero has fallen.8. See You is really jumpy and upbeat, which is a bit disorienting after the pummelling that preceded it, but it makes the album digestible. A bit of filler.9. Enough Space, ironically, comes after the filler. It's obviously about a relationship, though it could be with a girl, his fans, or his industry. Another great soft/loud song that makes you punch the air and sing along.10. February Stars is my favourite song on this album. Gets me right in the feels. It made me cry once or twice. It's all in the lyrics - "hanging on / here until I'm gone / right where I belong / just hanging on" - "even though I watched you come and go / how was I to know / you'd steal the show?" - "one day I'll have enough to gamble / I'll wait to hear your final call / bet it all" - "even though / pass the time alone / somewhere so alone / it heals the soul" - "you ask for walls, I'll build them higher / we'll lie in shadows of them all / I'd stand but they're much too tall / And I fall" - and the kicker - "temporary scars / february stars". For some reason I've always felt that the little bass fill just before the part about walls is like a little breath of fresh air. This song is like the anchor that keep the album from drifting away to sea. Transcendental.11. Everlong, the second single. Possibly the Foo Fighter's most popular song, though probably not. The lyrics are pretty angsty, but the main riff walks such a fine line between heavy and bright that it's easy to get lost in the sound. Uses the soft/loud dynamic to stellar effect. Fuckin classic.12. Walking After You was the fourth single, but I don't think it got anywhere. The music video is pretty shitty and kinda creepy, though I think its meant to be a bit of a parody. It's a great tune nonetheless. A soothing, comfortable sound with lyrics about twisted relationships, and a melancholic guitar riff near the end. A bit depressing, but the chorus shows a resolve to persevere.13. My Way Home is a perfect closing song. This is the kind of song that makes me think this band is really something special. The way it builds at the end shows the true power of the soft/loud dynamic that most people see in Smells Like Teen Spirit. Another transcendental one, in that it makes you forget who you are. It's not a casual listen. If you are digging this song, you will forget who you are and become Dave Grohl. And what is the point of having rockstars if not for that very reason? It starts off with some driving power chords, switches to a nice soft verse, and then switches back and forth a couple times. The lyrics are about being depressed and woken up suddenly and "If you could manage me / I'll try to manage you / but lately it's all I ever do." Then it breaks into a cheery, bright part, where the lyrics go "I'll never tell you the secrets I'm holding / I know these things must bore you / But I can't find another way /  I'll never tell you the secrets I'm holding / I love this leash that holds me / When I try to run away". It's a twisted bit of juxtaposition, and it's absolutely beautiful. But then it gets quiet. Almost too quiet. You strain your ears to listen and you hear the main idea being whispered. Why is he whispering so quietly about how he isn't scared? Is it because he's actually really scared? But now there's some drums... and a bit of bass... he's starting to sound a lot less scared now... I'm not sure where this is going, what's happening, where am I, who am I - holy shit, he's definitely not scared any more. "I'm not scared / I felt like this on my way home / I'm not scared / I pass boats and the kingdom." The wording may be a bit awkward, but if you're feeling shitty and this song doesn't help you might want to go get a therapist.
2lpxi8	-55646	1415492571	HipsterHeads	Introductory Propaganda	I'm a 22 year old white Jewish Canadian male. I have a deep love for music. It's almost more of a religion to me than Judaism. I set this up as a broader spinoff of [r/HipHopHeads](http://www.reddit.com/r/HipHopHeads). I was listening to the new Foo Fighters music and thinking about how much of a boss Dave Grohl is. In many ways he's an OG. He was in Nirvana and has been going strong with the Foos for almost 15 years. He branches out to a lot of different sounds and even made an album with a second acoustic disc. He's made a movie, sound city, about the recording studio they made Nevermind in, which had a shit ton of famous musicians who also recorded there. He has a miniseries on HBO about the history of American music to promote his new album that he travelled all over the country to record.So Dave Grohl is an Original Hipster. I was really happy to come up with that. It's a beautiful idea. For some reason I often find it hard to go back to certain music because I feel like I already know everything it says. I thought I did with Foo Fighters, but I listened to the Colour and the Shape all the way through today, possibly for the first time ever, and it felt like a classic. You know how albums just feel like they'll always be there, like you'll keep coming back to them over and over again? That's how I feel about at least 3 Foo Fighters albums. But nobody talks about Foo Fighters like that. There's too many excuses - they're too mainstream, they haven't spawned any obvious knockoffs, and of course there's always the argument that they're just a Nirvana ripoff. But I really want to talk about it. So much that I came up with an idea for a new sub: r/HipsterHeads.I don't really believe in hipsters. The word comes from back in the day when people would use the word hip to say something was popular. If you're really into all the popular things all the time it's usually pretty obnoxious. There exists a false stigma for people who genuinely dig something popular for their own selfish reasons. If you really like a certain product and it happens to be popular, there's no point feeling ashamed about it. Nobody actually invests their time and energy into something they don't believe in, especially when it's just music. Everybody has a heart.So here's my 'credentials'. I grew up listening to the Beatles, Bob Dylan, and Pink Floyd. Eventually I got into metal and more modern rock music. I listened to a lot of U2, Chili Peppers, Pearl jam, and Metallica in highschool. I liked Kanye growing up because my siblings loved him and he made awesome music videos and had songs like Family Business (my personal favourite) and Roses. I miss the days when hip-hop was 50 Cent and Eminem rather than Drake and Lil Wayne. My friends and I like to listen to hardcore/metal like Protest the Hero, and weird electronic music, especially minimal tech house and darkpsy/goa, but we always have a couple mainstream pop songs in heavy rotation. My highschool discovered dubstep in 2009, about a year before Skrillex exploded. I found my entry point into hip-hop through electronic music around February 2012 - around the time I read the entire wikipedia page on the history of hip-hop. I tried memorizing Wu-Tang's Triumph and JMT's I Who Have Nothing so I could learn how to listen to lyrics, to moderate success. I'm obsessed with Death Grips and Run the Jewels. I listened to Yeezus 10 times in the first 3 days after it leaked. I watch a lot of DeadEndHipHop and NeedleDrop. Something just kind of clicked this summer when Bluesfest (I live in ottawa) had Action Bronson, Snoop DoggLion, Childish Gambino, Tyler, and Deltron all within a couple days of each other, and I started really digging Illmatic. (I also saw Kendrick at Folkfest. How can I not be a hipster living in this city? It's usually boring as fuck and our festival names make no sense anymore) I recently started listening to black metal and death metal (Deafheaven is the shit), I love Black Moth Super Rainbow and Sufjan Stevens, I have at least 200GB of music downloaded (though I mostly stream nowadays), and I am an avid record collector. I also play bass guitar in a blues jam group with some highschool friends, though we've never played a show. We do Hendrix, Chuck Berry, Stevie Ray, and John Mayer. Also a nasty bare-bones version of Booker T. and the MG's Green Onions. I think this could be a brilliant idea but it is going to be really hard. Hipsters are notoriously awful people. And I have no clue what I'm doing. I used to use reddit a lot but I stopped a couple years ago, and I was always a lurker. I've set up the subreddit but I'm going to need help. So who's down?

I tried signing up for Rogers One Number because apparently it lets you track your phone, but they sent a PIN to my phone that I need to verify my registration :/Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!UPDATE: Thanks for the advice guys! I totally forgot about this post. It was in the car :S

I was on duty at a concert, it was during summer and was during a really hot heatwave people were waring summer clothes (ie not very many clothes at all) and drinking all day from about 3/4 in the afternoon, the concert continued till 11 pm so when it started to get dark it became very cold very quickly. This girl had been drinking all day, When I found her she was unconscious and quickly becoming hypothermic so I called for transport to hospital. She began to convulse while i was waiting for the ambulance. I didn't do much but if I hadn't found her when I did and called for transport their is a strong chance she would have died. I want to hear of any stories you might have of saving someones life?

So you are standing in the front door and you are hearing things, I'm not sure what I would do? My instinct tells me that I would bust in and confront them.Curious to what you guys would do. Would you bust in and kick his ass? or do you run away, cry and confront her later? or something else entirely?

I recently turned off the music in-game (don't get me wrong, I love the OST) whilst playing post-game throughout Velen + Skellige cleaning up the remaining witcher contracts and side-quests, and...I never really appreciated just how amazing the sound design in this game is. I've never felt so peaceful in a game world, as I galloped across no-man's land, listening to the heavy thuds as Roach's hooves met the ground beneath. Hearing the idle conversation of passers-by, even the sound of creaking wood and babbling brooks. Simply amazing immersion.So if you ever want to try something new, turn of the music and just, listen. Be it for a few minutes or an entire new playthrough, I couldn't recommend it enough! p.s combat with bandits is strangely satisfying when all you can hear is their hilarious threats, the clash of blades and the eventually expiring groan as each of them is sliced down.
3b374m	-55670	1435249687	BatmanArkham	Concerning challenge maps...	I'm just as bummed out at the lack of proper challenge maps, but unless they have been locked behind the season pass and DO already exist, don't keep your hopes up. Here's why:1. To introduce challenge maps, Rocksteady would need to write up new dialogue recordings for all of the characters they have made playable at some point throughout the main game (Harley Quinn, Red Hood, Catwoman, Nightwing etc) Now, recording a few intro lines for each character as they enter the challenge map (as in the previous games' challenge maps) might not sounds like much, but all those playable characters mount up. 2. Possible new challenge maps to be created? This could be avoided, as they do have the locations for the AR challenges, but these are hardly expansive and interesting locations. 3. Apart from Harley and Red Hood (? I have not played the red hood DLC, so I can't say), all the other characters you play as are never used outside of combat missions, thus there would need to be more programming for those characters stealth options.Essentially, if legitimate challenge maps aren't hidden in the season pass, I don't think we'll be seeing them at all.

ehdvh	-55683	1291687836	trees	I just bought pot from my boss. [0]	I was on a business trip with coworkers. One was my peer, a beer drinking, loudly cursing "bro" who regularly degraded women with his language and attitude. My kind of scum. The other was my seemingly straight-edge boss. One night, after eating dinner at Carrabba's, we were walking back to the hotel and he says "So do you guys smoke? Sweet, let's go smoke some pot in my room."I just moved to town about 5 months ago after graduating grad school and looking for a job, keeping clean in case of a piss test. Then I couldn't find any pot, even from people who I knew smoked. I was starting to think of smoking spice again, that shit sucks, but it does get you high. Meanwhile this joker has been getting high every day, right under my nose.So, I just wanted to share with the ent community my new joy. I'm just waiting for my girlfriend to leave now so I can enjoy it in peace.

gu6cv	-55683	1303272900	Pegging	I just told my gf I want to try something new.	I have been lurking in r/pegging for a few months now. It has been a fantasy of mine (I'm a guy) but I never knew how to bring it up with my longtime gf. Strangely enough, it kind of came up in conversation so I mentioned I'd like to try. Now, I must go about getting the toy and making it happen. I am excited to get out there, but also want to make sure it's fun for her too. I'm thinking of watching some porn with her first. Any thoughts?

k2xp9	-55683	1315001049	trees	How do I ask my neighbor to be my dealer?	I'm pretty sure the neighbor across the street is a drug dealer. There are always random people pulling up and going in at all hours of the day and night. They usually honk their car horns for a while or shout the dealer's name at the window to get let into the building. It's kind of annoying with the car horns at midnite on a tuesday but it's not like I've never bought drugs before so whatever. I would just stand outside and honk my horn but I live with my girlfriend who I don't want to alert to the fact that I'm looking for weed (I know I know, I should just be honest, but it's better this way, she'll just make a whole thing out of it).My point is that although this guy (or girl) is trying to keep a low profile, they are definitely not. I need a solid weed connection and I need a way of getting some without attracting mucho attention.  Any ideas from the ent community?

At the moment, I currently only have about 2 pimples here and there, but I still have a lot of hyperpigmentation from acne. Although I have been using Murads' post acne lightening gel for about 4 months, the hyperpigmentation still seems to be as prevalent as before.

On monday the chemical burn turned a slight brown much like hyperpigmentation. During the night because the area was so dry I decided to do OCM with mineral oil on the area...which was a horrible idea because it opened up the burn again. Is there anyway that I can help heal this? I know that I shouldn't have picked on the area but I was incredibly stupid.Thanks in advance!

2nosji	-55709	1417201139	tretinoin	Incorporating Tretinoin .1% into my routine	Hi, about 6 months ago I was prescribed Tretinoin .1% by my doctor for my acne. Back then my routine was very basic mostly just washing my face with cetaphil, stridex red, a moisturizer, and sunscreen. Because I didn't know how to use tretinoin properly I got a crazy amount of dryness, irritation, and I began breaking out pretty bad so I stopped using it. It is 6 months later and I have improved my skincare routine by a lot, but I have read on /r/Skincareaddiction that tretinoin could possibly be a miracle worker for my skin and PiH. The problem is many people have said that starting out on Tretinoin .1% maybe too harsh on my skin to begin with. Because tretinoin is extremely expensive I will be unable to ask my doctor if I can start with .025 or .05%. I'm at a loss at to what I should do now,if I should just not try the tretinoin tube that I already have or use it and hope for the best again.

Hey im a newb and now that I understand the basic CSS and html codes a whole new world of options opens which makes me wonder is all these options equally important or do web developers take shorcuts.What exactly goes into building a website for a customer?

How important CMS or is it even used, if yes in what situations?Essentially im just wondering what the real b2b process looks like for a webdesigner from getting the job to delivering it.In advance thanks, I really appriciate it.
qust9	-55723	1331660169	jquery	Jquery animations making other elements move.	I've just been wondering, when using commands like .fadeIn, fadeOut, hide, show etc. In my case I have a blockquote with a button under it that hides the quote if its shown and shows it if it isnt. The problem is that the button moves up whenever it hides and down again when it shows. Is it possible to make the button stay without resorting to .css commands like .css('visibility', 'hidden')?Is is possible to do it by giving the button an absolute position? - this would be last resort since if I changed the quote for a longer quote I wouldnt want to have to go in and change the position of the button again.Anyway hope it makes sense, and thanks.

r45fp	-55723	1332196987	PHP	So I want to learn PhP	When I first started trying to figure out how to make a website it seems as if the treasure map followed 3 steps: html -&gt; css -&gt; js... I learned how to build a site, style it and create events. I even learned how to make a form, but back in my mind I knew that these forms didnt do anything. You filled the blank spots and it showed up in the URL. I quickly realised that I'd have to travel further to reach the treasure. However now I can see this huge mountain emerge in the horizon. Its called php and I have no idea how to go about it.I'd love if anyone knew a good source of good tutorials, books or anything. I have no idea what php is other than its server side while JS is client side and I need to learn php in order to handle forms, users and what not.Anyway, any help is appriciated &lt;3

And if I go from the content of contact to the content of other tabs it makes the height equal to the height of contact and then "jumps" back. I guess the problem is the difference in height of the contents.Anyway try it out, im sure you can see what my problem is. Thanks!edit: the #load is just the spinning gif in the top right corner.
rxsbl	-55723	1333801777	javascript	problems using splice and push to move objects from one array to another.	Noob here. I have  array A with objects in it and another empty array B. I want to take an object from array A and move it to array B.My problem is B.push( A.splice(0,1) ) returns an array which means array B end up being 2 dimensional. However I just want array B to be a one dimensional array of objects just like array A.Now if I had said B.push(A[0]) it would do what I want it to, but in this case I have a function which I want to return A[0] and splice it aswell. But since you cant splice it before returning it (because then its gone when you want to return it) and you cant do anything after returning, I dont know what to do.thanks!

I've seen a lot of people using several templates (have no idea if thats the word for it) like html5 boilerplate, twitter bootstrap and maybe even more.They both include some resets and base stylings for a lot of html elements. Do you guys include all the stylesheets and then your own after it, in which order do you place them, or how do you go about it?Does it effect performance?It just seem wrong to include stylings in one stylesheet just to have it overwritten in next, but I guess thats ok if it doesnt impact performance.Thanks.
szszq	-55723	1335798362	javascript	A couple of silly questions.	Hey guys, I have been learning how to code during the last 2month or so using codeacademy and nettuts, and even thou I've learned a lot I still sit with a couple of what I imagine to be silly questions, so here we go:1: What is the difference between these 2 ways of writing a function (notice first example is not a contructor just a normal function):    function reddit() {} and     var reddit = function(){};2: When having a class contructor, why is that you would want to set something as a variable and then use methods to set the variable and get the variable.    function Reddit() {        var number = 10;        this.setNumber = function(newNumber) {            number = newNumber;        };        this.getNumber = function() {            return number;        };    }What is the difference between that and this:    function Reddit() {        this.number = 10;    }and then just being able to change it by saying for example me.number = 20;3: There seem to be a difference between calling a function with or without parentheses after it. like writing    reddit();or     reddit;Thanks a in advance

uuio6	-55723	1339332087	webdev	Is it ok to combine PHP and JS in one file?	Hey guys fairly new. Basicly I have a site with a bunch of tables filled with input fields where the values are retrieved using mysql queries. I then use ajax to update the rows on blur or enter. I use ajax because I want to update the site without the user having to refresh the page. For example I want to remove rows if an input is set to 0 and update some divs which shows the sum of a column much like excel. My problem is since I use ajax I need to use values like id to send to my external php file. For now I just store the id in an attribute for each input field along with some other info like which collum it is, but is that considered bad practice? It feels like bad practice. I could have my entire script at the bottom of the page and then store the values in an array while I loop through the rows and then hand it to the script at the bottom of the page.This might be very basic, but im very green. So how do people go about it, when they need to use variables from PHP in JS?

For people who arent familiar with mtgo, the left column is cards, the 2 middle columns are buy and sell prices and the right column doesnt matter.I know I can use file() to get each line as an array, however I do not know how to continue after that. file() seems to strip extra spaces (I dont know for sure) so I cant see how I could use something like explode to turn it into a 2d array.Any help would be appreciated thanks.

The idea is that whenever you take an action, it will do the action in the logic and add the corresponding animation to the stack (array for animations). Once all logic is done and all animations have been added to the stack it will loop through the animations recursively and publish a game state/phase. Is this a good way to do it?Also is it fine to have the closure be an object literal and structure it the way I did? I'd like any feedback. Thanks!

14dt6o	-55723	1354802734	PHP	Laravel: is this a secure way to do password reset?	Hey I'm making a site in laravel which includes a login system. I've had to make a system for resetting password. I've tried following examples aswell as doing it to the best of my abilities. However I'm not experienced and I'm very paranoid which is a very exhausting combination. Therefor I'd love to get some feedback even if its just calling me a scrub.Basicly the way I've done it is that when a user enters a wrong combination they get an error with a link to a form where they can enter their email.http://pastebin.com/fv7aPxfLIt then generates a hash aswell as an expiration date and stores that in the database. Then it sends an email with a link which includes the hash and the user id (this is to avoid collision). http://pastebin.com/20QhDc53When the user clicks the link it takes him to a reset form where he/her can choose a new pw and repeat it. It stores the id and the hash in the session aswell as a session expiration time of time() + 1hour.http://pastebin.com/Z52BP7wRI store all this in session because I want to be able to validate and send them back to the form with errors, is this nessecary? should I just force them to click the link in the email again? When the form is submitted it flushes the session, creates a new hash in the user table aswell as sets the expiration time to time(). It then updates the password and logs them in.http://pastebin.com/hY1ptzZKSorry about the wall. Hopefully someone will check it out and point out any holes. As I said I dont have a ton of experience and im very paranoid. Thanks!

But, as you might know, you can see the mac address of the AP on a sticker on the AP. So essentially there is nothing preventing a user from taking out the AP, reading off the AP's mac address and then setting the address in Kali or whatever and now he has access to the management VLAN.How do you prevent this, any advice?
2ozlep	-55723	1418318345	networking	When will the counter on an ASA access list increment?	I have an issue with a server which is on the same subnet as as the ASA and the ASA is the default gateway. I can remote desktop to the server so TCP initiated from the outside works. Servers Firewall is disabled.The DNS server is located on another subnet and when the server does a DNS lookup the access list entry counter is incremented, so it looks like UDP works from the inside.However no matter what type of TCP traffic I do sourced from the server it wont work, and no TCP access list entry is incremented. So I suspect the TCP traffic either doesn't reach the ASA or I don't understand when the counter is incremented.So my question is. Does the counter increment after handshake is done or is it incremented as soon as it hits the ASA?http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa82/configuration/guide/config/acl_logging.html says:&gt;The ASA generates a system message at the first hit and at the end of each interval, identifying the total number of hits during the interval. At the end of each interval, the ASA resets the hit count to 0. If no packets match the ACE during an interval, the ASA deletes the flow entrySo it seems as if it should increment as soon as it hits the firewall, but it still doesn't make any sense. Anyone experienced something like this?Edit: Restarting the server solved the problem.

One of labs was bugged I'm sure. Also I was not able to use ? so lab a lot.I used study guide, study guide tests, lab manual for old exam, old INE, CBT and BOSON test exam. Boson has a ton of PPPoE and NHRP so it's quite good, but my confidence took a pretty big hit when I first tried it, which was probably a good thing.

Hello Reddit!We are a small team of developers who spent the last year creating a game called Artizens. It's a 2D online co-op platforming game, inspired by Monster Hunter and Megaman, where you fight hard boss monsters and features intense character customization, all the way up to drawing your own gear. You can learn more about the game at our [Kickstarter page](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/artizens/artizens-0).We started work on Artizens a little over a year ago. We all quit our jobs so that we could work on Artizens full-time and we cut our expenses as much as possible (mmm that ramen). Since then, we've hired a team, designed the game, coded the framework and tools that support the game, and launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funding.In this AMA are:- Charles (artizens_charles) - co-founder and game designer- Nash (artizens_nash) - co-founder and music composer- Kai (artizens_kai) - co-founder and programmer- Derrick (artizens_derrick) - programmer- Simon (twinconceivable) - animator- Howie (Howi3) - artistWe'll be here for the rest of the day. Please ask us about the game, game development, our history, anything you want![Proof](http://www.artizensonline.com/blog/reddit-ama-jan-24)**UPDATE**:Thanks everyone, what a great AMA! There are lots of things to read about Artizens here, so make sure to give it a read through. If you have more questions, come over to our subreddit at /r/artizens and post them.

My lease is up next month and while my rent is barely being raised - $36 more in rent and $10 more for parking - I kinda feel like asking to maintain my current pricing. I live in a unique loft style unit in the building. It's a large building but there are only six lofts and one has been empty for at least the last six months so it's not like they could turn my unit around quickly if I left. There is a lot more competition in the neighborhood too. During the past year 3 brand new apartment buildings have gone up within a block of where I am. Is it worth bringing up to the management when I go to sign another lease?

The family I got her from had rescued her from what sounded like a backyard breeder that was sending her to a shelter in retirement because she was too old to continue breeding. According to them she'd had 2 litters, but the vet I brought her to said she's never had a C-section. She's pretty small for a Boston too, in fact her original name was Midget, and from what I've read they always need to give birth via C-section. Anyone know if it's feasibly possible for her to actually have had litters naturally?

While it's done absolute wonders for her rash/allergies, about 3-4 days after starting it she needed to go potty every 2-3 hours. The vet tested for a UTI and while he didn't really see anything gave us the meds for one anyways. We completed the entire round but she still needs to go out all the time. She manages to make it through the day while I'm at work without any accidents, but every night consistently wakes me up to go out every 2-3 hours. I've tried to pretend to be asleep but she keeps pawing at me and will start whining. While frequent urination isn't listed as a common side effect of Apoquel, is it perhaps a less common one?

I can't afford the surgery so have made the difficult decision to surrender her and her sister Abby back to Best Friend Rodent Rescue where I adopted them from. Unfortunately I'm not hearing back from them and I have an early flight to California tomorrow for a wedding. I don't want to leave Belle alone over the weekend with her tumor getting worse so am hoping to find someone who could care for them and potentially meet up with BFRR if they're available over the weekend. Otherwise I could pick the girls back up Sunday afternoon. I know it's a lot to ask too, but hoping that whoever fosters has an extra cage they can stay in as I don't have time to completely scrub it out tonight to have it ready for transportation. Anyways, please message me for more information if you're available. TIA!

A little over a week ago Maddie had a photo shoot with a professional photographer who had been at PAWSwalk. She had a blast, and tonight was my appointment to review the pics and decide what I wanted to order. 51 amazingly adorable photos got edited down to 19 then 9 and then finally I couldn't get it down past 6. Spent way more than I had planned, but loved them all. I get the digitals next week so will post them then!

2l7epq	-55747	1415056462	BostonTerrier	Some random Boston questions	Maddie and I have been together for almost a year now and through this subreddit I've learned that some of her quirks, like blanket nests/caves, are standard behavior for Boston's. There's other things where I'm still a bit curious if it's just a Maddie thing or if others behave the same way, so here's a few questions...Does your Boston have trouble standing up from the frog legs position? Especially when on the bed she'll sometimes need to flail around for awhile before she can get the momentum to stand up.Would/has your Boston defended you in a rough situation? Maddie is so incredibly friendly with strangers that I sometimes wonder if we were out on our 2am walk and came in to a bad situation if she'd become their best friend or try to protect me. Granted she is incredibly defensive of our back porch - when the maintenance guy comes by to sweep up she is relentless in barking/growling at the windows.I swear there was something else I was going to ask but can't think of it and my lunch break is almost up! :) I'll post in the comments if I remember...TIA!

He was telling me about a Mexican restaurant he and his wife went to before but now that they live there they can't remember the name or where it is. A defining feature is that the chips and salsa were self serve and the chips were kept hot in an old popcorn machine. Anyone know where this is? TIA!

2qqdaz	-55747	1419878165	BostonTerrier	Pumpkin and rice for diarrhea - how much and how often?	Maddie started having some diarrhea on Friday evening which isn't too uncommon for her. Being on Apoquel makes her poo soft/loose to start with. Saturday morning she snuck part of a ham sandwich she found on the ground. Being allergic to gluten it's done a number on her tummy. I took away her regular food Saturday afternoon when I realized this was going to be a prolonged case. Saturday night she pooed out the paper wrapper from the sandwich and has been acting like she feels better since. She wants to play and clearly wants to eat. I started her on some pumpkin and white rice yesterday and her stool is getting more solid, but she acts like she's starving and is begging for more. She's seven years old and twenty pounds - how much is okay to give?

2wq0vh	-55747	1424573067	BostonTerrier	Anyone else's Boston just kinda grumpy/pouty all winter?	I got Maddie a couple days after Christmas of 2013 and at first she was very lazy, didn't want to play, and kinda pouty. I initially attributed it to her getting used to her new home. She was always snuggly and sweet but I never saw that silly Boston grin. As it started to get warmer and Spring came she definitely perked up and became playful but I thought it had more to do with us being a real family by then than the weather. Now though I'm seeing the same thing. She spends most of the day laying around, doesn't really get playing unless I'm pushing her to it, etc. Is this normal for a Boston just because of the colder weather?
2xysgd	-55747	1425514570	AskVet	Looking for additional opinions - 7yo spayed Boston Terrier w/diarrhea every 3 weeks	Species: Dog - Boston TerrierAge: 7 years oldSex/Neuter status: Female - Spayed at 6 years oldBreed: Boston TerrierBody weight: ranges 18-20lbsHistory: Adopted Maddie just over a year ago at 6 years old so have no history before that. Her foster home did confirm that she is allergic to gluten. She takes 5.4mg of Apoquel daily for her allergies which has caused her to have softer poo.Clinical signs: Sudden onset of diarrhea roughly every 3 weeks - goes from squishy poo to straight water/liquid to pudding and then back to squishy poo.Duration: First real instance of diarrhea was in October 2014. Had a few times for a day here and there between Oct-Dec but not much. December 27th had it again lasting almost a week, however I'm guessing this time it was longer since I was also sick and wasn't able to get her meds sooner. Again Feb 8th for approximately 3 days, again starting Feb 28th and we're now on our 4th day. Meds given by vet are Endosorb and Metrodiazole.Your general location: Seattle, WA
2y028w	-55747	1425540253	Disneyland	More questions about a nice family dinner out - Tortilla Jo's?	I posted a little while ago about my dad taking all of us to DL to celebrate his 60th birthday and that my sister and I would like to surprise him by taking us all out to dinner one night. Many people suggested Blue Bayou which looked amazing, but after talking with my sister it's a little out of her price range plus I wasn't thinking about all the dietary restrictions we have. There is one incredibly picky adult, 2 kids (5 y/o who can't have gluten and 7 y/o), 2 adults that can't eat gluten, and one additional adult that can't have gluten, soy, or dairy. Bah! So after narrowing down the price range and looking through the menus the only place I can seem to come up with that I think everyone would agree on is Tortilla Jo's in Downtown Disney. Thoughts? Reviews? Good place for 5 adults and 2 kids?

I'm trying to make a sheet for my team at work where based on their drop down Yes or No answer to 4 different questions it will give a canned response of what the correct form to use is. There are six possible canned responses. I know how to do the drop downs, but what I'm having trouble with is how to get the canned response based on the answers. I can catch on to a tutorial pretty quickly, but don't know what this is called to search for it. I looked in to conditional lists and IF formulas but neither seems to be quite right.

39d179	-55747	1433977609	BostonTerrier	What do you use to clean your Boston's bum?	I originally used Organic Oscar wipes but $13.99 for 75 wipes was a little pricey. I then started using Earth Bath hypo-allergenic wipes at $9.75 for 100 wipes...but man baby wipes are so much cheaper. Needing to really clean out under her tail and in the crevices of her corkscrew every other day plus wipe her bum whenever she's got a spot of poo hanging out means we go through them pretty quick. Started looking at Huggies Natural Care wipes that are hypo-allergenic and dye/fragrance free...and $2.49 for 65! Do you think they're safe for dogs too? What do you use?
3ahrkv	-55747	1434787888	BostonTerrier	Saw a comment a few weeks ago about a Boston rescued from a NW WA backyard breeder - was that you?	Can't seem to find it again when searching this subreddit. My Maddie was "rescued" from a breeder in Arlington. Basically the breeders told a friend of theirs that they were going to take her to a shelter since she was too old to keep breeding and that person knew a woman that fostered dogs so she took her in so that Maddie (then Midget) never had to go to a shelter. Anyways, just thought maybe they were from the same place and maybe you'd have some info or even possibly one of her babies! :)

[If Only You Knew...]	They say that love is patient, love is kind,And that love, too, is also blind.Love is what I have experienced with you,And these feelings I hold to myself so true.You showed me love in my darkest days,You showed me your love in many ways.You proved to me your love was no myth,An everlasting love, and endless abyss.But now I sit here, alone and cold,Left here by myself with no one to hold...This love, you say, will never be the same,With my biggest mistake, you have put me to shame...No one said that love is perfect,It takes two people to make love worth it.But why must I feel this way,When it's your love that gets me through every day...To love and not be loved in return,It makes my heart ache, my stomach churn...It makes me regret the things I said,If only I told you how much I love you instead...But there is nothing I can do about the past,If only I knew how long this will last...This world without your love just isn't the same,But I feel that I only have myself to blame...I reach for you, and you push me away,Knowing this makes it hard to get through the day...Despite this pain, I somehow get by,Secretly hoping that your mentality is a lie...This pain I feel is so deep, so dark,Like a scar, surely leaving its mark...Open or closed, my eyes see the same,The same darkness that shadows my shame...In this darkness, love is hard to see,I've been here before, but can it really be?Back in this place where no light shines?But your lack of love has me first in line...Does my heart deserve such a hopeless fate?Can this be the end? Am I too late?...Only time will tell, I will rise and fall,And see if love truly conquers all...

I can't seem to have any luck at all with it and it continually crashes, so I think it is time to look for something better. What is your favorite tool and why?

1q6wj7	-55770	1383934567	LucidDreaming	First (second) time lucid dreaming!	Sorry for the wall of text I am just excited and this is my first post here!Had an interesting experience last night, I went to a big concert and danced my ass off (something I never do) and got to bed around 3am. I had my first real lucid dream experience since joining this subreddit! Its my second and a half time actually lucid dreaming! Here is how it went: I was in the elevator with a good friend of mine, who in the dream I very much had a crush on (we are completely platonic in real life, just good friends). At some point for whatever reason I turn to her as were getting off the elevator and ask her to give me a blowjob. At that moment I become lucid and tell her I know its just a dream and that im asleep but Id like it if she would. She refuses and I reiterate that I know im dreaming but it would be cool if she did. She refuses, so I walk up to another random girl in the hallway and ask her to sleep with me, she also refuses. I know that I am dreaming and in theory I can change the dream to make them sleep with me or coerce them too, but I know that would be wrong so I leave it alone. I'm not sure exactly why I was having these sexual tendencies towards my friend in my dream, it seems odd now, but while I was lucid I remember telling myself that even though im not attracted to her in real life it doesn't mean we cant have sex in a dream. I stayed lucid for a while more and went to a class and in it was my mom and someone who I stopped being friends with long ago. The ex friend berrated me for not being friends with him anymore and my mom told me she was worried about why we werent friends anymore. I explained the situation and she agreed with me. At this point my memory of the dream kind of skips and goes to me getting off the elevator and these are robbers of some sort and they were shooting people in the lobby of the building. There was shattered glass and pools of blood all over the floor and I was crawling around over it to make it towards the exit. The robbers were steaming and smashing glass and shooting. I remember having lucid controls of which path to take and when to move so that bad guys wouldnt see me. But, the paths felt predetermined like I could go this way or that way like a video game. I have only ever been fully lucid once before, and this time felt even more lucid and aware than my first time. Ques dont usually work for me, I can hear them but they never cause me to realize im dreaming. I was wondering if letting go of some of my "uptightness" and letting the music move me at the concert could have gotten my mind into a better place for LD's. Usually I am pretty reserved so dancing in a crowd of people was definitely not the norm for me. So like letting go helped put me in a free'er mental state.Im personally a little weirded out by me coming on to my friend in my dream and going so far as asking for sexual favors. That is totally out of character for me. Maybe because I knew it was a dream I wasn't worried about real life implications? Just my experience this time, I'm hoping to continue my LD quest and have more!

1vpzkb	-55770	1390266397	nutrition	College food consistently makes me sick?	I just got back from winter break during college, and the same disturbing pattern is occurring once again. Just like when I started eating the schools food last fall, I become sick feeling quickly after consuming it. Usually about halfway through the meal I start to get a headache in the back of my head, and by the time I am done usually pretty much my whole head is aching. Shortly after he headache my stomach starts hurting badly and I start to feel nauseated. When it started happening last semester I sort of wrote it off as me being paranoid or something along those lines. But with it coming back a second time and the only real dietary change being eating the schools food, in conjunction with the tiing of right after or during my school meals, I'm starting to think I might not just be paranoid. This primarily happens with the fried foods, chicken tenders and fries, bu also the hamburgers too sometimes. I do have a lot of allergies, but i'm not sure if they are a factor with this because I do not get my regular symptoms of a reaction.I'm just curious if anyone has experienced something similar, might know what is going on or has any ideas to cope? I hope /r/nutrition was an appropriate place to post this.

2ptljw	-55789	1419022084	tifu	TIFU by having a visible hard on in front of blind dates sister	So this happened last night...and before I get flamed I ended up coming out on top.Went on a date with a girl I met off a dating site last night. Lets call her Sandy. First time meeting Sandy in person. We went out for dinner and drinks, &amp; clicked pretty well. At end of night I ask if she needs to get home and she said "well yeah we could go hang out at my place for awhile". I smiled and peeled out of the parking lot we were in.So we get there and Sandy said her sister was going to stop over to get something in a little while (It's like midnight by this time). We start making out a little bit on the couch, things get a little heavier and I asked if her sis was still coming over and she said I dont know. She ends up sitting on my lap making out with me grinding on my denim cock. Then the buzzer rings and she pops up giggling, turns the lights on and she goes over and lets her sister in the apartment...My button up shirt is unbuttoned to my nips, hair is a little messy and I am leaning forward to help mask the giant (for me) hard on I have that is very visible even with jeans on. Sister and I make awkward eye contact she is on her phone when she comes in and then Sandy threw me a pillow to help out. Sister is there for awhile and the tent is eventually taken down as I cooled down. After everything is back to normal Sandy laughed about it and eventually I got head. For a not so smooth ladies man pretty good first date. Plus, if it doesnt work out with Sandy, her sis knows what I am working with.

"While I know it is unfair for me to ask you this because of your RL commitments, but how would you feel about returning, negotiating a BNI share transfer from Lychton to yourself, and taking the reins of BNI once again? The alliance, Brave Collective, is no longer in line with the principles on which Brave Newbies Inc. was founded and I think it would be a good idea if you were to return, remove BNI and reform a new alliance that is free from the likes of Anna and his conspirators. Those corps that wish to remain in Brave Collective can stay and find out just exactly where Anna is leading them to."

With that, I have just one question.  How in the world do I install my OS without an optical drive?  I've watched videos that explain it, but it just doesn't make sense to me.  Is there a video out there that really breaks down the whole process?  I'm also wondering how I will install the driver to my WiFi adapter.  Will an Ethernet connection work once I get my OS installed?  This is my first build guys, and I completely understand the whole build process and am knowledgable of the different parts, just these last steps worry me.  Your feedback helps.

2ipteb	-55812	1412816426	DIY	Toilet flange messed up	I decided to replace a toilet that was fairly old. When I pulled the toilet up I also pulled the white double spaced and black funnel cone thing up with it. This caused the flange to be too low. I had a friend come out who is a handy man and he mentioned the flange was bent and there was nowhere to screw down for the new flange since the subfloor was cut too large? He explained that we would probably have to take out the tile and lay new subfloor or go from underneath which is a finished kitchen ceiling and replace subfloor. There is sub floor there but the hole for the flange was cut too large and I guess the bolts don't go into the subfloor? The toilet that was there previously didn't rock or do anything like that so it wasn't unstable. What are my options? I would really prefer not to have to take out tile and redo some subfloor as I would have to contract that out because I am not very handy.  Here is a picture. The black funnel thing and extenders are still in the picture but those are now gone. http://i62.tinypic.com/125gtia.jpg
2j2wrb	-55812	1413167319	HVAC	Gas boiler info	I just purchased a house that was built in 1986. The boiler looks to be original. I know that it is past its life time and am expecting to have to have it replaced in the next few years probably. The owner had it cleaned and tuned by a reputable hvac/plumbing company in May and they noted that that nothing was wrong with it. We haven't had to use it much, but it definitely heats the house. The house is 1450 sq feet, 3 zones. Basement, main floor, and upstairs. I know nothin about boilers and am looking at someone to just look at a few pictures to see if they notice anything odd or out of place with the set up. I also wouldn't mind a general quote on replacing it with a similar set up and a high efficiency set up. Location is in the New England area so prices are a little higher probably.

2jq2ha	-55812	1413753033	electrical	3 prong dryer outlet	I have a 3 prong dryer outlet and I would like to clarify a few things. I have read that if it is 3 prong it is not grounded and dangerous. The house was built in 1965 so it was up to code at that time. I would like to look at changing it to 4 prong or grounding the current 3 prong if possible. Is it possible to make the current 3 prong safe and ground it? Maybe by swapping out the outlet with a 4 prong and using the neutral as the ground?If not, am I correct that an electrician would have to run new wiring from the breaker to the new 4 prong outlet with a ground or just run a ground? The breaker box is in the same room and only like 6 feet away. I am not savvy so an electrician would be my main option to run new grounds/wiring. What would an appropriate cost of this be knowing that the breaker box is so close and should be a quick job? I'm in the north east if that helps. 
2laowr	-55812	1415133689	Tools	What drill/driver set should I get?	I'm in the market for a quality drill and impact driver. I am a novice DIY. Just bought a house and would like to tackle projects on my own and slowly learn some stuff. The drill and driver probably won't get used much but I would still like a quality pair. The most action they will see would probably be lag bolting the deck into the house as nails were just used. I also plan on tearing down all the old siding on the small shed and screwing down some new plywood and installing vinyl siding. Other than that.. These tools will be taken out for just normal maintenance things. I have it narrowed down to the following sets:http://m.homedepot.com/p/RIDGID-X4-18-Volt-Hyper-Lithium-Ion-Cordless-Drill-and-Impact-Driver-Combo-Kit-3-Tool-with-Radio-R9601/203810442/http://m.homedepot.com/p/DEWALT-20-Volt-Max-Lithium-Ion-Cordless-Combo-Kit-with-Tough-Case-2-Tool-DCKTS240C2/205467726/http://m.homedepot.com/p/Milwaukee-M18-18-Volt-Lithium-Ion-Cordless-Drill-Driver-Impact-Driver-Combo-Kit-2-Tool-2691-22/100650378/DeWalt and Milwaukee both have the 12 volt sets that I am sort of eyeing to be cheaper but I don't know how much less power those have when compared to the 18v. I figure just getting an 18v set is best just in case. For some reason I am leaning towards the Milwaukee but have a friend who swears by DeWalt. I'm hoping to grab these whenever they go on sale for Black Friday or Christmas.

2o2ce5	-55812	1417542992	DIY	Wiring light switch	Hi everyone. I am replacing outlets and light switches in my house as the previous owner painted over them all... Not sure why. I am replacing one light switch that has a ton of wires stuffed in the box. The weird thing with this switch is that it has two black wires connected to just one screwed terminal on the right side of the switch. I am assuming this is incorrect and you should never connect more than one wire to a screw terminal? This light switch powers the top half of an outlet. At some point the owner had a ceiling fan installed so I am also assuming they ran power from the light switch to the fan... This would account for the massive amount of wires in this outlet box. The light switch does not power the fan/light. (Wish it did)Anyways... Is it bad to have two hot wires stacked on top of each other connected to one terminal on a switch?
2qibhf	-55812	1419657431	DIY	Lag screws for deck	The house I just bought has a fairly small deck attached to the house with nails. The inspector mentioned that I should secure it with lag bolts or lag screws. The deck is probably 8x8 in size. The inspector did say the person who built it used flashing behind the ledger board so I guess that's good. I would like to secure it better using fasten master ledgerlok lag screws that are 3 and 5/8 in length. Are those long enough? I read that I should stagger to help lower the risk of splitting the ledger board. I guess I am just concerned about screwing long screws into the side of my house. Should I be worried about hitting something behind the ledger board or creating holes for water to seep thru the holes where the lag screws are?

32iguw	-55812	1428975122	HomeImprovement	Help with shed	I purchased a house last August and the little shed that is there is not in the best of shape. The structure looks good on the inside but it needs to be reshingled, a new door needs to be built or out in and the ramp going up to it needs to be rebuilt. The biggest issue is the foundation its on. It's definitely leaning and the previous owner kept adding bricks to help stabilize it. So far my options are to:jack it up and move it back and level out the ground and properly set it in place with foundation bricks. Fix up the roof and build a new door etc. Buy a prebuilt shed for around $1500 (my diy skills definitely can't build one from scratch) and then level out the foundation area so it's proper. The shed is really small, just enough room for a lawn mower and small snow blower and basic garden tools and a few bucks/sand/salt. The yard area is really odd so I would have to get some dirt and fill up some space to move the shed back and make it flat. See the pictures.

I'm thinking that it will keep breaking further and further off. During the winter snow will pile up a few feet on the edge so I'm sure that adds a lot of weight on it. My thoughts would be to dig s trench along the edge and line with gravel and cinder blocks to create a 2 foot wall or so and then patch the edges.

34zniw	-55812	1430862929	landscaping	New home owner, trying to get yard into shape.	Hi guys I hope someone can point me in the right direction. I just purchased a house last September and now that winter is over I can begin working on my lawn. I'm in the New England region and get tons of snow in the winter and nice hot sunny days in the summer. My backyard is a mix of grass, moss and weeds. The moss seems to account for 80% of everything. Our back yard has a huge tree that provides a large amount of shade along with a small shed that provides shade on the far back of the grass area. Our backyard is also on quite a large slope that makes it difficult to mow the lawn on especially when it's practically all moss. What can we do? I have thought about renting a power rake or even a sod cutter. I was thinking our lawn was so mossy that it would be best to just remove the moss and grass completely with the sod cutter and then rototill the dirt and start from scratch but I was looking at some Scott's moss control stuff that says it kills moss and then helps the grass grow. That product has good reviews but I wonder if it makes sense as most the lawn is moss anyway and it will die and just need to be raked up. There's also a few clover patches and weeds in the grass. I ideally would love to have a nice green, easy to maintain grassy lawn. Linked is an album of my problems. http://imgur.com/a/FWDzKThank you for any input. 
37gprc	-55812	1432737359	lawncare	Redoing grass lawn	My lawn consists of lots of moss from the previous owner not taking care of the trees and leaving lots of shade and not overseeing yearly. The grass is growing into the moss and not rooting into the dirt.Can I just till the existing moss and grass into the dirt and lay a layer of top soil and plant new seed? Or do I need to kill the moss and grass, rake it all up and then till and seed?I'm being told by family that tilling the existing stuff will just die under the soil and won't be an issue. I'm having the trees in our yard trimmed a lot and opened up to allow more sun so moss in the future shouldn't be an issue like it is now.

There's no cracks there inside/outside foundation but the water sheds off the roof and drips down onto the deck down to a gravel pad under the deck which wicks to the foundation. I am thinking a gutter would fix this issue. How would I install one up there as the soffit layout is kind of weird? Same thing for the down spouts? Also, what tools would I need to DIY this? I have a drill and impact driver. Speciality gutter tools?Thankshttp://imgur.com/q85x0ojhttp://imgur.com/HtgZBrghttp://imgur.com/pKGz2H3
3hgsek	-55812	1439916598	HomeImprovement	Mold in basement?	My basement has a halfway finished laundry room that has a concrete floor with a wood hatch leading to a plumbing clean out under it. We laid a piece of plywood on top to span the room to level out where the washer and dryer will go. Recently i got a dehumidifier because it was kinda smelly down there.. More than Normal. That immediately fixed that issue and now we run it every few days. There's no visual water leaks but I just noticed there some surface mold growing on the top of the plywood piece I put down. I am going to pull that up and get rid of it. My biggest concern is that the surface mold is NOT from standing water and must be from the higher humidity as we have lived here for almost a year without a dehumidifier. What are the chances that there is surface mold behind the drywall? 
3hsumu	-55812	1440125197	HomeImprovement	Lubricate windows?	A few of my windows are fairly hard to raise and lower. They are all Marvin Integrity double hung windows. Wood finish on the inside and clad on the outside? I think they are the ultrex line up but I am not positive. I looked at the Marvin manuals online and I couldn't find anything about lubricating their double hung windows. I have a can of silicone lubricant spray, would this be okay to spray inside the tracks or should I use something else?The previous owner has painted the inside wood finish white as well. She did a horrible job on some and got white latex paint on the inside edges which seem to be plastic? The factory finish on the plastic edges are off white. Is it safe to paint that with regular latex semi gloss or gloss paint to make it match the trim and tidy it up?

29enwb	-55854	1404064866	relationship_advice	Overthinking or naw?	My fiance and I have been together for three years. A lot of things have changed throughout our relationship ie; graduated college, started actual careers, have other priorities besides smoking weed, etc etc. Through out it all despite our lack of common interests, we have always been best friends with such a deep bond and unconditional support and love. The issue now is that since we got engaged (4 moths ago) and he changed his career path, he almost seems as if he was bored/uninterested. For example; doesn't want to go out, try new things, spend time together. Honestly, he's kind of being a stick in  the mud. I have cooked dinner for him, planned romantic nights, played magic the gathering with him, played video games, given him space, nothing really seems to make him happy. I'm a pretty secure person and the thought of him cheating isn't really something I have nor want to entertain. I've pretty much just summed it up to him being stressed with so much new things going on. The thing is if I ever bring up that he seems unhappy he snaps. He instantly says nothings wrong, that he's happy and gets frustrated at me. I don't want to beat a dead horse but I also don't want to feel alone in our relationship. How do I try to be supportive/understand what his deal is without being nagging? He gets laid plenty, so thats not the issue people...

2eneci	-55856	1409077565	furry	I REALLY wanna get into drawing.. Does anyone want their fursona drawn for free?	Okay so, I have very VERY little experience drawing (Especially bodies), and I don't wanna draw anything directly from a video game or from a cartoon and such.. So for practice, I thought "Hey, why not draw people's fursonas for free?". I'm not guaranteeing any omega beautiful shiny sparkly art that artists like Falvie or Fluff-Kevlar do (Don't expect anything close :p), I just wanna practice a bit. I mainly wanna practice on heads first, but I'll draw the body too if I'm feeling confident enough :P.EDIT: If you do want one drawn for you, I don't know exactly when they will be done and how long each will take. So please be patient!ANOTHER EDIT: I'll start by drawing your character's face (Like for a profile picture). I'll move onto the body if I get the time.YET ANOTHER EDIT: After playing around with MydasThrown's character Sashimi both with pencil+paper then translating it to PaintTool SAI.. I've decided, I'll do some sketch only, play around with some both with a sketch and PaintTool SAI and experiment with how I go about drawing it. Also, some characters I might do a frontal view, a side view, or maybe a view from an angle.. Who knows? Maybe even the entire body. It will all come to if I'm up to the challenge or not at the time, but I really do wanna get to most of your fursonas!DEAR GOD HOW MANY EDITS: A couple of examples of side views I've done beforehttp://www.furaffinity.net/view/14377563/http://www.furaffinity.net/view/9036561/

Nothing has been able to make me cry. Not when my parents fight, not when I read or see something sad, even when my grandma died, I didn't even feel like I was about to cry. Don't get me wrong, I was crushed, but I couldn't cry. And this past week, probably the worst feeling week of my entire life, I felt like crying so hard, but I can't cry, and I really want to let it out other than typing about how I feel. Has anyone ever felt this? It's fucking horrible and I miss being able to cry.

I'll probably not draw your character without some sort of reference. Also, these drawings will most likely be headshots only, maybe a bit more or a full body shot if I'm feeling really adventurous.

The circle-pad feels great (but that's probably just because it's new.. either way, feels much better than the OG 3DS), same with the C-Stick.. the buttons and D-Pad feel incredible, and the actual plastic shell does not feel cheap at all. Does anyone feel this way about the N3DSXL? And, is the normal N3DS like this too?

I had that for about 3 years, then I upgraded to Windows 8 Pro, and installed 8.1 Pro right after that. Fast forward to today, I'm upgrading to Windows 10 (not through that MediaCreationTool thing or whatever, through the GWX.exe thingy that pops up in the bottom right corner, so, no fresh install). Liking it, but wanting to try out Minecraft.. but I can't. I Google the problem and apparently I'm not activated.After being on the line with tech support for like an hour, apparently the ONLY way to fix this is to do a completely fresh Windows 8 install with the same product key and upgrade to Windows 10 again. Is this HONESTLY the only way to fix it?

Okay so, just today, the start menu stopped working so I thought "I'll just restart explorer.exe". nope. It was frozen, so I restarted my computer. I got a message after logging on saying something like "Critical Error: Start menu and Cortana aren't working. We'll try fixing it next time you log on". So I was like, sure. Tried relogging, same thing. I tried that SFC command in the CMD but it said no issues were found.I found a really quick fix online, the person said to reboot into safemode, log on, then relog into normal mode. That worked.. for a few minutes. Start menu still doesn't work, notifications doesn't work, sound mixer doesn't work. Now, in an attempt to load up the settings app, I went onto my desktop, right clicked and clicked Display and I'm met with "ms-settings:display --- This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action. Please install a program or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default Programs control panel". So my settings app is missing now too?Is there ANYTHING I can do to fix this WITHOUT doing a fresh install? I've done way too many fresh installs on things to be wanting to set up ANOTHER computer.EDIT: Restarted and it works fine now, but still, advice would be great just in case it happens again.Thanks for taking your time to help!

drro1	-55860	1287171063	politics	Rank the top ten preeminent politic issues of the day in order of most important to least important-- Your opinion.	It seems like sometimes we get caught up in the small details. 1.  Address the military-industrial complex in the United States and dramatically reduce military spending.  End imperialistic foreign policy.2. Ensure, one way or another, that every American has complete basic health-care coverage for free.3.  Enact some sort of campaign finance reform that involves dramatically reducing the ability of large corporations to influence political decision making.4.  Eliminate corporate welfare, corporate subsidies, and corporate tax loopholes.  Especially end corn subsidies.5.  Start to work towards powering America completely with nuclear energy.6.  Grant citizenship to all illegal immigrants, and then completely close off the border.  It will be impossible to increase the standard of living within the country if people are able to keep coming in from outside.  While it would be nice to increase the standard of living of the whole world, that is simply not feasible.7.  Completely end the whole War on Drugs.  Dramatically reduce the number of people in prison for non-violent offenses, and reform the prison system so that criminals do not leave worse than they went in.8.  Reform elementary and high school education by some sort of European-style voucher system so that competition exists between schools.9.  Subsidize healthy foods for the poor.  This means rice, beans, lentils, spinach, tortillas, grass-fed beef, free-range chicken, organic eggs and milk.  Tax soda, high fructose corn syrup, fast food, and cigarettes.  A healthy populace means a dramatic reduction in health care costs.10.  Reduce suburban city planning.  Design cities with houses and stores closely intermingled, to encourage walking and community.

Please correct me if i am wrong, but i was always taught (in ccd) that before Jesus man was not able to enter heaven because he had sin. To fix this, god sent his only begotten son down to earth to die on the cross. The act of dying on the cross absolved man of his sins and gave us the ability to enter heaven. It always seemed odd to me that god had to find a loophole to get us access. Wouldn't that mean he's being forced to play by someone else's rules?

doudz	-55889	1286593411	atheism	Question of faith?	If you break it down, the concept of faith in a religious context is a little crazy. In most cases, if you have faith; you're saying "based on my knowledge of  X I think Y is a possible outcome." If someone is a slacker, but you know they're very smart, you may have faith that they'll pass their finals. But if a 10th grade D student took the BAR exam, to have faith that they'd pass is to ignore everything you know about logic and common sense and believe the least probable outcome will occur, for the sole reason that you believe it. So, in the context of organized religion, you're basically saying that you find it easier to believe the miracles of the bible, than it is to believe that it's authors (who were human) we're dishonest or not completely sane. I am not sure if Occam would agree.Please reply if you disagree.

I'm new to this jaibreak thing and simply uninstal an item after my phone crashes and comes back in "safe mode". However, both times I tried to install springtomize, it would work for a while and then cause my phone to literally be stuck at the apple logo boot screen or while any app is loading it would just freeze. To reboot, I would actually open the phone, disconnect the power source, give it a min, hook'er back up and turn'er on. Also, I've noticed that my iTunes player on my phone, in addition to the actually phone call app are both malfunctioning and are very temperamental since the jailbreak. For example, I got rid of auxo because it caused my volume to disappear at times. And the phone app, I have no idea what causes it to not work properly. But the problem I continue to get is the the button that switches from key pad to the options block(Speaker, mute, etc..) does not work anymore. I have to hit the home button while in a call and then tap the green bar at the top to bring the phone app back up, then and only then can I switch between the Key Pad and Options block. But only once! lolI'm running a 4 on 6.0.1Does anyone have any advice for me?

1dgqv5	-55890	1367384593	jailbreak	I cleared nearly three gigs of space on my iPhone, and you can too!!! Here's how..	While rippin through my phone using iFile, I noticed a folder that was a cache of pics from texting. That seems about right.  However, some of these were pics from threads I had deleted long, long ago. So I took some time, about three hours, to go through the entire folder and determine what I wanted to keep and what I wanted to delete. In the end, I cleared 2.8 Gigs of cached pics. Apparently I text pics back and forth often. Go to folder /Var/Mobile/Library/SMS/. Inside there, you'll find folders labelled Attachments, Drafts and Parts. Attachments has all the cache of pics you've ever sent or received in a text. Once you delete the file out of attachments, you likely wont see too many in the Parts folder. Don't worry about deleting the entire folder either, it's ok to do so. If you send or receive another pic, or any other media file, your phone will simply create another folder in /Var/Mobile/Library/SMS/. Hope this helps!!  Edit: I'm rockin an iPhone 4 on iOS 6.1.2 and Cydia 1.1.8  EDIT 2: I HAVE A THEORY AS WELL. If you restore your phone to an old restore point, say from a couple years ago, jailbroke it again and went into the same folder (/Var/Mobile/Library/SMS/), you might find even older pics. But it's just a theory. I may try it one day and when I do, I'll be sure to give a heads up    EDIT 3: Looks like I just cleared another ton of space without any adverse effects. About another Gig in fact. I found just over 2,000 files at anywhere from 3Kb to 12Kb in the imageCache folder, located in /var/mobile/Library/Caches/imageCache. I looked at around 50 of these files and they all seem to be images cached from the appstore, itunes, etc..  Deleted em all, emptied the trash, no adverse effects, more space!!

See [here](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-12-06/diesel-shortage-fears-aired/4412644)Was told by one of my colleagues that he had spent the afternoon trying to find diesel in Bendigo, was told there was a state-wide shortage for the next couple of weeks.Another colleague did the same, was told there'd be no diesel in Bendigo at all by closing tonight.As our company has a fleet of about 10-12 diesel cars &amp; vans this will make things interesting if this is true.
1m11ap	-55903	1378728332	C25K	Calf pain after w4d3?	Just finished Week 4 Day 3, I had to ice my right calf as it was hurting a little more than usual.  After day 2 (2 days ago) it hurt a little more but during tonight jog it got  progressively worse. I'm guessing it's shinsplints, I already jog with some 'corrective' shoes and insoles as the first time I tried jogging years ago it flared up bad (like hobbling bad). It flared up again at the start (w1d1) but after a rest and a fresh start it has been good up till now.I'd like to try barefoot jogging, I just realised tonight there is a cricket oval near me I can use to run laps so might give that.a go.Any thoughts/warnings/alarm bells ringing for you folks here? At this stage I am going to give my leg a rest for an extra day, I've been pushing pretty hard the last couple of weeks so I'm thinking a rest before tackling week 5 is in order. That 20 minute jog is daunting, very daunting ... a huge mental barrier! I know I will be able to do it though because I broke through Week  4 Day 1 without any trouble at all. It was a huge mental barrier to me, going from 9 mins total jogging to 16. Queen got me through that day ... Freddie Mercury ... only man I would go gay for and he's dead!

1o21w6	-55903	1381318881	C25K	I could use a hug. First time I've had to stop in a run; someone tried to run me over; and to top it off the app crashed and lost all my good work. W7D1	Yeah so I have come down with some sort infection, I have been coughing up disgusting things all day but thought I'll go for a run anyway and see how I go. (First 25 min run)About the 20 min mark started getting a stitch really bad and just had to stop and walk it off for a bit. Thankfully it was gone after that but then right at the end of my run I'm running on the wrong side of the road, on the road shoulder, I see this car coming towards me.It starts slowing down, so I think oh, its going to turn into my street. Nope, no indicator. Rolling my eyes at lack of indicator ... then I notice hey, that car is coming directly at me ... WHAT. THE. FUCK.I think if I wasn't so sick and right at the end of (for me so far) a tough 25 min jog I might have responded differently. I just flipped him off and jumped out of the way, the car just sped off after that, I didn't hear anything after that.And to top it all off the app crashed and lost all the log for the run, so I guess I will just repeat W7D1. Really after all that I think it deserves a do-over.My wife tried to cheer me up by suggesting maybe it was some hot women who wanted to get my number.No. No it certainly wasn't.

I've been buying and trading for a week or so now, and it was going well. I've run into a block though. I play magic with my dad. He is my main practice partner and we have fun with it. But he absolutely refuses to support my quest for a modern deck. He's even gone as far as telling me "it's just plain retarded." I don't know what his problem is. He does this every time I try to build a non-standard deck. It really infuriates me, because if I ever try to shoot down one of his ideas, he starts yelling at me and has quit playying with me for weeks at a time before, just because I thought the deck he was building wasn't viable. I don't really know if this is the right place to post this, but how should I get him to at least be neutral twords the building of my modern deck?Thanks!(Sorry for any misspellings or formatting issues.

I usually get hit with the explosion from the bomb while sliding in.  Thanks!

I know you need to do a ridiculously fast half circle on the bottom half of the controller, but where to go from there? I can get Falcon to do the point where he will kinda kill his momentum and drift back a little, but then he just turns around. Do I need to do the circle motion again? Or do I just need to be faster? Moonwalking as a concept is very confusing to me. Also, why does this even work? What in the engine allows you to run backwards?

My ADC is constantly yelling at me to stay with them in lane, almost to the point of babysitting. I tell the ADC he needs the solo farm, but he refuses to accept it. Supports are not supposed to sit in duo for the entire game are they? When I watch SPL games, the support spends 90% of their time in mid.Also, I find myself behind the other support most games, despite having the same KDA. Is it because the other support isn't rotating, and getting steady xp from duo lane(I only play casual conquest, so you can't expect too much out of the opponent)?Thank you!
f7kxk	-55920	1295804421	sports	What Is Freebording?	Freebording was created when an enthusiastic bunch of snowboarders decided that they just couldn’t wait for the white stuff to get their ride on. Essentially the Freebord is a skateboard with wider trucks but the addition of a fifth and sixth wheel (which rotate 360 degrees) in the center section of the deck is really what makes this machine so extreme.

Essentially, Strand wanted to combine the grace and ease of lateral movement (or “sliding”) that snowboarding allows with the year-round fun of skateboarding.  He knew that if he could recreate the motion boarders loved on the slopes without the snow that he would have something spectacular.

2sx5kg	-55928	1421659120	RATS	Thinking of switching from female?	So I've had female rats for about 6 years now, starting with my first lady, adopted at around 1 year old. (Males before that but QUITE awhile ago) When we adopter her she came in a 1'x1'x1' cage. We couldn't immediately get her a new one so we just left the door open to roam. She basically became a shoulder rat and even after getting her a mate and a large cage, she always got excited to run up my arm and cuddle. None of my others since have been so cuddly. Don't get me wrong! The ladies have been active (sometimes too active) explores and get excited to come sniff and jump around. But the male rats I used to have as (kind of a kid) definitely were more. Was she so bonded because she didn't grow up with a pack? Happy to sleep in a hoodie because she never had space?And as for the cuddlyness or my old males: Is this fond misremembering of younger memories? I know they are typically different energy wise but is the difference  really that big?

I was told to go here and I read the FAQ and such and have a few more. I have no debt of any kind and I want to keep 15K as an emergency fund and invest the other 25.1. Regarding IRA. Traditional vs Roth. I make 50k a year but im am studying to get certs which will hopefully get me a better job and more pay. In the FAQ it says to choose traditional vs roth depending on what tax bracket you expect to be when you retire. I am most likely going to be making 50-70k for next few years but expect to be making almost 6figures by 30Y/O. which do I choose or what do I have to consider?2. Providers.

2vd9cm	-55936	1423531950	paintball	Guide to visiting PSP	SO if you are going to the PSP to watch and not to play here is what you do.If you live locally and are going to be at the psp for all 3 days do the following. Either follow PBnation or contact the pro teams that are going to be competing and find out if they need a pit crew. I am telling you they will. It will cost you $50 to buy an appa badge to be allowed into the back/pits area. You will fill/clean pods and guns. Pick up pods on the field between points.In return you will get to see how pros play from 15 feet away. You can learn ALOT. Can take a picture or autograph if that's your thing but the BEST part of pitting for a pro team is the paint. They don't reuse paint that has been opened so they give it to their pit crew for helping. It is ALOT of paint. I was pitting for Dynasty in 2013 at Riverside with 2 other friends. I think we walked away with 5.5 cases each and even gave the guy who let us crash at his house another 4 cases. Steps:1.Live locally and be available all 3 days.(Don't flake on the teams and only show up to 1 game. That's not cool)2. Contact your favorite teams and ask if they need a pit crew. (Contact a team you think will make it to Sunday. So either being relegated or playing in finals so more games=more paint for you)3. Pay $50 for the card and have a blast. Everything will be explained to you at the event and you don't need to know shit. 4. The Secret to AS MUCH PAINT AS POSSIBLE(So they don't use paint that is opened. SO your goal as the pit guy is to fill as many pods as possible. Every pod you can find. Whoever is picking up pods on the field make sure he is stealing the other teams pods too so that you have more to fill and so after the game there are more to empty and more paint to take home. EnjoyYou also get to walk around in between the field and if you are pitting for a pro team you get to go in the back pro area and watch them. Super cool and always a blastAny Qs just ask

w8pns	-55942	1341789610	cats	Trying to socialize my cat	So I adopted my cat when she was four months old, and she's been with us a year now.She was incredibly skittish when we first got her and she's come a long way from there and is really good around humans, but being an indoor cat she's never met another cat.I wanted to try to introduce her to my good friend's cat, but it went imo pretty badly.  Both cats went totally hiss and fangs at each other and I've never seen my cat even hiss before (I assume because she's never felt threatened).Eventually I do want to get a second cat, so I was looking for suggestions on how to slowly get my cat used to other cats, or to help her feel more comfortable in that type of situation.My SO says they need to just fight it out and then they will be all good, but I don't know if I'm super comfortable with that :s

I am primarily using a bong, and I am finding that I am not getting very high.  I know its fairly common for people to not really feel it their first few times, but it has been a good 15+ times for me, and I have never gotten too much of a high, and it does not last long.Yes, I am inhaling deep.  Yes, I am lighting the bowl long enough.Any suggestions?

15rzo9	-55942	1357061243	Anxiety	[help/rant] Having a big anxiety attack	My SO (who lives with me) is visiting his family out west until Saturday night.  I just got back to our shared apartment yesterday evening from spending the holidays with my family (during which I had some anxiety attacks).  Everything is shut down today and I've been out of my routine for a week and a half now which triggers my anxiety.  Being alone in my apartment is really hitting me right now, and the anxiety is just building.  I have some plans this afternoon and this evening to try to keep busy and I go back to my lab (I'm a graduate student) tomorrow.  Today until Thursday will probably be the hardest.  Friday evening my room mate comes back, but until then I am all on my own and that is very hard for me.I often have anxiety attacks when with my SO or my family, but I guess in that case I feel like at least there is someone there to talk to and to comfort me, whereas when I'm alone I feel like it's never going to end.Being female, of course it is also my time of the month so I'm more anxious than normal as well.Just looking for some comfort, and maybe some suggestions of things to do to keep me occupied for the next few days.Thanks for listening.

1b09m3	-55942	1364254838	cats	Advice about my cats roughhousing?	I adopted a three month old kitten as a companion for my cat back in late October.They have been besties ever since.  My older cat Yang is almost 2 years old, and my younger guy Merlot is now 8 months.I've started seeing what appear to be fight wounds around the back of Yang's neck.  At first there were only a few occasionally so I assumed it was her scratching or something - but I'm pretty convinced that Merlot is doing it.They play a lot (they are both full of energy) and whenever I've seen them, it seems to be playful and not mean spirited.  They both seem to actively invite the other to attack and they like chasing each other.  It could be that merlot is stronger now than he was when they first met, but I am not sure how to go about teaching him it's wrong.  I'm worried for Yang, she's got a lot of marks/wounds around her neck.  I've never seen her complain about them, or complain or act aggressively during wrestling.Help? Advice? Experience?

I am very excited about it, but I'm also scared/worried about how I will cope.  I tend to have a hard time travelling.I find that I am super anxious the night before I leave, I keep it under control during the flight etc.  But then when I get to our destination (our room on the cruise ship in this example) I absolutely lose it.  I feel so overwhelmed and everything is unfamiliar.I feel bad for the first two days usually, until I settle down a bit, and get comfortable in the new environment.  Anyone have any good techniques for dealing with those first few days?  Would be much appreciated

I have two, they are both indoor and they are both under the age of 2.The cheapest plan I have seen is $10/month per cat, and I have seen many that are MUCH MUCH more expensive.I am wondering if it is worth it?  I want to be protected, but I'm just not sure.  Especially because most plans have $150-250 deductible before the coverage kicks in, plus the $120 minimum per year in the monthly cost, I have spent $350 before the insurance kicks in.Opinions?  Suggestions for good insurance companies?  Experience?  I am in Canada if that changes things.

1mzga3	-55942	1379969674	waterloo	Crime near the bike path between albert mccormick arena and the albert plaza	The forested area to the right of the walking/bike path is cordoned off with police tape.  I went past twice between 4 and 4:30 (running errands).  There was a police dog, and an officer in a van was telling two teenagers who were asking that it was some sort of dog trained to find specific things.  There were 4 police cars positioned around the edges of the area, and a large police van with a woman who appeared to be a crime tech, in one of those white coverall suits sitting in the open van door.The gossip in the plaza was that there was a scream at around 2 pm, and then the police showed up.There appears to be an abandoned (with open doors) blue hatch back car right on the road in the police cordon.Does anyone have anymore information?

2blji7	-55942	1406213086	cats	Looking for some guidance for living with a FeLV + cat	Unfortunately we lost one of our cats, Yang about a month ago now, due to a very sudden onset of FeLV.  We just had our other cat, Merlot, tested yesterday and he has it as well.  These were my first two cats, and I wasn't educated enough on FeLV and never thought to test for it before bringing the second cat in to our house.  Merlot is a happy healthy guy at the moment, which is what I am trying to focus on, but I am looking for anyone else who has had a FeLV (+) cat, and might be willing to share their story.  I feel like I am going to always be worrying about him, and checking up on him multiple times a day.  How do you get past that?  Did you do anything on a day to day basis to help their health?  I am considering looking in to probiotics (might help prevent secondary infections?).  The stats are not very positive, but we are trying to enjoy the time we have left with him.  My biggest problem is that I almost feel like I am starting to mourn him now, but he's still here!  I don't want to feel like crying everyday  :(Any stories/suggestions/support would be much appreciated guys.
2fgt6j	-55942	1409848421	Anxiety	Just looking for support through my detox from mirtazipine (remeron)	I was on 7.5 mg a day, plus 90 mg of cymbalta a day.  The mirtazipine has made me gain soooo much weight, so after some good therapy break throughs and discussion with my doctor, we decided I could come straight off of it, because it was such a low dose to begin with. I took my last dose last Monday (10 days ago), and was fine until Friday when everything became awful all at once.  Feverish, nausea, headaches, sleep issues, body ache and more.I was feeling better as of Sunday/Monday but now I feel like I'm back to square one as I am feeling awful again.  I barely slept last night despite taking melatonin and my anxiety is ramping up due to exhaustion/maybe some rebound effect from the withdrawal.Any suggestions for ways to ease some of the symptoms? Anyone else gone off of mirtazipine, how long did the withdrawal last? I'm hoping I've come through the worst of it, but it just feels so awful.

I was using a konjac sponge in the morning just with water.  This seemed to be helping!  I also used a glycolic acid peel (low concentration) every few days.  My skin got a bit better.  I've had a very stressful summer and we moved and I got out of routine and my skin got a bit worse.  I've changed some medication I am on and I think that also may have changed things for my skin as well.Right now I am doing:AMNeutrogena cleanserStridex padmoisturizerPMCleanserBenzaclin (new, from my doctor, combines clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide)I've been using the Benzaclin for two weeks and no peeling or dryness yet really.I just have SO many whiteheads and I am trying so hard not to pick, but picking is happening and everything just looks so so awful.

I can't see the messages on Facebook anymore, because I think he deleted his Account, but in my Facebook-App on my mobilephone i still CAN see the Messages. So here is the conversation we led.* I friended him some days ago on facebook and the profile sure DID look as if it was an "the real thing".BigVern: Hi thereMe: LoL, Hi! Its an Honor, Mr. President :)BigVern: HhahahaBigVern: bowsMe: uh.. can i do something, can i fetch you something?Bigvern: lolBigvern: Are you a moderate cryptsy user?Me: not even that, I'm invested moderatly as well. I bought one share and Jesus knows I would buy more if I had more money.Me: you know over at cryptostocksBigVern: yaBigVern: we actually have a project investor group I wanted to invite you into if you intend on holding any coins.Me: how would I join, if i wanted to?Big Vern: it is to help get USD investors, by showing them solid volume of BTC investors, as right now we have speculative btc investors (traders)Big Vern: well here just read this lolBig Vern: I wanted to invite you as well since you have an interest in Bitcoin and perhaps also a Cryptsy user, We are getting temporary investors for the next four months starting today actually for a 10 % interest of whatever they guarantee to hold on a ledger. With project investors by linking your Cryptsy account to us, this provides us with backing to show USD investors that we have a secure "solid volume" investor base. As we are trying to start the USD exchange in the next 5 months. If for some reason we cant start it within 4 months you can always continue with the project investors 10 % until we do have enough USD investors to start the exchange.

Let's say, we're seeing some increased upwards-movement since the 21st of February. That's been 3 days now. Normal Pump-and-Dumps don't last that long.I'm really excited to see, ifA) The whole upwards-movement from 10 has been a Pump.B) Mint is going up but there is a Pump in there at some point that has not yet been resolved (dumped), or the really unthinkable,C) Its a heated upwards-movement but no dump in there.I sold 2/3 of my coins, to make back my initial investment, and I'll very gladly play the waiting game now to see where this is going. It looks very interesting.Edit: Seeing Mint at 44 after getting up, the decision to sell 2/3 of my mint for 26 seems a little premature in hindsight... as does not putting every money I have into this coin.

He already knew. That woman from MtGox (Some Sarah I think) who just yesterday said, that "your coins are secure" - They all lied.In Hindsight I wonder why there haven't been more protesters at the Mt.Gox Headquaters and I wonder why there isn't more rage. That bastard tried to single handedly kill Bitcoin, and while he cannot suceed with that he is for Bitcoin pretty much what Hitler was for germany. Minus the Holocaust, I give him that.The good thing is - I really started to think of him as fat, ugly incrustation on a plate in the dish washer that did not want to go away. But now finally it washed him away and maybe the plate is clean now. Cleaner in any case.God, I'm happy I had no Money in MtGox.

22i4g4	-55949	1396947919	MensRights	/r/mensrights needs to stop being afraid of being perceived as misogynist	If you haven't downvoted by now, please give me a minute to explain myself.I've come to think, that because r/theredpill exists and because of its really bad reputation, r/mensrights, wants to be as different as possible. Therefore some of us anticipate what might be PERCEIVED as misogynist.    And as we anticipate what people outside r/mensrights might think about a certain topic we want to be super-rational, super grown up, and super 100 % NOT misogynist. This takes out a lot of the necessary sharpness of our discussion. OF COURSE some will see us as being misognyist. Stop beeing afraid of that.Even if it is not really clear, wether a certain topic really IS misogynist or not, we still downvote each other, because we might look bad if we don't. And we want to be the good guys, not the red-pill guys. For example - If you joke about a woman, you almost certainly get your share of downvotes. Now I agree, that making puns about women does not help our cause, but please have a look at this situation from another angle!Women say, there should be no Rapejokes, because it makes it seem less serious and normal. That might be true. But it works the other way round too, and we see it happening in this very subreddit. If we don't allow any jokes about feminism, because this is not r/redpill and we are all so super rational and grown up, and totally not mysognyst, it makes the feminist cause looks way MORE serious then it is.And a "bad joke" is only the tip of the iceberg. Jokes are a no-go? Okay, then so be it. But then we have a topic, that is a little too hard on women - Downvotes. The "anticipation of being called out" reaches deep into r/mensrights. And i say, this slows us down and we're giving r/feminism a weapon against us.TL:DRBy anticipating to be called out as a misogynist and not to be mistaken for r/redpill we censor ourselves and try to be super-rational, thus letting feminism AND redpill indirectly influence us too much. We have to start being r/mensrights again and stop being "r/we-are-not-the-red-pill-we-promise-:-3".

2s9xwa	-55949	1421153093	Bitcoin	I know what it takes to turn the tides!	At this point we have no hope of ever seeing a rising Bitcoin again. That is because Bitcoin is dieing. Its core is dieing! It's dead at its core. Because all the bad news - and the good news - stopped "Bitcoins heart". It stopped beating.I'll try to put it in scientific terms. Imagine if Bitcoin was a huge thing. That thing is all that Bitcoin is, has been and ever could become. In the very center of it, there is the IDEA of Bitcoin. Bitcoin itself. And around there is a lot of shit that just flows there and keeps the whole thing going. Now if that shit - lets call it plasma - stops flowing, Bitcoin dies. That plasma is like the emotion of Bitcoin and the motivation and the hunger for being the currency number one. If that doesn't flow, then it's stuck. And that is bad. For all of us.And that is exactly what happend. All the stuff that happened in 2014, that and looking at ugly Mark Karpeles taking of with millions of Bitcoin shocked the shit out of Bitcoin and its heart - the plasma - stopped flowing.Bad news is: If we don't do anything, that is it. Bitcoin is dead. It's dieing NOW. Before our very eyes. It's like: NO, Bitcoin! Don't go! NO! Don't LEAVE ME! D'ONT LEAVE ME NOW. I can't be without you! Don't self-terminate! Don't go into the lava!!. And Bitcoin is like "Kill me, please kiiiill meeeeee."That is bad!Good news is: We CAN restart the Bitcoin-Heart. But we need to get to its core. That is not easy though. Because we can't go through the plasma. Because that plasma, like we have already established is rotten emotions, broken dreams and demotivation. Nobody can go through that. Not without help! Not without a plan!Here is the plan:We need to build a vehicle go get INTO the Bitcoin and down to its core. Once we are in the plasma, shit, stuff, we need to somehow get it going again, literally make Bitcoins heart beating again.We need nuclear weapons to do that. Powerful nuclear weapons. No Nagasaki-Firecracker-tier. Czar-Bomb-tier! And several of them. So basically, to explain it a little less scientific: We must go into Bitcoins backdoor, squeeze in, get to the plasma and blow up 20 - 30  60megaton nuclear warheads in a chain, you know, to get the Bitcoin juice flowing again.I can do this. But I need money. LOTS of money. So start tipping me now. Also I take applications. I can take some of you with me. But beware - I have only done this once before. Back in October 2013.So with a little hope and a few megaton bombs, we can save Bitcoin! We can SAVE it! You guys! We can save Bitcoin and, listen guys, we can SAVE the Bitcoin! It's not dead! We can do it!

Will I sell then?What if the Bitcoin makes it up to 10.000 Dollars? My BTC would be worth 28.530 Dollars. Now we're starting to talk about money! Will I be still on board?If Bitcoin reaches 30.000 Dollars. HOLY HELL. 85.490 Dollars!

Possible Partnership with /r/combatfootage	When this sub was created 6 Days ago from that other guy who made me mod because I asked him, nobody would have believed what a huge success this would be. Today we fondled (not crushed, that would not be safe) the 10-Member-Borderline and now EVERYTHING is safe and possible.I love everyone in here. You are GOOD people and better people than other people how are not in here. So we are the safest of the safest, because our Love means healing.But because we're slowly getting too big to fickety-fuckety-fuggy around, we need strategic partnerships with other compatible subreddits.For example: /r/combatfootage - They also need safe spaces. They see soo many people day, they need to be huggedAlso: /r/feminism and /r/fatpeoplehate - They also must feel the love we can give to them. We love women, Safe people (not fat - the thickness of thei bodies makes them EXTRA safe from fall damage) and cripples!Best thing that can happen to us is having safe crippled women in here!

That gif is the hottest shit ever. Of course! How clever they are! LiL' Kevin gets banned to the attic/voat because he's been a bad boy.Ghazi is unaware that the gif actually IS A GOOD REPRESENTATION OF WHAT IS GOING ON. Minus the shitty added text.WHY did they send Kevin to the attic? Because he's ridiculed by his older brother who - for no good reason - humiliates him at this christmas-singing thing. Then, because everybody of course he believes him, he talks his was out of it.Kevin feels helpless and starts a fight and - of course - is the bad boy and has to go to the attic.Kevins parents are like the gaming media who ONLY belive the SJWs (Kevins Older Brother) who just can't stop hitting on us for no reason, other then to have SOME justification for their shitty lives.Also: "I don't want to go to voat, there is noone to bitch too"Yah, if only that was true. Once we establish a nice community there, these fuckers will follow. I guarantee it. They aren't creative. They just leech of creative people.

3caffj	-55949	1436179988	KotakuInAction	Radical Feminist (of course against GamerGate) takes over biggest german Blog for ethics in Journalism	This is especially interesting for our german GGers, but it's also relevant for our international friends I guess.Bildblog.de is THE biggest german blog for ethics in Journalism. The blog was founded to dispute the many wrong/deceptive/sensationalist articles coming from the biggest german boulevard-newspaper the "Bild-Zeitung".In that blog they have a column "6 vor 9 (six before nine)" where they put up articles that they found wrong or which were bad journalism. So far it has been quite a balanced blog and uncovered many many lies from the german media.Well. The guy who made "6 vor 9" is gone and replaced by a feminist. And I think we can call her a radical feminist because - of course - the very first link that she posts is to [this](https://archive.is/FDiv4). She links to a person who goes on an on about how Gamergate is a Hategroup.And this new person herself? She has ALSO already written about GamerGate. In [this](http://imgur.com/9zWqkaM) article.So, maybe she'll try to stay balanced but I'm afraid that this blog that has been really awesome will be transformed into a vehicle for their radical fight.(Edit: First link is archived now, second link has been screencapped by /u/hansschmittfree. Thanks Hans! ;-) )

Hi!Whenever a woman is pro Gamergate or something else happens that goes completely against the Anti-GG narrative, they start spouting words which they think invalidate everything that has been said.Example: "Hi! I'm a Woman and I'm pro gamergate" Reaction: **Internalized Misogyny!** **BAM!**, **Brainwashing!** **BAM!**I'd like to know more of their **BAM!**-Words that they use like trump cards that they can just slam at the table whenever they feel like it.I guess "Sea Lion" is also such a trump card. Example: "Hey, honest question...." - **SEA LIONING!** **BAM!**Please help me find their Bam!-Words

What I want in a Space 4x game, and what I miss way too often, is the feeling of power.I want to feel powerful.Having a big fleet or many armies is not the end to this feeling. It's just the beginning.I want to know how many people are on my planets, how many people serve on my spaceships and stations. If I send my fleet into battle, and there are 100.000 People in there - or more - I want to KNOW that I send them into combat or maybe into death.I want lots of lots of decissions that I can make to influence the comon man (or creature)I want to feel the power over smaller planets. I want to go to planets that don't even know that I'm there. I want to go to planets where intelligence has not evolved. I want the possibility to mess with these creatures. I want to burry warmachines underground (like in the war of the worlds movie with Tom Cruise) and million years later I come back and suddenly awake themI want to fly to an enemy planet and nuke it from orbit, WITHOUT invading it (like it was possible in MooII but in no other gave ever since)I want to feel the POWER!
