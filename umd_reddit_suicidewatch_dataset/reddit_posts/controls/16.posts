It was a 'spinoff' of a mecha type show, where the main character was transferred to a highschool to guard a princess, whom was undercover (maybe?)it was mostly silly in tone, but had a couple of fight scenes and really great animation, I remember one episode had everyone going to a beach, and a rich crippled (?) kid kidnapped one of the girls and the hero of the story went to rescue her. sorry i dont have more info, its been a while but i was hoping you all could helpthanks!

1n90ef	-30008	1380292644	pettyrevenge	Bring Randos into our hotel room we payed for? Enjoy your trip!	**ok, first, sorry its so long, but you need the backstory:**so almost a decade ago i ran with a totally different crew of people, had a bunch of fun raving it up, doing the drug scene yada yada. one of our favorite events was DEMF (detroit electronic music festival). i had a buddy named "michael t. hogan" who was a cool guy, ladies man, and pretty funny. downside of MTH was he was younger than all of us, worked sporadically and lived with his folks. This meant he would rarely have money to chip into for things like hotel rooms. We liked him a lot so it wasn't a problem to just allow him a room card and let him stay with us, cause fuck it, its demf and we are all hanging out anyways. so one year we do it big. we all had good paying jobs, and detroit is cheap, and we have a killer hookup on the hallucinogens. take the bus there, get a 1 bedroom suite at the GM building overlooking the fest, worked out perfect for the 5 of us. MTH has a chicky from WI he's been trying to seal the deal with and she came separately with her group of friends so we knew and approved HER coming up with him...cause we kinda knew her through other friends, and who am i to tell him he can't get his dick wet?so this year, we brought up a fear and loathing kit...serious damage was to be done on our brain cells. MTH, wanting to be suave and look good decided he was going to forgo the harder stuff and just drink. mind you a drink cost like 5 bucks each, and he didn't chip in on the hotel...but whatever we all had money and its NBD, go get drunk...more for us right?day 1, no hitch, we all have fun and decide first thing in the AM we are breaking out the dropper and papers and gonna go nuts starting at 10am...fest opens at 12. MTH goes to meet up with chicky and have a few beers prior to the gates opening. we spend the first 3 hours on just a couple tabs each, and decide around 2 pm to go back up and redose to get us through the afternoon music and then come back for a nice 'dinner' later O_owe get to our room, and 6 girls are in our hotel, none of which we know and MTH is no where to be seen. being that we were a pretty tight group, and we had many felonies in our hotel &amp; not only was it not hidden beyond the desk drawer we were super pissed. one girl was peeing in the bathroom WITH THE DOOR OPEN as we walked in...serious WTF...MTH gets a phone call, and is up in the room in like 2 minutes. stated he just went down to the pop machine to get a few cokes, cause they are about to drink a bottle of rum. whatever dude, you left randos unattended in the den...never do such a thing! we let it all slide, cause again, we are in our world and don't want things to get too crazy and screw it all up for the rest of the day. after he and the randos leave, we hatch a ***devious plot***MTH has been bumming smokes from all of us, and we each had bought a carton, so he knows the gravy train will continue despite the rando incident. we decide, since the one girl is against doing the LSD, we would salt his game, dip the filter and put it in the pack upside down for easy fuckery. we are all supposed to meet up later in the day for a headlining event, and do so successfully. MTH is SHIT FACED. i mean like falling over, barely can hold his drink, eyes half closed DRUNK. he asks for a smoke...the plan is a go! we hand him the smoke with the extra surprise, he smokes it with relish. as smoking, an errant beach ball comes out of nowhere and hits him in the hand as he's taking a drag. the cig breaks with two drags to go, oh well damage is done! he throws it down and the girl with him **PICKS THE FUCKER UP**and says 'its still good...and takes a drag!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!well now our little plot just took an unexpected turn. so we had to sit them both down right then and there and cop to what we did. They both spend 5 minutes being pissed off at us. we remind them they were assholes for opening our room up to the general public, especially considering MTH was on a free ride. luckily the girl was cool with it, and they both enjoyed the ride with us the rest of the night...but there was a 10 second vision i had of going to jail in detroit and literally saw my future flashing away before my eyes. **TLDR** buddy brings random girls into our hotel room , we dose him and the girl he was with (accidently) at the music festival as payback...go read it, its funnyedit for formatting

1nwv2m	-30008	1381158181	electronic_cigarette	Just got a load of new flavors, will update my reviews upon tasting	so i just bought 5 flavors i haven't tried. i will update this post over the next few days, all flavors are from [vapor chef](http://www.thevaporchef.com)**EDIT TO ADD** not looking for karma off this post, but if you guys could stop downvoting it that would be great, just sharing my views on some stuff i bought, if you dont want to read it just close the window and dont be a lameFirst up, pina guavada; vaped on this yesterday while doing some stuff around the house. its sweet, but not overly. it reminds me very much of hobbes blood, but a little more citrus in the aftertaste...the pineapple flavor doesn't hit as hard as i would like, but its well blended with the guava/coconut notes so i forgive. i am sure if steeped it would be a little more intense, all in all i give it a 4/5Schmecto Schmooler: one of the rare flavors i did not care for. i had some of this on saturday night. it tasted more like fruit loops for one, second it sat in a tank overnight, and the next day tasted like fireworks. i even did a few puffs to run 'new' liquid through the wick and it still tasted kinda sour and offputting. probably staying away from this one moving forward - 2/5this morning is all about butter beer; its monday and i feel like a drink, but alas i must work in an office and for some reason that is frowned upon! :(  so its beer base is much more like a sweet beer, like a summer shandy or something similar. not very hoppy which is unfortunate, but i do like the butteryness of it, which is the predominate flavor. IMO this would be a great 'bar vape' to give you that beer taste while you drink a hard liquor to avoid excess calories, if thats one reason you vape like myself - 4/5afternoon: gave coolcumber melon a try. first menthol flavor ive vaped. it was surprising to me how light and airy the hit was. i like the fact that the melon is slightly more predominant than the cucumber flavor, but together with the menthol it is a very interesting and refreshing combo. i would certainly buy this one again and give it a 4/5

As if it didn't suck enough that my heads are failing, I can't find any place to buy them for less than five bucks a piece that had then in stock. Was there a recall or some shit?

PLEASE HELP	ok, so my wife and I have been playing GTA non stop for the past month. she liked it so much she bought her own console and copy of the game. I just showed her watch dogs and she really wants to give it a go. i am considering to pre-order the playstation pack with the extra gameplay and stuff. here is my question. does&gt; One-time license fee for downloads to up to 2 console systems that are associated with the purchasing account.mean i can install this game on BOTH our systems and she can play under her PSN account/system login or does it mean I can put it on two systems but i can only use ONE PSN log on/ System ID to access multiplayer?Any insight into this would be greatly appreciated.UPDATE: yes, you can put the game on two systems, which can have any player account on the system access the game both for single &amp; multiplayer. Also an fyi for those that dont know - PSN exclusive content isn't clearly listed on the PS store, but it will be available once downloaded.*sources: UBS &amp; PSN customer support lines

To bad I'm oblivious to anything but myself.	so i don't work in retail, but i am a user and thought this story fit well as I've been lurking this sub for the funnies quite a bit lately. so i am shopping at the local bulk store that pays its employees well and isn't owned by the waltons. typical sunday crowd, very busy. My wife &amp; I get our stuff, enjoy a few samples, buy some things we didn't plan on etc. at this point we go to queue up for the registers, the layout of my store is such that you can only fit 5-6 carts in line before the line for that register hits into the large pallets of snacks 30 feet away. there is ONE entry into this register area. naturally once the individual registers are filled up, the aisle starts getting blocked with people waiting to jump into an opening. enter EOW(entitled older woman) and her BD (bratty daughter). they both come up on the side of the line and attempt to get over to the registers, as if they are the only people who are smart enough to realize where the registers are located. EOW slips through without the cart, no one is letting BD through. finally she pipes up and says 'excuuuuse me, im trying to get in line over there'i am waiting right behind the person blocking her most, and say 'excuse me miss, not sure if you noticed the line of people waiting to do what you are trying to do right now, but the courteous thing to do is wait like the rest of us'she rolls her eyes and says 'whatever dude, its not a big deal'. my reply 'if its not a big deal, you should wait like everyone else and not be so entitled to think your time is more valuable'. the person ahead of me relents and lets her through and as she walks away i yell (antagonistic, i know) 'you should feel bad about yourself by making everyone else wait, hope you do'so i thought that was it. i get my chance to squeeze into a register line and lo and behold EOW &amp; BD are in line next to me! in front of us is KOD (kick ass older dude - must've been 80 something) &amp; his wife. EOW looks over at me as her daughter whispers something to her and, like an owl looks over at me while he head bobs 'DO WE HAVE A PROBLEM HERE?'I calmly look her in the eyes and say, 'yes, you have failed at teaching your daughter common courtesy and respect for others, as you set the example that cutting in line is OK. now your special little snowflake is learning her time is worth more than others, and she should be entitled to be first, even though we all were waiting and you just decided you would walk to a line and have your child push through despite the obvious'she gets enraged and starts asking who i think i am etc. i tell her i am am someone with better manners and obviously i learned from my parents how not to be a rude asshole to others in public, a lesson she must not have learned and is now failing to pass along to her spawn. she sputters and decides to be quiet after a few more back and forth comments. this is when KOD dropped the funny: "son, i think you said what we all thought and more...only other thing you can do to convince a woman like that is to beat her." his wife gives him that 'im shocked but your funny' look and he quickly explains to me how he would never actually beat a woman. i say 'neither would I, but as the comic says, i sure would shake the shit out of one' i don't think he heard that one before cause he cracked up as did his wife. while yes, it was a trivial thing to get upset about on my part, wtf? some people...

Call the store told they can't help but if I call at 8am custserv can. Basically am told the manufacturer never provided them and they will be sending to me via email ASAP. Soooo you didn't have that shit worked out in advance? Either ubi, GS or both fucked up hard. I now have a day off to play this game and I could get it anywhere from 5 minutes from now to 11pm tonight???Is this really the best they can do? Really?

28vj6r	-30008	1403534991	batman	Getting into the New 52 - questions for someone who has been out of collecting for decades	edit: title should say *FROM*ok, so i pretty much stopped collecting comics in the late ninties - really only liked supes and batman, but i have not really read anything for a while. I started working my way down the sidebar recs and had a few questions about the new 52.1. are there collected volumes? i know its been going on for some time but am unsure of this. I have been able to curate the flashpoint series but once that is done, is it then a matter of single issues?2. how many batman titles are there? should i read them all, or do the stories not cross over very much intra-title?3. is it WORTH reading the actual new 52, or is flashpoint enough?Thanks in advance for the info, please also suggest anything NOT in the sidebar that is bad to miss! I noticed Contagion wasn't part of it, and I just completed No Man's Land last week, if it is helpful to know.

This avoided us taking turns and getting butthurt about how long the other played - and also was a fun bonding experience where we could do something we both enjoyed together. we even bought her brother a copy, and plan to get my brother involved so we can all play together once he has a ps3. we have had a ton of fun, and met some really cool people from around the world and from reddit. never really had an issue - sure some griefers here and there, but its to be expected with so many people playing a violent game. usually we take it in stride and just continue to have fun.this brings us to last night. we are in a lobby just derping around, playing with my BIL GTAA &amp; rogen board crewmates. a couple of randoms in the lobby decided to hunt us with jets, and were dealt with in typical fashion when you have 6 players all connected vs them. my wife got done working, thought she should join cause it looked like fun (it was!) and literally *AS SOON AS SHES ON* some asshole starts to berate her for nothing more than being a girl and having a mic. saying shit like 'quit playing games to try and get dick' and calling her names for no reason than to be a misogynistic ass rammer. we ended up destroying him, both in the game and verbally for the next 20 minutes until he rage quit the lobby, and also decided to take out his crew mate in the lobby until he rage quit as well, cause well, the company you keep and all that.now, we are only playing with crew and friends for our chat setting, cause honestly we do this to ease the stress of a long work day and have fun...not get into shouting matches and have to worry about reporting pussy farts for verbal harassment and hate speech. unfortunately this limits the amount of people we can *become* cool with who you meet in a random lobby, and that sucks.if you are the kind of person that gets on mic specifically to insult someone for no reason...and pick on women because they are women playing a game 'meant for men' then fuck you.**YOU ARE NOT FUNNY, OR A BADASS, OR A STUD. YOU ARE A SCUMBAG PIECE OF SHIT WHO RUINS FUN FOR OTHERS AND I LITERALLY HOPE YOU MOUTH OFF *IRL* TO THE WRONG PERSON AND GET SHOT FOR REAL**/END RANTif you are NOT this person, feel free to add me, and lets have fun.

I am part of a very small, somewhat inactive crew here in Chicago. I am a dad to be (shes due in late March) and have read some cool things about your crew, and it would be nice to have some backup as well as people to back up when i free-roam...and more importantly, a chance to fill up missions with players who can help complete without having to coach whats upcoming and get frustrated when randos don't heed my advice based on experience. looking forward to playing with you all. Feel free to add me as a friend or just send me invites when I'm on. Typically I play from 3pm -9/10 PM (i work from home, so its just a quick commute downstairs!) during the week, and Fridays and Saturdays a bit later.

I was wondering if people could point me to solid resources that show why its important to vaccinate and that its not harmful as my wife would like to believe. I tried showing her info on the CHOP (children's hospital of PA) website that shows there is aluminum in everything but i feel it was on deaf ears. i am very much in support of vaccinating our child. She is as well, but feels we should 'not do it all at once' which I somewhat agree with (8 shots seems like a lot?) but i dont know if that's as safe as needed.i do plan on bringing this up with our midwives during our next appointment but any resources that can combat the blogosphere would be helfpul.

IIRC this happens when he is very young, perhaps about 5 or 6?I would like to see in one of the first season episodes a scene where Bruce actually has this happen, but its Alfred to the rescue. I think it would be a good scene to solidify the bond of these characters (in the viewers eyes) and give just a SMALL flavor of the bat mythos coming to bear early on. Granted, this plays a bit on the timeline of it happening, but it would be a neat tease to the casual fans, and a fun bit of winking and nodding to the hardcore IMO.Thoughts? Opinions?

2nz9fx	-30008	1417469308	electronic_cigarette	quick shoutout to my local B&amp;M - VaperZ on Harlem &amp; Archer in Chicago IL	so i broke my vamo a couple weeks ago...dropped it one to many times and the threading was stripped. I had visited this storefront once before to pick up an airflow piece for my protank2, and ended up grabbing a second tank and AFP cause i liked the draw so much.Anyways, the holiday was quickly approaching and I needed something new and didn't want to wait on shipping. I decided to go in and pick up a boxy device to prevent the roll/drop my vamos suffered. Figured an Itaste was gonna be the decision. When i started speaking to the rep (forgot your name, sorry dude!) we chatted about my needs, and he actually recommended me a E-leaf instead - and it was a cheaper device!After a week of having the device, i know it was the better decision. It burns way better than i will ever need, fits my hand nice, and i don't need to buy batteries for it ever again! I am shocked a company in this space actually *down*sold me to something cheaper, and would rather take a $30 loss on a sale - but for them it paid off cause anytime i need hardware again I am going there. So goodbye online hardware vendors - it was fun while it lasted, but I've got a better option 5 minutes away from me.If anyone else lives in the Midway area of Chicago, here is their website...i think they have other locations as well.https://www.vaperzonline.com/

2vwcuk	-30008	1423941711	predaddit	Feeling inadequate...	Just need to vent...maybe hear some perspective from you other dads to be.So I tried painting the nursery, failed...it looked like shit between the walls and the ceiling. Ended up hiring a painter afterwards to fix it. On top of that the color was different than we expected so I bought paint twice, pretty much doubled our costs there.Whatever. I can at least paint a closet, right. Looks good...bought shelving and a cubby thing from IKEA. Put the cubbies together, placed it in the closet, measured for an hour to make sure that floating shelf was in the right place before I put holes in my fresh walls. Looking good, but then I try to add the shelf to the bracket and it's off by a hair, can't get the screws in without moving the bracket and drilling new holes.Now I'm defeated. Gotta hire a handy man cause I don't want to fuck it up more. My wife is understanding and supportive but I feel like I let her down...we spent a bunch of money trying to DIY and we still ended up needing to hire someone cause I'm apparently not good at this simple stuff.I feel dumb and like I'm not good for anything but knocking her up. Dads are supposed to be able to do this, and here I am hiring someone to fix my mistakes. My gift to her was going to be the nursery...it will look good when it's done, but now I'll always know it wasn't cause I did a good job preparing for my son, it's cause we threw money at it to make it work.Maybe I'm just being a little melodramatic...Idk, any other dads to be frustrated by this kind of stuff? Edit: after a day or so to cool off, its gonna be OK.So I gotta hire a handyman no big deal. I've still got other stuff to do in that room when he is finished, and it's not like he's raising my kid. Thanks for the kind words and perspective everyone, it helped. Sometimes, especially when its a few weeks away, things seem like bigger problems than they are in the moment. No more DIY for me though ಠ_ಠ

Good series, for what it it's.Anyways, the opening them song is forever young, by Bob Dylan. During this song, there is a scene of the Braverman family eating. Pictures and videos of all the adult children of Zeek and Camille play, juxtaposed with the scene if then enjoying a family meal.None of the spouses have photos of them growing up, nor do the two "new kids" that came into the family as older children through adoption. Spoilers now! Reference: https://youtu.be/11hBvTO4jUoIn the series finale, Zeek dies. I suggest that this opening theme is what he is seeing as he passes...His family enjoying themselves, interspersed with memories of them all growing up. There are no pictures of Jabbar or Victor or the spouses growing up, because Zeek did not know them at that point in their lives.

Okay so i was playing on the oceania server.it was dominated by voz so kept my name kill(er)voz so i could infiltrate them and then kill them .i first earned the trust of the group by feeding them split feeding them so that they started feeding me back .Now they were chasing the 2 rank guy as the team had another person other than the mother cell i had to kill it. As the other cell started chasing the 2nd rank guy i went to the virus and shaot the virus such that the other voz guy became pieces and the rank 2 guy gulped him directly without splitting and the mother cell did saw me shoot the virus but some how the 2nd guy(O____O) hit a virus in order to keep the mother cell's trust i ate his pieces so that i can give my mass to O____O guy i carefully got cornered and fed my entire mass to it it was big enough to kill the voz mother cell and i died when i came back instead of seeing the O____O guy eating voz he became a team member of voz feeding him mass and at last gave his entire mass to voz what the hell all my efforts went ot waste why did he do that?

It happened suddenly on its own even if i try to zoom out only the leaderboard size shrank and my field of view got increased but only a bit. I use chrome here is the snapshot http://imgur.com/ySvUfym .If some else is experiencing the same problem please comment.

39b1da	-30011	1433949365	Agario	What does agar.io teach us ?	 The first thing that comes to mind is1). cannibalism. 2)equality as it doesn't matter whether you are good or bad in the game you are gonna get eaten sometime or the other. 3)size does matter so see the mass of the guy you mess with.4)being a opportunist the moment to split kill a person can come at anytime. 5)even small(weak) cells can lead to your demise if you you are not careful and your opponent is strategic.6)there is power in teamwork. i did like to hear from others what they think agar.io teaches us

So this is an important thread to all the people who play on oceania it is my humble request to please not give their mass to people who are associated with a clan.I have now witness enough of oceania server taken over by voz,hkg or any other clan there is a new clan has also now popped up with a ying-yang symbol in there name .Please under no condition give your mass to these clanner don't do teamwork with them you will be killed by them sooner or later .If your dying or in split state rather than getting eaten by the clanners its better to give you mass to someone who is large enough to not be eaten even if the cell is your mortal enemy .Specially to all the people who are on the ladder/leaderboard pleases team up if you have to but  the moment you see there is one clanner on the leaderboard you must do every thing in your potential to kill them first not other cell no matter what because the moment they start to spread in matter of minutes there entire clan will come and dominate the leaderboard and then will hunt in team.Even to all the small cells who are large enough to pop a virus be relentless and pop them as much as you can while the bigger cells try eat them for once we have to play together this has happened to me twice today .A perfectly clan free leader board turned in matter of seconds and was dominated for hours and hours by clanners until server reset.This is my request to everyone so that the gameplay is not ruined after you have killed the clanner stop teaming the bigger cell should give some mass to the person who he temporarily teamed up with to eat the clanners until both the cells are approximately the same size and then continue the normal cell hunting that is done .I can not stress this enough but the moment there is a clanner please kill him first. Hope that just by spending a few minutes in trying to eliminate them you are saving hours normal gameplay where everyone can enjoy and have fun.While not have to be forced to switch the server as they are clan infested and cann't be brought down.
3dwn88	-30011	1437363826	WarInSpace	[BUG]	As the title suggest i just started playing and this happened not to worry about if you were just updating http://imgur.com/RddbDXA,LT9BXcX
3fmeu9	-30011	1438611790	Agario	Its so fun to destroy a clan from inside	So i was this cell name meaning friends in vietnamese i started out as a teeny tiny cell the big cell didn't even teamed with me but i found i guy named heiu (some word probably )i teamed up with him took him to the ladder make him 3 he gave me the entry to the big teaming/clanning teamers they eventually started trusting me after i teamed with them died 4 times so that they can eat some big cells after that all my hard work bore fruits they gave me all their mass so i can eat a big cell with i did after that i killed every single clanner after which i happy donated almost all my mass and was about to pour my 500 mass (i donated my mass with in few seconds ).But alas my  efforts were wasted a new team arose and ate my 500 mass though the two cell indo and wojack who were very big were trying to removed the uprising clanners hope they succeeded in their efforts after which i went offline here is a snapshot to celebrate my victory http://imgur.com/KJ1xmgu .that small little wojack in the snapshot is the one that grew eating my mass as i was giving it to everyone.Now i feel good.

2w5bj9	-30030	1424139338	DoesAnybodyElse	DAE judge a person's character negatively when they go on multiple vacations with their family and your family can't afford to go on one?	First post Reddit! I know it doesn't correlate to who a person is but I can't stand when my friends (parents) can afford go skiing on a mountain, swim at the beach, and hiking in the woods all in one week of vacation and I'm home on reddit because my parents can't afford to travel. Some of these people are genuine assholes too so that doesn't make it any better, but many of them are good people so I really have no place to judge. TLDR -  DAE hate being poor.(relative to the people around them, I'm looking at you Somalia)

I was able to find the lyrics in Japanese and also the translated English lyrics. However, I cannot read the Japanese letters and was wondering if there is a translator available that would not translate the words into English but change them into the Latin alphabet so I could sing along in Japanese. I cannot find a tool like that anywhere!here is [the song](https://youtu.be/gtg-mK5E7Zw) by the way, I found it on /r/listentothis and the lyrics are [here](http://hinto.org/wp/?p=4757).

33u8a1	-30030	1429984733	personalfinance	First time Credit Card advice	Hi, I've been lurking in /r/personalfinance for awhile now and this is my first post here. This sub has helped me go from having zero financial knowledge to feeling like I could maybe become a financially secure adult. I'm an 18 year old high school student who will be attending college soon. I have a checking account and use my debit card for all my purchases. One of the things I knew absolute nothing about was credit cards. It seemed every financially secure adult (and even the not so financially secure adults) have a credit card. So I read up on the sub about credit cards. What I learned was...• High APR is not so important as long as I don't hold a balance and pay on time. (Which I plan on doing)• Rewards are nice and float around 1-2% and maybe up to 5% for specific purchases.• A higher credit line means I can spend more money a month.• I need a good credit score to be able to receive a good credit card.If anything I have is wrong or I'm missing something please tell me. So with that knowledge, I was able to find a few credit cards I thought would fit my needs. **Amazon Rewards Visa** - This card has a 3%, 2%, 1% rewards system, for Amazon, gas and restaurants, and everything else. I shop on Amazon fairly frequently so this card seems great.**Sally Mae MasterCard** - this card seems really good with a 5% on gas an groceries and 1% everywhere else. However, I'm worried I will not get approved for a card like this. **Journey Student Rewards by Capital One** - this has a 1.25% rewards for everything.**Citi Thank You** - This card has a 2% reward on restaurants and entertainment and 1% everywhere else.So I was wondering if there are any other cards I should consider or which of this cards are no good. I would also love any advice about credit cards in general that I may be missing (like some hidden fees or maybe a credit card initiation blood ritual) that I should take into account. My biggest worry is my credit score. I have no prior credit cards so I assume my history is zilch which is why I want to start building it now. Also, I heard applying for credit cards and being rejected is bad for my score. Also, I was wondering how my decision for a card now would affect me in the future (does my student card evolve into some adult card after college?). Any advice would be helpful and I hope other future high school grads find this thread helpful as they begin a new chapter in their lives. Thank you /r/personalfinance for being a great resource for a future college student.
35jk5i	-30030	1431302812	relationships	I [18 M] don't know hot to make my SO [18 F] of 1 year stop flirting with her friend [17 M].	Hi. My SO and I have been together for a year and everything has been great. Except for one issue... She has a friend, lets call him John, and he has a big crush on my SO. My SO and I both agree that he has had a crush on her for a long time so it is not just in my head. On top of that I think John is a big douche (I know I am probably biased). Our friends all agree that John is a jerk and even my SO says he is very annoying and privileged. In the few times we interact together, John and I have a lot of friction (Even before my SO and I started dating). To me, John is an asshole yet my SO is still friends with him. Fine.I tolerated the friendship because my SO is very shy. She has trouble making solid friendships and is kind of an introvert. Also, she says she doesn't like other girls because they are fake and un-relatable to her. She doesn't have many friends so John was OK if it made her happy. The gripe with me is that John is very touchy with my SO. He will come up behind her and cup her eyes, they hug a lot, and he likes to touch her face and pet her. To me that is blatant flirting on John's part yet my SO does not see it that way at all.I've told her how I feel about and have asked her to make it stop. I would like her to tell Jack that it is not OK to do those things. When a girl playfully strokes my hair or grabs my leg I make an effort to display my dis-comfort and tell them to "back off, I have a girlfriend." I think it is also un-fair to John because I feel my SO is leading him on by not curbing his actions. She just lets him touch her.She accuses me of being overly protective. She feels that I am trying to change her into something she is not. She doesn't have many friends so I feel bad. But i honestly think the only reason John is nice to her at all is because he gets satisfactions and affection from her.This may not seem to scandalous (she has never cheated me or anything) but this is a high school relationship so the little things matter and she is a big part of my small world.What am I to do? Am I in the wrong for feeling umfortable about this? Should I talk to John? What do I say to my SO? Please, any advice would be helpful, It's tearing our relationship apart. Thanks!**tl;dr**: My SO lets another guy flirt with her and I don't know how to make it stop.
3742hr	-30030	1432490920	gaming	DAE get horny for video games?	Sometimes when I'm in class, or hanging out with friends, or on a workout I get this almost "sexual" craving for video games. I start to imagine what I'm going to do on my computer, feel the itch of my keyboard, ect. This being very synonymous to when I'm aroused.. sexually (Sometimes this excitement gets physical). I told my SO about it and she didn't understand. Am I alone here or do other people get this craving?It's especially strong when something sparks my memory of games. Like learning about the Spanish Reconquista and EU4 or watching American Sniper and BF4.

I first applied for the Sallie Mae card because of how great everyone in /r/personalfinance says it is. I got declined, then I applied for the Citi student card and was declined again. I'm scared to try another card because I hear getting declined is bad for my credit.I'm a college freshman and have no prior credit history. I really wanted to start building my credit but these so called student cards are rejecting me. What do I do?

3dplqe	-30030	1437197888	Music	I'm a special snowflake that hates popular music	Hate seems like a strong word... I'm not a fan of a lot of today's popular music. I know this is a very general statement and everyone has different tastes. Being in college doesn't help. I am always surprised by the music at house parties and never have as good as a time as my friends, who know the lyrics to every song. So here is my solution. First, I made a playlist!* The playlist was based on many of the Top 50 Songs USA Chart on Spotify.* Whenever I hear a song at a party/car/mall/ect that seems "popular" I add it to the playlist.* I ask my friends for recommendations.* LISTEN LISTEN LISTEN. It's been my only go to playlist lately and the songs are sticking.I'll stick with these rules and slowly my playlist will grow. I hope by the fall semester I'll be as familiar with the music as my friends. I don't really love these songs but they can be catchy and some I am quit fond of. Does anyone else have a similar problem? Any songs I'm missing? How's your summer going?[Here is the playlist by the way](https://open.spotify.com/user/shotypie/playlist/20BnppvtlkwxiauloyXbDs)

Besides ping and speed is there no difference between domestic and foreign VPNs?Also, the whole episode is very funny and interesting to watch.

1ntrxk	-30093	1381035400	pettyrevenge	Petty by way of inertia	I recently had surgery to repair a ruptured Achilles tendon.  My daily commute to work involves a little over a mile of walking (house to bus, bus to subway, subway to work).  During the recovery time at home I quickly came to the conclusion that crutches would not be the best way of making this trip twice a day.  I acquired a knee scooter from my doctor which, if you haven't seen/needed one, is kind of like a four wheeled razor scooter with a pad around knee height.While I do enjoy wheeling up to a queue at the handicap elevator and catching the quick look of shame on a few able-bodied commuters as they silently slink away to the escalator this a story of one that did not yield.I generally shoot for the ends of the subway train as this where the elderly and handicapped are supposed to have preference.  I know this because there are signs posted that say as much.  The end of the row having room for walkers, wheelchairs and yes, knee scooters.  Most people, myself included, choose them for the leg room.  Most people, myself included, also quickly vacate the seat when appropriate to allow for someone who clearly needs it more.So I entered the last door on the last car and turned towards the front to survey my two options.  On the left of the aisle was a woman and young daughter with quite a bit of luggage.  On the right a single middle aged man with his suit coat folded on his briefcase between his feet.  I wheel up to him and make the generally accepted nonverbal signs that I would like to use one of the two seats he is currently using. I smile, make eye contact.  He smiles back. I make imploring look with head nod towards seat.  He loses the smile and widens his legs.  I get that he may have a need that isn't readily apparent on first glance, but I'm not asking him to stand, just move over a bit.  Neither of us are obese, there should be plenty of room, but here I am standing on one leg right in front of him as the train gets going.What with me being so close and certain laws of motion working as they do, it was too bad I 'forgot' to engage the brakes when the train did.  While his quick reaction and suitcase prevented me from actually hitting him, it was still worth it.  I hope he enjoys cleaning my wheel mark off his coat as well.

Having looked at others on the site we really liked one posted by [u/sexipixel](http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1bghsh/painting_the_nursery_mural_or_nesting_in_overdrive/).  After contacting her she was kind enough to send the digital files that just needed minor editing to match our wall configuration. (Thanks again!)We did switch to childrens literature instead of woodland creatures, and if time allows I have a few more I'd like to paint, but it is at a point where we are happy with it either way.  We like the blue tones, but already had that in our room.  Green was another option also taken out by being used already.

One Piece is probably the only thing that consistently elicits an emotional response from me.  While I haven't full on cried watching OP, I've teared up multiple times (e.g., Nami asking for help, Luffy vs. Lucci, Sabaody, etc.).  No other shows can give me this kind of feeling and that's why I love One Piece.  What about you?**tl;dr  When I watch One Piece, I FEEL!**

1n0kxx	-30100	1380004584	OnePiece	I just watched the Mugiwara Chase movie (the 3D one). Thoughts?	I really enjoyed it.  It stayed isolated from the manga and just created a fun half-hour adventure.  Also, I like the stylized 3D they used.  It almost looks like the graphic style they use for the games.Anyways, what're your opinions?
1n3bhd	-30100	1380098611	OnePiece	What I want for the Dressrosa climax [Manga Spoilers]	I want a good ol' Baroque Works/CP9 style showdown where each Strawhat fights a high ranking member of Doffy's crew.  We know Luffy will fight Doffy, probably with Law alongside him.  After that there are three "seated" members: spades, clubs, and diamonds.  I would say Zoro gets Diamante, Sanji fights Trebol, and Franky maybe takes on the Spade seat (maybe named Pala or Laya, he looked kind of bulky [here](http://www.mangapanda.com/one-piece/700/20)).  That leaves Nami, Usopp, Chopper, Robin, and Brook to fight some unnamed opponents.  They might manage to escape Jola and find some way to return to normal then one of them goes in for round 2.  There's Machvise (maybe?), the toy-toy fruit user (or whatever their fruit ends up being called), that old guy we've seen with Jola, the guy in the bottom right panel [here](http://www.mangapanda.com/one-piece/682/10), and that little girl (unless she's the toy-toy girl).  I don't know what the match-ups would be though.Or maybe they end up fighting CP0 and in that case, well, who knows what will happen.  There's way too much going on to try predicting things.  This ended up way longer than I intended.**tl;dr** it's been a while since we've seen the Strawhats all fight 1v1 and it'd be a good way to show off their true strength post-timeskip.  What do you think the match-ups would be?EDIT: Looks like the spade seat is named Pica.  I was...close?  Also, replace Machvise (since he's probably going to be taken care of in the coliseum) with whoever erases all the memories of the people turned into toys.

1qnjq2	-30100	1384473565	arrow	The writers' handling of plot points [S02E06 Spoilers]	I really like the way the writing team deals with certain plot points.  Here are two examples to illustrate my point.1. In the first episode we find out somebody hired goons to kidnap Oliver.  Same episode, we find out is was his mom.2. In the latest episode ("Keep Your Enemies Closer"), Thea breaks up with Roy (stupidly) without telling him the truth.  At the end of the episode, her mom tells her not to worry about it and she gets back together with him.I just love how they don't drag things out.  When Thea broke up with Roy, I thought they were going to milk that for at least a couple episodes.  I was pleasantly surprised when her mom resolved the issue.
1ucmsu	-30100	1388792822	hearthstone	Questions/Suggestions for Nozdormu	**Disclaimer:I'm not familiar with the Warcraft lore, so I don't know if this would fit with story consistency.**I think Nozdormu is just used for when you want a speed match so getting him/her out on turn 9 isn't conducive to that kind of game.  My suggestion then is to make Nozdormu a 1 or 2 mana 0/5 with stealth.  That way you can get it out early and, barring mass aoe, have it stay there.  What do you guys think?

2fhygg	-30100	1409870442	OnePiece	Thoughts on dofla's comment in chapter 759 (manga spoilers)	In the chapter dofla says that law would be the third "corazon".  I think this simply means he would be the third person to occupy the heart seat and would take on the name Corazon.I think this because diamante=diamond, trebol=club, and pica=spade.  Those are also the respective seats those three occupy.However, this doesn't explain law muttering "cora-san" when he gets shot.  The way i see it, there are two possibilities.  One: mistranslation.  I think this is unlikely since sa is easily distinguishable from zo in Japanese.  Two: dofla's brother was named cora.  This is much more likely, i think.I'm not sure if that covers it all, and this is probably a waste of a post, but i thought I'd lay my thoughts out for people to either agree with our disprove.Tl;dr law being the third "Corazon" only means he would be the third person to occupy the heart seat.

Easiest to see when fighting Skinnies (aka droopy-faces).  Before picking up an item they take 5 hits, after they take 6.Another bug I've noticed (quite annoyingly) is that if you kill a mulligan before a room has completely 'spawned,' they explode.  Not a champion, a normal mulligan.  And if you're able to kill one that quickly, they're pretty close to you and end your high damage run in a second.

2mmk6f	-30152	1416279090	TheSystemBureau	Prologue	 I think I remember how it happened, I think I was sleeping when I got a call, no a knock on the door. I opened the door "Are you Timothy Heffron?" said the secretary of defense, Robert McNamara, I relied with “No, I'm tired, but seriously I'm Tim," "Okay," He said with sigh because of my pun, “you need to come with me,” ”To go where”“To have a chat with the president” he said calmly It seemed to be over 2 hours in the limo, I fell asleep in the limo we were riding in, and I don’t think the agents seemed to mind. When I got to the White House the sun was beginning to rise and woke up 5 minutes before we got there. “Now I need to tell you, don’t make any more puns, please” McNamara told me. “Don’t worry,” I said “I’ll try not to,”“So Mister President, why did you have me be escorted to the White house, sir” I said in an exaggerated soldier tone.“Don’t you start again with that,” relied JFK“I can’t help it.”“I need something done; I need a thing created for this world that will help everyone” JFK told me.“Ah I see, but the problem that I see is that there is only one of me and about 5 billion people out there, unless you want me to teleport and cheat death all day long.”“I have a great man at work to create a system that will take your soul and transmit it to another body somewhere, then you jump up and start saving again.”“I see okay, but what if I need a team because I don’t expect these bodies to be cheaper than dirt so we need to have people to protect the bodies and extract them. ”“You have a decade to gather a team.”“Why so long?”“The coding, testing, field testing and extracting DNA from your team-mates, will take about that long to finish.”“I’ll see the science geeks in about 10 years, see yah.”Then we didn't see each other, well till the funeral of course, I think that’s why Kennedy wanted to get rid of the CIA because we were being created.

If yours is succinct, meaningful and consistently and coherently expressed, it will be able to break free. It will be hearable outside of your brand bubble, outside of Whoville.

16vdax	-30160	1358591544	learnart	What, in your opinion, is the best way to begin drawing something new?	I'm familiar with drawing animals, but I would really love to try my hand at people. I've got a couple anatomy books and I've been drawing from them, but I'm not sure if drawing a bunch of legs from a book is going to be the best way to learn.So what would you experienced artists recommend? Should I keep drawing separate parts before tackling a full person, or should I jump right into full bodies and let others critique me, or some other method? I appreciate any answers and advice :)

2jieaf	-30160	1413548502	summonerschool	How do you avoid throwing late game?	Hey guys, I have a general question. This seems to happen pretty frequently to me. All lanes win, or at least don't feed horribly, and we move to midgame, where we proceed to lose every team fight and they quickly get a gold lead on us and win.I get that this is a case-by-case basis, but what are some general things that can help us keep control of late game? I main support, if that helps. Vision isn't usually an issue, and peeling for carries probably isn't either(I play a lot of Lulu, Queen of Peeling).
2k20y7	-30160	1414029140	summonerschool	How do you beat a Ryze and Syndra?	Hi, lately I've been having a lot of trouble against both Ryze and Syndra.I'll start with Ryze. I don't top a whole lot, and my two tops are Wukong and Teemo. With both of them, I'm not able to fight Ryze. As Wukong, they never seem to fall for the decoy and just wait for me to be unstealthed so they can snare me, and then kill me. He gets too tanky too quickly for me to do anything, and bullies me too much for me to get farm. He eventually just dives with the jungle and I lose lane.As teemo, I knew the lane would be rough, but I did my best. I turtled super hard til 6 until I had ult. Then I scattered mushrooms under tower to try and prevent dives but they still happened. The shrooms didn't effect Ryze at all because of his catalyst giving him massive sustain. I ended up going 0/1 in lane, simply because I sat behind tower all lane. I figured things would be okay and Ryze wouldn't snowball, but low and behold he STILL wrecked everyone late game. He had freefarm but didn't get an absurd amount in lane(less than the ADCs and mid). I don't understand how he still ended up snowballing so hard.I just don't understand Ryze. He outrades me early, but then he carries late game.Alright, now for my ramblings on Syndra.I've mostly played against Syndra as Annie. As far as I know, Annie is decent against her. But I have yet to not lose horribly against her. I can outpoke early, but once she hits 3 she waaay outpokes me. At 6, she just pokes me down until I'm at 50%, then ults and ignites and I die. I dodge most of her Q's and stuns, but the few she does land hurt for so much that it doesn't matter if I dodge 90% of them. I can never get close enough to ult her, because if I get close, she gets an easy stun combo on me. I guess my only hope would be a flash ult, but if I'm behind it's not likely to kill her, and she'll just turn it on me and kill me.Thank you for any tips, I'm sorry for rambling!

366v64	-30160	1431802890	techsupport	Recently getting sporadic lag spikes	Hey! So over the past week I've been getting some random lag spikes every evening. They usually start around 5pm and go until at least 1am. The lag spikes come every ~5-10 minutes and last for about 30 seconds. The lag is bad enough that I can't load any webpages when they happen, and I disconnect briefly from any game I'm playing.I'm not connected with an ethernet and I'm not able to be, but the router is only about 10 feet from my laptop. We use two routers, one is a typical [comcast modem/router](https://cms-images.idgesg.net/images/article/2014/06/xfinity-wireless-gateway-100312678-large.jpg) and the other is a netgear router similar to [this](http://www.trendsetter.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Netgear-Router-Wndr3700-Wireless-n600.jpeg) one. I connect to the netgear router because it's closer, but the lag happens when connected to either router.The issue has only been going on for the past week, and I've never had this issue in the past so I wasn't sure what could be causing it. My first thought was that it might be the heat from the summer causing the routers to overheat, but in the evenings(when the lag spikes happen) the house is kept extremely cool.The lag happens on all devices, not just my laptop.Anyone have any ideas?

3an57s	-30160	1434921906	internetparents	Questions about bank accounts	Hey guys! So my dad recently gave me an envelope full of bonds from him and family that have all matured. I was told to open a savings account with them. The issue is that I live with my mom, and although she's wonderful in every other regard, she can be a bit dis-trustworthy with money and has a tendency to 'borrow' money from her kids and then claim she never borrowed it at all. This has happened with every bank account I've ever opened or had, so naturally, I'm a little hesitant about these bonds, considering they add up to almost $2000.How do I go about making a savings account in a way that she won't have access to it? Unfortunately she'll need to be present for the creation of the account since I don't drive yet, but since I'm 18 I think there should be a way to have the account in only my name.Also, I don't really know much about bank accounts, if any of you would be kind enough to brief me on it? With a savings account, will there be fees if I withdraw money or any kind of monthly fee, or does it depend on the bank? Can I get a credit card associated with the account, or does it not work with a savings account?Thank you guys a ton!

The issue is that when we skype while he's using the extension, I can hear videos he's watching and sometimes hear myself echo decently loudly. This only happens with the extension. So I was looking into finding him a replacement cord, but the issue is that the cable for these headphones is super weird since it's combined with a mic. It has two male and two female ends. My question was if there was a term for this type of cable, or somewhere that sells them? I've been searching and I can't find anything or anywhere selling them. Hyperx also doesn't seem to sell replacement cables.Thank you guys so much!

I was looking to buy them, but I'm definitely not going to spend the $250 they cost on Pottermore or Amazon. I'd torrent, but there are hardly any torrents, and the ones that are there have a ton of leechers or hardly any seeders so they take days to download on my crap internet.Is there a better place online to listen to them, or somewhere to buy them that won't cost a fortune?

Currently, I am having some trouble with the relative strength of some classes. I already had a player switch from an illusionist wizard to a beguiler, as it limits spell options and is easier to control, but I still have one player who I am worried about. Similarly to the wizard, who I was worried about ignoring any challenges and his illusion spells to prepare a bunch of fireballs, I am worried about this second player. He wants to play a divine summoner (with hopes of becoming a malconvoker) but has taken a liking to the archivist. In a similar vein, I worry about him learning so many spells that he can completely ignore his summoning spells and still cast as well as a normal archivist could (which is already a bit too strong for my tastes). Is there any sort of limited class, similar to the beguiler is to the wizard, that I can offer him? If not, are the any houserules I could use? Thanks!

(Extended Version: Sturdy as the ice, silent as the frost-bitten hills, and ephemeral as the shifting snow.)Flag: http://imgur.com/LPH0nmAGovernment: EcclesiocracyCapital: Ardon RockPopulation: 586,500Wealth: TBDMilitary: A highly trained but small force of 1,000 make up Yvasnia's elite guard. These soldiers are among the best, and could be the most skilled in the known world. Yvasnia has an additional 34,190 regular soldiers, but all are trained in highly effective guerilla tactics and are capable of taking down much larger forces.**Lore**Yvasnia is a Ecclesiocracy, meaning that it is ruled by a religious group that does not claim to be an actual divine instrument of its deity. In this case, the official religion of Yvasnia is the worship of Naduguer, bringer of winter and the spoils of conflict.  Although Yvasnia is a small nation, the vast majority of its resources have been given to its military technology and training during recent years, as Draussi has been raiding coastal Yvasnian cities for nearly 100 years.  Because of this, Ysvania primarily uses its military outside of home as a sort of "special forces" for other, larger armies. Yvasnia's troops are well known for their ability to fight well when outside of typical circumstances. Yvasnia's primary import would be TBD to make up for TBD in the country. Most villages exist solely to provide for the glorious capital, and most citizens are fiercely loyal towards the current king, the four-man High Council that assists the king in making decisions, and Naduguer. **Economics**Yvasnia is known for its sharp steel, produced from its stores of iron. Yvasnia is home to a special type of berries; known as Wintersend, which can have its juice extracted and put through a complicated process to create Ardon Oil, named after the capital of the nation. The berries only grow in the far north of Yvasnia in the mountains, and require special care from dedicated monks that pass down the tradition generation to generation. Yvasnia also raises hardy cattle that can survive the harsh cold, and grows barley in the warmer months. **Geography**Rolling hills surround the nation, and they are the reason that the borders were drawn where they were. In the very center, Yvasnia is almost completely flat, with decent farmland surrounding the capital. Although it is very cold, some crops such as barley and cabbages are still grown and cattle are raised as livestock. The northern part of the nation has mountains that rise out of the hills. **Foreign Relations**Yvasnia is a safe haven of diplomacy in the cold north, and serves as a solemn, bleak location for diplomats looking to have less-than-public meetings in a neutral land. Though far away, Yvasnia's remote location also insures the diplomats' safety and the nation's military force keeps them protected. When nations need to strike deals or discuss matters in secrecy, Yvasnian soil is a good place to do it. Yvasnia is the founder of the Northern Isle Covenant.Yvasnia has been assaulted by attacks from Draussi for years, though actual raids are becoming more and more scarce as of recent time.**Culture**Yvasnian culture focuses on the worship of Naduguer and on the basic lesson of completing tasks. While Yvasnia has few holidays, there are some. On the longest night of the year, when night lasts for nearly a week, the Yvasnians may not use any heat or light sources as a sign of respect for winter's might. This week is called Waning Week. On the longest day of the year, the country celebrates Waxing Week during which great feasts are had by all.

We thought that this might make it easier to "balance" the Lightbringers and would also bring new flavor and diversity to each nation, allowing them to stand out.

If there is anything you want other people to know about your nation and potentially use, post it here to be sure that other people see it. I think it would be best for these posts to be OOC, but you can make them IC if you like. I will start out with mine. **Yvasnia**Yvasnia is often used by other nations as a safe place to conduct somewhat shady business, such as illegal deals or war preparations. Yvasnia is used as a neutral ground for these meetings, which are held in secure rooms in the nation's capital under heavy guard to insure the safety of any foreign diplomats. As well, Yvasnia is known (usually only to foreign leaders that have access to privileged information, or talked about in hushed whispers in dark bars) for its highly efficient and deadly assassins, capable of being hired to take down even the most difficult targets for a price. Yvasnia typically remains neutral in wars as it is very far away from the mainland, but representatives of the nation are generally well-liked and the nation is considered to be trustworthy, as proven by its strict doctrine of confidentiality regarding assassination contracts or the secrecy of meetings. Again, this stuff is OOC, so you guys shouldn't use this stuff to metagame too hard if you can avoid it. Now post some cool stuff in here!

Capoliti had shown that it does not wish to join or group until it feels threatened, and as such has had its invitation rescinded. However, we urge that members of our Covenant do not attack Capoliti as it may prove useful in the future. We have gotten off to a late start, but a time schedule for these meetings has been arranged after receiving news of the Eastern Union's method of meeting. A new meeting will be held each year instead of every other year, and each meeting will last the entire year. Because of this, we have arranged for permanent housing for your nation's delegate and up to ten guards. If you wish to, you may send your actual ruler with up to thirty guards to any of these meetings and he or she will be held with supreme security in the safety of Ardon Rock. At each meeting, any nation of the Covenant may bring an idea to the table and have it discussed (OOC: make a new comment for something new to talk about, then discuss it by replying to that one.

2pr33v	-30167	1418959142	sevareign	Yvasnian Civil Opinions	Following recent events on the main continent, Yvasnians are beginning to show a small opinion on the matter. Yvasnians are slow to recognize political ongoings from the distant mainland, but this quarrel has lasted long enough to spark some interest. On a whole, Yvasnians are not very invested in the outcome of the ordeal. However, while citizens believe that Lummengrind overreacted and are therefore more likely to side with Castielle, others believe that the entire exchange was caused by Castielle's poor word choice and apparently threatening approach to missions. The Yvasnian royal crown has given no official ruling on what the country considers went right or wrong in the Lummengrind and Castielle exchange.

With that said, I would like some input on champion choice. Currently, my favorites are Anivia, Kayle, and Soraka. I recently purchased Thresh, but he has a very high skill cap and I am still very poor with him. Should I stick it out and learn to play Thresh? I've heard that he is very strong, and I think people typically choose a "main" champion to play. If it's worth it, I'll keep playing him. On another note, does anyone have any recommendations for fun supports? Recently, LeBlanc has been suggested to me, and playing unorthodox champions as support is appealing to me. Thanks!

Although most of the nations invited chose not to attend, we did expect more guests than from only Lummengrind, Draussi, and Bass'ku, as the nation of Erias sent a message announcing its planned attendance. Regardless, we shall celebrate greatly! For the next week, we will rejoice with bountiful food, drink, and entertainment.

Le'ku was engaged in a conversation with King Landro Tael of Yvasnia, who spotted the would-be assassin approaching and swiftly dealt with him. The assassin charged at Le'ku with a small, twisted  dagger held over his head and shouted "Death to the Ethereals." King Landro responded by swiftly grabbing the man's forearm with his left hand, then punching the man in the stomach with his right. The assassin fell to the ground, apparently unconscious, and was taken away by guards. He was reported to have died in captivity before any information could be extracted from him. King Landro gave little comment, stating only that "This intrusion is unacceptable, and we will discover the plan behind this attack. I am merely glad I was able to defend my companion."

2qljud	-30167	1419747269	DnD	[3.5] What to Allow?	Hi guys! I'm going to be starting a my first 3.5 campaign soon, and was wondering what you thought I should allow in the game. I would like to offer my players as many choices as possible, but some just seem ridiculous.First, I've heard all about the way that magic users trump fighters in this edition. However, I have a player that wants to play an archivist and one that wants to play a beguiler. The archivist looks just like a cleric, except the ability to learn any spell like the wizard. The beguiler looks like a mostly toned-down sorcerer, but it still gives some shadow spells that duplicate entire schools of magic. Both of these classes seem very strong, and I would rather not have them overshadow the other characters.Second, should I allow these classes as long as everyone in the game agrees that not everyone has the same amount of power? We are all used to video games with their endless "balancing" so that most things perform equally well, and I don't know how well my players would take that.Finally, if the players agree to that and I have a large mixture of power levels in the party, how would I go about providing challenges that are difficult for all members of the party? Is it impossible?I know this topic is often talked about, but I would appreciate any input. Thanks!

2qsu2v	-30167	1419929970	DnD	A New Threat	Well, as the time for me to DM another campaign arrives, I need to come up with a new enemy. Here's what I have so far:In my world, there is a pantheon of 50 gods. About 15 years before the campaign starts, extraplanar bug alien things arrive from another dimension with massive, planet-sized "deities" that each hold a regular god in check. In this way, both entities are nearly completely immobilized, and neither party can do anything besides receive/talk through prayers and grant divine spells. The regular male aliens are parasites that attach via the mouth and extend a tentacle into the body of the host, controlling it. The parasites are intelligent, but not very strong nor large. Thus, they have bred a "cattle" species over centuries that are strong-bodied, weak-minded armored insect bipeds that are perfect hosts. These troops (along with variations; maybe wings sometimes or acid spitting or whatever) are currently attempting to take over the world by eradicating/enslaving the humans and demihumans. The female versions are (probably going to be) large armored bipedal bugs, with limited mind control tentacle powers. So far, I'm thinking that they have no arcane magic, but maybe some psionics and definitely divine power from the alien deities. The whole thing seems a little sci-fi for what would otherwise be your typical D&amp;D setting, but I think it's interesting. Please offer any comments, suggestions, ideas, replacements, anything! Thanks.
2r96d6	-30167	1420332619	DnD	[3.5] Cost of a Magic Item	You guys are probably starting to recognize me around here, I'm another guy that's starting his first 3.5 campaign. I was looking at the *Greenbound Summoning* feat (which seems ridiculous) and heard somewhere that it was meant to be a metamagic feat with a +2 increase to spell level. Using this, I created a custom template similar to Greenbound, and am aiming to put it on a rod. For pricing, I used a Lesser Rod of Empower Spell (which would work on spell slots less than or equal to three, and uses a +2 spell level penalty) which costs 9,000 gp. Is that a fair price if the item can only modify *Summon Monster III* and below? Is Greenbound, and therefore my template, too strong for only a +2 increase?Thanks!

2uf09d	-30167	1422807334	canis	[CLAIM]	The Galdron are known as the strongest creatures on the planet. Each fully grown Galdron stands twenty-two feet tall, weighs eleven tons on average, and looks like a stocky, hunched over human, but with dark red skin, many brown chitinous plates, massively thick arms and legs, a more reptilian head, and a second, smaller pair of arms placed halfway down the torso. All arms and legs have four digits, with those on the small arms being fine and dexterous and those on the large arms being strong and large. Notably, the Galdron's chintinous plates are very strong and nearly impossible to break, meaning that attacks against them must be able to fit in the gaps between plates to have any chance of truly harming them. The Galdron are fairly intelligent, mainly due to the relative size of their brains and less to a pursuit of knowledge. However, much of a Galdron's brain is taken up by its Force Cortex, which allows it to control invisible energy that can be used to enhance strength, pick up and fire small projectiles with high accuracy, and provide a full-body shield against attack.Use of the Force Cortex is very straining, and though all Galdron can use it, those who train to hone it can use it much more frequently and with less fatigue.Galdron society is organized into peaceful packs, with the leader usually being deciding by the lifting of massive objects, usually finding trees hundreds of feet tall or boulders weighing dozens of tons to lift. Galdron are omnivores, and can consume both large animals and entire trees. However, due to their size, there are relatively few Galdron compared to the more prolific species.

We're starting at level 4, and basically all rulebooks are allowed.Idea 1 - Druid 4, with plans to take one more level of druid then move into the blighter PrC. I know that blighter is bad at first, but the flavor is so good.Idea 2 - Paladin 4, with plans to move into the bone knight PrC. For some reason these "corruption" of divine classes are really interesting to me, and the mechanics fit well.So, any thoughts? On other ideas that could be useful, tips or changes to my existing ideas? Anything!

The practice surely would pay off,  This was no simple game.He watched the crowd, the track began,  The drums beat to his heart.  Collectively the people cheered,  His song was soon to start.The boy, he’d learned to make suspense,  He stepped ahead alone.  A gasp was heard, his shoe was caught,  And soon the boy was prone.And though he fell, he crawled back up,  Resolved to see it through.  A silver-laden stage of black,  Beginning life anew.By now, the boy, he is eighteen,  And soon to find a girl.  He spots her at the county ball,  And moves to make her twirl.The two, they dance the night away,  Becoming friends at once.  The girl acts coy and shy and nice,  The boy acts like a dunce.But soon their friends, they notice them,  And want to make things right.  They split to form an opening,  When chance stops this boy’s plight.And though he fell, he crawled back up,  Resolved to see it through.  A silver-laden stage of black,  Beginning life anew.In time, this boy’s become a man,  A wealthy one, at that.  He’s finished school, and made a life,  Gone now to bell the cat.The man, he works a wanted job,  He’s hired on the spot;  “My lad,” his boss, he says to him,  “You’ll be an astronaut!”But training’s not an easy task,  Not for the weak of will.  Though those who truly seek the stars  Will find them surely still.And though he fell, he crawled back up,  Resolved to see it through.  A silver-laden stage of black,  Beginning life anew.And now, the man, he’s said good-bye,  He’s donned his favorite suit.  From friends and foes and family,  He flees in his pursuit.The engines start to roar to life,  A countdown starts to sound.  The man is pressed into his seat,  And says, “From air to ground,We’ve lost our rightmost booster seal,  Please tell our wives good-bye,  We learned this from the Challenger,  But now, we’ll surely die.”And though he fell, he crawled back up,  Resolved to see it through.

(Healing and Buffs)	I'm looking for a way to fit a particular character concept, which is that of a caster whose powers involve healing and buffing his companions but in a way that is undesirable. Maybe the healed wounds scar badly, or his buffs cause grotesque mutations to burst out of the targeted ally. Of course, spells like Cause Wounds and Vampiric Touch fit well, but what would work best?A cleric or favored soul? An arcane caster, wizard, dread necromancer? Does class matter, or is it accomplished well by certain spells? Is there some perfect prestige class for this I'm missing? Thanks!
31ncy3	-30167	1428341300	team60s	A New Order	I am repulsed by the attitude towards Non-Sixties here. We ARE the chosen people, and only through a combination of personal diligence, favor of The Button, and the misfortune of others are we in our place. Remember that to become a Sixty at all, you had to ride on the back of some other Presser; another, lesser creature, destined from creation to pave the way for your acceptance into the Sixty with its own Flair. We have grown soft. We must embrace the fact that The Button must sacrifice another Presser each time one of our own is created, and as proven by their Nonpurple Flairs, those Pressers have been declared as lesser creatures by The Button itself. What we must do now, in our ultimate goal of reaching Zero, is convert all remaining Nonpressers to Pressers, and allow The Button to determine who will join the Sixties in glory and who will fall and join the others in weakness.If this attitude cannot be created here, if Team60s proves too resilient to this true philosophy, then we will be forced to start a new order that is truly dedicated to the advancement of the Sixties and the destruction of all others.The Violet Hand rises./r/VioletHand

31pyl1	-30167	1428387305	VioletHand	The Violet Hand Rises	Welcome.First and foremost, an explanation.The Violet Hand represents those who understand and embrace the necessary sacrifice required to become one of the Chosen Few: a Sixty, and that the Purple color is above all others.In order for a Sixty to be created, another must sacrifice his own color and number to reset The Timer to a state in which a press of The Button will grant the Purple Sixty. These lesser creatures are not treated as lesser because we wish them to be subjugated to us, but because they have been decreed to be lesser by The Button itself. The lesser numbers and colors were destined to sacrifice themselves to create us, the Glorious Sixties. Because of their actions, we must respect The Button and know that they are inferior.As for the Grays, the Unpressers, they represent a lack of commitment and a potential threat to our ultimate goal: reaching Zero on The Timer. The only righteous way to reach this goal most quickly is to have all Unpressed become Sixties, through a combination of others' sacrifice, their own work, and the blessing of The Button. This is because a Sixty has produced the minimal possible impact while still devoting themselves to the cause of reaching Zero.While some Unpressers may tell you that they would not press The Button to prolong The Timer, do not let them deceive you: if they were truly committed to this goal, they would prove their dedication by becoming a Sixty.Although Sixties are the Chosen Few, even other purples should be treated with some respect. Fifty-Nines are the next most blessed, moving down in rank with the Fifty-Twos at the bottom. However, even a lowly Fifty-Two is still a Purple, and should be treated above the other Colors of Pressers and the Unpressers.These words represent the Truth of The Button, and those willing to devote themselves to the Cause may speak their minds here.Through all means, prove supremacy. Hail the Violet Hand.Your Archon, /u/Laserhamster1

The current positions are as follows:Publicity Overseer - In charge of spreading the Truth and the Word, must be well-spoken. *Assigned*Military Overseer - In charge of organizing and directing any war efforts, must be proven as dedicated. *Assigned*Recruitment Overseer - In charge of gathering new members and organizing them in the Templar List. *Assigned*Historical Overseer - In charge of hunting down references to the Violet Hand made by other factions and recording them to be used as a gauge of public opinion.Scripture Overseer - In charge of writing persuasive and passionate text about the Truth. *Assigned*Each member will be able to help with these groups, and will defer to the Overseer if he or she needs direction.

In the near future we will establish other ranks to apply to nonleaders.Through all means, prove supremacy. Hail the Violet Hand.

You cite me as inactive, something I agree with. To be completely honest, my activity declined greatly when I spent several hours per day for nearly a week fiddling with CSS and searching countless guide and tips on Google, to (obviously) no avail. During this time, I let many things slide past me, and was unable to catch up due to real-life events that, frankly, must come before the Hand. I hope that you all understand my reasons for this absence.In addition, there is little more to do at this point other than wait for the Knights' Zombie army to eventually run out. They may have won the battle, but due to the nature of The Button we are completely guaranteed to win the war.All hail the Violet Hand.

Over the course of this experiment, we established quite the name for ourselves. We were known as one of the fastest growing Factions, and quickly shot our way into the top ten Button-related subreddits in mere days.Though I, and many of you, became inactive in these last few weeks, in truth our work was mostly done. We had built a reputation and converted some to our side, achieving the noblest of causes before finally reaching our goal. I would like to say that I performed some espionage myself under alternate accounts, focusing on the various Gray Factions and the Illemonati. I would like to say that we were never compromised, and we endured even the harshest criticism.It has been an honor to come to know you all.Through all means, we proved supremacy.Hail the Violet Hand.

We both love going to Disneyland and we've talked about going with eachother because she has a new annual pass and has no one to go with. I really want to get a pass so I can go with her and start get things together for me but I'm short $200. I'm committed to school and sports at the mean time and getting a proper job is out of the question. How can I make a couple hundred dollars in my situation? I do have over $1k in financial aide for school but that's doesn't seem like a good way to use that money. Or is it?? Any advice helps.

Fuck it right in the fucking fuck. I only have 2 classes left before finals and that's 2 days too many. I'm tired. I had work til 1:30 am. Got home around 2:00am and now I have to get up at 6:45 to go to school? It's 5:00 and I'm still fucking awake! Don't get me wrong, I love work. I look forward to going to work because my job is pretty good enjoymentwise (pay's alright) but school just ruins my mindset. I hate just sitting there, rotting. Last weekend I went out with my closest friend and we had a fucking blast. I hadn't had that much fun in like a year. Ever since then, I keep thinking about why I'm making myself suffer by doing things i don't want to do. I want to go out and party like I did last weekend, I want to go to work and just joke around with my coworkers all while getting paid, I want to keep playing soccer cuz it's something I really love doing and I'm actually good at it. I'm not good at school, I'm awful at school. I'm failing 2 of my 3 classes. I have an A in the other class cuz it's something I'm actually good at and interested in, graphic design. I know I sound like a douche but it's been a long long time since I had a enjoyable everyday life. I'm so close to it but school is fucking up the formula. These couple days couldn't come any slower.

I was only annoyed because you and your wife insulted an elderly group of customers. I'm a quiet person. All I do is stand there and do my job, make sure everyone is safe. I don't try to get involved with the many situations of frustration I see every time I have to work. But the one time I decide to say something because you were being so rude and irate, you turn out to be the type of person who had nothing better to do than complain to management. You are the worst type of human. I'm just some kid trying to make some money to get through school. I bet if I was much older you wouldn't have said anything. I'm pretty sure I'm one of the youngest people who work there if not the youngest and I wish you could fucking understand how difficult it is to be in control of the many many many customers who come to our location and many of then people twice, three times and even four times my age. It's a challenge and people like you make it worse because we are the last employees you see before leaving and we are the people who you let all your anger out when we're just doing our jobs. I'm just doing my job. This is my first job. Fuck you.

2gre3c	-30172	1411047925	DestinyTheGame	Purchase Basic Titan Mark?	After levelling up to 20 I chose a FWC for my Titan as the standard Titan vanguard armour for sale always offers Strength and either Discipline or Intellect. Therefore I could mix and match them and have a fairly balanced character.Anyway in my haste after I purchased the FWC mark I deleted the basic make by mistake. Now I can't aquire vanguard rep.The marks available from the Titan vanguard are both legendary and require rank 2, something I can not achieve as I have no mark. These are the only ones I can see.I am happy to pay for a new basic mark as I cocked up but the only way I can think to do this is create a new Titan, vault the mark and claim it with my existing one.Any other ideas would be appreciated.

2qge6e	-30172	1419612261	DestinyTheGame	The more I read about Toland...	The more I think he should have been our guide through destiny rather than the stranger/eris.My destiny would go like this:Things start as normal kill fallen on earth, discover the hive and go to the moon.Then we bump in to Toland who tells us he's exiled because everyone reckons he's cracked but there's a real threat out there that the speaker will not acknowledge. First though we need to delay the hive invasion that he and eris et al were sent to stop by destroying the shrine of oryx. Once this is done he sends us to Venus/mars to deal with the vex. After this he is welcomed back to the tower where he tells of the hive threat that leads into the dark below.Fits the timeline of events bungie put in place but involves much more lore there seems to be flying about and would be more coherent.Thoughts?

2wb9f9	-30172	1424269091	DestinyTheGame	[lore] The Arena, HoW Raid	What do you think of when you think of an 'arena'? Me, I think it's a fighting pit. Possibly populated by Gladiators.Yes the next raid will be a rehash of the popular ITV 90's (and not so popular Sky 2000's reboot) of the TV show Gladiators! With the queen and her brother reprising the roles of Ulrika Johnson and John Fashanu, the raid will see Guardians pitted against the Fallen in a number of greulling events such as Hang Tough, Duel and Swingshot.And the biggest clue of all? It is named House of Wolves after all, it's obvious that the HoW Kell is Wolf who is forcing them to do this after the series falling out of favor and ultimately being cancelled.
2xi7dd	-30172	1425163972	DestinyTheGame	[Suggestion] Yes, raid weapons need to be upgradable but they should still be at a level equivalent normal mode of the current raid.	For example, the current stiuation is that vog weapons are 300 or level 30 weapons. These are adequately levelled for nm crota. If you want proper level raid weapons for hm (331 or lvl 32) you have to have stuff from crota.Next dlc, vog weapons should get buffed to 331 and crota weapons stay the same. Thereby, old weapons are still viable for the most part but new weapons are desirable for the highest level of content.I think this would be the most amicable solution for players and bungie.

As PoE is not a raid should it drop the same sort of gear as VoG and CE ie. max fallen inspired armour and elemental weapons?Do you think Bungie will be saving the Fallen inspired gear that has been leaked previously for the raid that will be released later in the year and that this upgrade system is to appease us until then?Also, if you notice, in it's teasers so far Bungie has not even hinted at this gear (Whilst they have with Osiris). 
35lcld	-30172	1431350138	DestinyTheGame	With the excitement over new vendor gear buzzing about the place, what current vendor gear do you currently use over raid/exotic weapons?	Honestly I only use my void plug.1 and I think that's it. I appreciate that I might be in the minority (only missing foil from raids and hawkmoon from exotics) but I overlook standard legendary weapons, I am right in doing this? Or are there some gems I'm missing?I guess what I'm really asking is are any legendary weapons you would rate higher than raid/exotics as I don't often see them compared.

3aa72t	-30172	1434633891	DestinyTheGame	[Spoiler] Gorgons look like Taken.	*This is posted as spoiler in case anyone is deliberately trying to avoid any knowledge of TKGHi, haven't seen this crop up yet but to me Taken look to various enemy types as Gorgons do to Harpies. Also, no images of Taken Harpies have been shown yet.In the ViDoc they say that Taken enemies have new abilities compared to their normal guises, are these the sort of mechanics we can expect?As for if Gorgons are Taken or not the grimoire reads:Deep in the Vault of Glass, the fabric of reality bends to the will of the Vex. Warlocks speak in tones of awe of the Gorgons - creatures that seem to possess a dreaded, almost unimaginable strength: an ontological weapon. Like the Oracles and the Templar, the Gorgons reputedly possess the ability to define what is and is not real. Whatever they perceive becomes subject to erasure at their will. Until a countermeasure can be found, Guardians must avoid their gaze at all costs - or reply to any detection with immediate, overwhelming force. The Gorgons' ability must be tied to the nature of the Vault of Glass. We can take some solace in the clear fact that the Vex cannot manifest this power in the world outside. So this is pretty unclear as to there exact origins, it is assumed the Vex created them but not confirmed.What if the reason they are down there in that labyrinth, away from all other Vex as well, is they will delete anything their gaze falls upon. Guardian or not. Maybe the Vex took back these Taken Harpies to put in as extra security for the Vault from a different time/dimension where they have encountered Oryx before.

So this article seems to suggest that to get 'no time to explain' (new exotic) you need a stranger's rifle to upgrade.http://destiny.wikia.com/wiki/No_Time_To_ExplainI've been trying to get this back for ages after deleting all 3 of the ones I got without success but wasn't really too fussed outside of novelty value. Now it will be a viable weapon in all forms of the game I regret my decision even more.I've wanted to redesign my warlock for a while so don't mind running the story again that much and I know you get the xp boost with TK but it's the subclass trees that daunt me.

Not too long ago I got the idea in my head that there might be new designs for the class items from the speaker in TTK. So, of course, I did what any sane guardian would do and went on a massive mote fuelled binge grabbing everything that was pretty.Now that TTK will have the same items but with a stat roll will I have to buy these again or will the ones I have update? Or is this not known?I only ask this as I believe this to be a new problem in vendors have always changed stock with DLC and not just upgraded versions of the old item (for example there wasn't just an upgraded Shadow Price added with TDB, the Vanguard sold a whole new AR).

Sorry if my grammar is awkward I'm high and really needing to replay this game except I don't know what it is.I know it was either Medal of Honor or Call of Duty (the older ones before 2007 for sure). In this game there was a scene I remember distinctively where you drive a jeep through a field of wheat or something. There are also hay barrels everywhere (like these: http://ontariorabbits.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Hay.jpg). I also vaguely remember a mission where you are walking through a village and it's WWI or WWII. Anyways you enter a house on a hill and all these Nazis or something attack you. I don't know if this is the same game but this is all I remember.For nostalgia sakes, if anyone knows anything like this I'd really appreciate it.

To clarify:I don't have a girlfriend, thus I didn't get her a valentine. So usually I just say 'No'. That way my parents don't know if I don't have a girlfriend or if I just didn't get her a valentine.I like being ambiguous (aka "messing with them") so what is the proper (and douchiest) way to respond to that question, other than 'no'. I am talking about logic here, where my answer is true but convoluted and confusing. Muahaha. My thanks go out to my forever alone brothers, and anyone else who answers.
qa7f4	-30187	1330463050	writing	Request: Help in romanticizing a gruesome event. 	Thought it might be unsettling to put this in the title: I am looking for a way to "romanticize" or 'euphemize' a scene for a work I am writing, which is intended to be a rape scene.I feel that it is wise to point out the work is specifically a song going into a concept album That has no real bearing on the situation though; if I have a paragraph of prose I can easily turn it into lyrics.What I am asking for is symbolism: metaphors and personification and all that good stuff. This is so that the song can communicate the occurrence of a rape--without ever saying 'rape'.So far I have thought of:* Personification/Animorph: somehow describe the male aggressor (specifically his private parts) as a masculine animal like a lion or cobra. I feel this might come across as facetious or humorous, though.*  Metaphor: liken the the act (thrusting) to a natural event. Say, a natural disaster (tsunami) or phenomenon like tides.*  Represent the virginity of the female with an animal, or (less cliche), an object like a pearlHere is a real bombshell, ripe for metaphor. The male aggressor is the female's dad, though she does not know it at that point in the story. I want to do something with that, but be more literary than stating "and the father took the daughter"...I want to be less obvious.The ideal is for the average listener to not realize a rape occurred without having been told so. But it still needs to communicate a message of violence/taking of something. Thanks in advance, all assistance is appreciated.

I just saw a centipede-like creature that was the weirdest creature I've ever seen. It was literally like nothing I've ever seen. The closest comparison I have is a centipede with spider legs. Here's the best description I can give (From as close as I cared to get to the nasty thing):* centipede-like body, elongated, probably 2-3 inches long* The WEIRDEST legs of anything i've seen, long spindly red legs on the body and these white and black legs at it's hind that resembled spider legs* Feelers at the head with what I assume were two black-dot eyes* A seemingly furry/fuzzy body with these two parallel black "racing stripes" running the length of the body.* It was moving FAST, it had a grip on this rock wall in my backyard and was running along it horizontally.* It actually resembles [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Scutigera_coleoptrata.JPG) but I'm not entirely sure it is a match.* ALSO: I live in Southeastern Pennsylvania if that helps.I may be right in identify it as the S. Coleoptrata but I don't think it's right. I'm just really curious as to what this creature was, can someone possibly identify it?

1ceeyc	-30187	1366046589	tattoos	Advice needed on first tattoo, know placement, unsure of what to get...	As the title says, I am looking to get my first tattoo sometime before the end of this summer, before I leave for college. I am 17, will be 18 in June. All I know as of right now is that I want to get a tattoo on my upper left pec. Other than that, I only have some ideas floating around, nothing really solid at all yet.I want to get something meaningful to me, something with a real meaning. But when I try to think about what has had the greatest impact on my in 18 years, and that would ALSO make a great tattoo, I get stuck.So a little history:--I started playing guitar 4 years ago and my senior graduation project is on audio engineering so me and my friend are making an EP/album. Music is probably the thing that stands out as really sticking with me the past 18 years. After I was about 12 and listening to Fallout Boy, Coldplay, etc. I really discovered indie/alt music such as Bon Iver, Fleet Foxes, Radiohead. I listen to music ALL the time. ALL the time. But I don't know how to translate that to a kick-ass tattoo.--I absolutely love [this tattoo](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8omIfpcw-Lw/TwvDukjbRpI/AAAAAAAAB8Q/tpWWi49I0t0/s1600/bon_iver.jpg) on the lead singer of Bon Iver, Justin Vernon, who is also my main musical influence. That placement, design and flow really strike me. Obviously it is a little high up on his neck; I am going to school for Biochemistry so I would need the tattoo to be hidden by crew necks for career purposes, but I would like it to show when I wear v-necks.--Just as a little more about me, I am going to school in Central California, hail from western Philadelphia suburb and that's about as interesting as it gets. At the risk of sounding like a douche, I haven't really had any hardships in my 18 years of existence, it's been kind of peachy: all the grandparents that were around when I was born are still alive, the biggest thing is my dad was diagnosed with *mild* prostate cancer for about 9 months after which he tested negative, it was scary but didn't really have a huge impact on my life...So my question is: can you guys offer any inspiration or words of wisdom for finding a design for my tattoo? Any flash/photos of tattoos that you think might give me a better idea of what I should get for myself. Sorry that I gave a textwall, I guess that just shows how serious I am taking this...which I suppose should be a good thing. Thanks!

So I've decided to take up HTML as a means of creating my own personal website to act as a resume/cv of sorts (i'm currently in college, not for CS). I've had a very specific design in mind since the beginning, and I've come across a (free) bootstrap template that is almost exactly what I want: [Grayscale Template](http://startbootstrap.com/templates/grayscale/)Only problem is I don't really feel as though I've accomplished anything if I take this template and change the paragraphs and formatting a bit. So my question is: what is the best way to go about emulating this site, from scratch, to give me a similar but decidedly original website?I have enough knowledge of HTML and CSS to create the general layout of the site, but the transitions (navbar, buttons) and such elude me...

I am fairly new to web dev so it may be a simple mistake I am unaware of, but I have a feeling it is due to a conflict of the messy nesting divs and overlapping CSS classes arising from the bootstrap template and my alterations. The js fiddle has just the header I have built, the css I wrote to alter the bootstrap style is at the top while below I pasted in all the bootstrap CSS from the three template files I got from them.**Also, to see the full site for contextual purposes: http://tylerkontra.com/**Any help is appreciated, thanks!
26ifae	-30187	1401098440	cscareerquestions	Proving skills to employers?	Hi, I'm currently a freshman college student studying biochemistry. I have begun to explore computer science and teaching myself to program, starting with python. I absolutely love it and see myself delving into C/java/php soon enough (although I feel python may be most applicable for my major field). I was wondering however, speculating far into the future, how will I prove to employers that I do indeed have experience with those languages? Do they take my word for it, and perhaps I include a sample program or app, or are certifications worth pursuing?Thanks in advance

26ut5u	-30187	1401430951	California	Student bringing car to CA.	Hi, so I am from PA (registered PA resident, voter, etc etc) and I'm currently attending Cal Poly SLO. In August I will be driving back my car (owned by my parents) to keep in San Luis Obispo for the next 3 or so years while I attend college. My question is, is there anything I need to be aware of/take care of with the car before I bring it here. My understanding is that because I am a student I don't need to register it in CA, but will I need to get it emissions tested, and things of that nature? Thanks for the help!

Now, I'm not a computer science or even an art related major, I am a biochemistry major but I have always loved computers. So I decided to learn web design to build myself a personal resume-type website, just something to put on a business card and have a dynamic CV for employers, etc.I've put together a basic one page website that I am pretty darn proud of but it still doesn't feel SUPER professional like I want it to. And I am stuck, so I was hoping to get your input on my site and hear what you think I should change/add. Thanks in advance!www.tylerkontra.com
27f7lj	-30187	1402007555	linguistics	What is the proper name for this type of sentence/clause?	I was browsing reddit just now and came across this sentence of the type that I see all to often:"Punishment would put people that are at risk to do the same action again away." which is a more confusing version of"Punishment would put away people that are at risk to do the same action again." I can see that in the former the verb is at the end. What is the name for this type of syntax/voice and is it even considered grammatically correct?

29alj3	-30187	1403923752	AskElectronics	2003 GMC Envoy, New Head Unit and Zero bass from front left speaker.	So today I replaced the stock radio head unit in my '03 Envoy with an Alpine CDE-143BT unit. Checked and double checked wiring diagram and connections to GMOS-01 harness then installed into dash w/ antenna adapter. Radio powers on and gets reception, however now the front left (driver's side) speaker puts out absolutely ZERO bass/mids. Highs (tweeter i'm assuming) still comes through.Faded sound all the way front and left through head unit and still nothing so I don't think it's polarity...Could it be something with the wiring/harness/head unit or is it likely the woofer cone is blown? And where do I start troubleshooting?

So I bought myself a slingbox M1 and am planning on getting an extra cable box for my parents house and paying them monthly for that. My question is, how can I use the M1 (no coax input) with the Comcast DTA (digital tuner box) that only outputs coax. I have been looking for a coax--&gt;component converter box and came across some info that VCRs were also RF coax pass throughs (converters). Would DTA--[RF]--&gt;VCR--[Comp]--&gt;Slingbox work?I'd rather pay the 2 bucks a month for the DTA instead of 10 for the full digital set top box.

Here is the situation: My father and I will be driving my 2003 GMC Envoy ~2800 miles from Pennsylvania to California, mainly to transport my car to my university. We have already performed the following:* Transmission drain and fill* Air filter replacement* Oil change/oil filter replacement* Fuel filter replacementMy dad has always kept up with regular maintenance, etc. so the car is in great shape, and has low miles at ~91,500 and ~11 years old.So my question is, what else is necessary/recommended before such a long trip.I am thinking some brake maintenance and tire rotation/alignment might be good but I am no expert. Is it worth taking the car to a mechanic for a full inspection to get an idea of what is worn/needs tuning (if there is such a service commonly offered)? Thanks!

I remember iTunes used to have single-artist playlists, 3 of them like "intro", "deep cuts", and another deeper list of album tracks. Do you start with their "the essential..." album and work your way from there? Just curious as there are a lot of old artists I'm interested in listening to more but want to feel out their sound and how it progressed through their career.

2m5d7a	-30187	1415851157	changemyview	CMV: I want to be disgustingly wealthy and am convinced that is the best thing for me.	I'm a sophomore in college, Biochemistry, if it matters (you'll see why I don't think it does). I have my heart dead-set on being fabulously wealthy as soon as possible. I'll probably come of as a completely pompous idiot, but I'd just like to say I don't ever really talk about this with anyone I know, because I know how ridiculous it sounds.So I want to graduate college, get my entry level job and plan on just ~~climbing~~ flying up the corporate ladder to my eventual position as Chief Something or Other where I make a million or more a year...sounds like I don't have my priorities straight right? That's what I always read and I'm not convinced.Ever since I was young I have been an 'achiever'. My mother tells me of when I was six and would read the dictionary before bed some nights. Or how I would never be quite interested enough in the fact that the wood floated on water and the metal sank, but rather why the wood was different from the metal in the first place. Small things like that.And then I went through high school, I didn't get a 4.0 because I'm lazy but hey, it's who you know, not what you know right? But I was always thinking of where I would go to college that would set me up for the most successful career.And then I realized it didnt matter so much where I went but rather that I went at all. So here I am, enjoying college, but every day I think of which professor can I talk to that went to the best PhD program and can get me in three years from now. Or which internship would look the best on a resume. And how quickly I can become a millionaire after I graduate."Money isn't everything", right? Well of course I don't argue with that. I just want a lot of it. I think being a billionaire would bring me the greatest satisfaction. In addition to that, power, respect and a fame of sorts are my priorities too. Exert influence over the economy or the social progress (healthcare, drug prices, etc.) of a nation (this is where even I start to think I'm getting ahead of myself). I don't see any reason why I shouldn't want this. But I think about it so much that I figured I should at least write it down, and get some opinions on it. I always think, Bill Gates or Warren Buffet probably didn't think at 18 "I want to be the richest man in the world", and they got there. So if know I want it, why shouldn't I get it?EDIT: does it change at all if I instead say, I want to make $400k+/year and be really really comfortable financially? If so, why?_____&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

2omoet	-30187	1418026124	chemistry	Advice on computer science pursuits for chemistry major/statistics minor	I am currently a sophomore chemistry major, pursuing a minor in statistics. I also have an interest in programming and I have dabbled in python before. I am considering learning a programming language on my own time to improve my resume. I am hoping to go on to a PhD in chemistry and perhaps an MBA to work in the pharmaceutical industry. Obviously I will learn R through my statistics courses. But I am curious if there is a general purpose language that is worth learning to make me more attractive or well rounded as a chemist. Python perhaps? Or something more low level? Any general advice on how to best prepare for graduate school/careers outside of programming pursuits is also appreciated.
2r6eet	-30187	1420262197	Entrepreneur	Looking for feedback on a website idea	Hi /r/Entrepreneur! I have an idea for a website, and after thinking of it I have come across a very similar site, universitytutor.comI feel that I can create a better website for tutor review and matching. I also feel I can monetize it better.Basically what the site does is provide students a list of tutors for whatever they are looking for. The can search by subject, location, online or in person, and they can read reviews of these tutors. I have noticed at my school there are many flyers for tutors but no place to find good reviews, so it is all word of mouth. And some tutors are bad but you don't find that out until it's too late!What flaws do you see in this (rather vague right now) idea? Too hard to monetize? Not enough demand/need? Too strong of competition with universitytutor.com (I think they are a weak competitor). Thanks!

322uwv	-30187	1428635693	legaladvice	Roommate moves out before lease is fulfilled, pet left damages to unit	EDIT: Location is California, USA.Recently, my roommate (B) told myself and my remaining roommate (H) that he would be moving out immediately, not paying rent any further. We all signed a lease that ends this June 30, so he is technically in violation, but wants us to sign a roommate release agreement. We are open to doing so, to relieve him of his rent payments, but the problem is he had a dog (in violation of the lease, which stipulates no pets at all) and we want to make sure if the landlord charges us (we're expecting them to want to replace the carpet because of all the urine damage, and they'll probably make up something about fleas) for damages caused by his dog, that he will still be responsible for paying those, even though he was removed from the lease. Is this possible/enforceable and what kind of wording would be required in a written contract of some sort, and is it worth it to have it notarized? Thanks for the help.
367r4l	-30187	1431820742	chemistry	How to get a masters?	I'm a rising junior chemistry major, and I'm trying to figure out what I want to do after I graduate. I have read all the threads regarding PhD vs MSc on this subreddit, chemjobber and every other blog and I am leaning towards a masters, as I intend to work in industry (and pursue an MBA or some alternative degree later on). The problem now is that there are very few (and fewer quality) *terminal* masters programs in the US. So my question is, do I just contact chemistry departments and ask to be admitted as a masters candidate, or do I enter in pursuit of a PhD, knowing beforehand that I will drop out after qualifying for the MS? In addition to this, does anyone have any opinions on [Penn's PSM program](http://www.sas.upenn.edu/lps/graduate/mcs)? I know it is fairly new, but there are similar program's and to graduate from Penn would be nice, but I fear the PSM is not very valuable in industry.Thanks for the advice.***the response has been awesome! thanks everyone for the help, the chem community is awesome!***
3d72bl	-30187	1436835461	academiceconomics	Econ Graduate (Masters) Programs after Science BS?	Hi I am going to be a junior pursuing a BS in chemistry. I have always been interested in economics and definitely do not want to work in a lab all my life, so I have ruled out a chem PhD.I have begun considering MA/MS economics programs, but the amount of ECON prerequisite courses are too much for me to complete before I graduate. So my question is, are there any (decent) econ masters programs with short prereq course lists. I have come across JHU's and Georgetown's Applied Econ MSs but fear they are looked at as inferior (i.e. better to just get an MBA later on). How about Duke's MSEC? I want to get a masters degree straight after undergrad before hitting the job market because job prospects for Chem BSs are dismal ($30-40k starting), and I need work experience before getting an MBA (considering MBA/MPH). So I would definitely prefer to expand my knowledge and CV rather than make a weak salary.If there are no good programs suited for STE(M) undergrad curriculum, would my application be just as strong if I take the econ prereqs at night school after I graduate with my BS?I don't plan on pursuing a PhD in economics either, so that's why I was considering the applied programs.Sorry for the long winded post, I've got a lot on my mind and appreciate any advice! Thanks!

I'm sick of Knightwing presenting all this false information on DLC for this game and Batman lore in general. The dude barely knows his shit about anything other then the Arkhamverse, he hates the new 52 and only knows things about the batfamily that a quick wiki search or blockbuster movie will tell you. He is not a  member of the press, not AT ALL associated with Rocksteady (as proven many times with his BS tweets about DLC) and definitely not a true batman fan! he's a let's play youtuber looking for attention and views. He thinks he's "famous"From his WB Forums Post:"Someone famous like me dropping by this group apparently isn't cool. Ah to each his own. So we are clear, i sent the POC's a clear, statement in PR lingo, attached with pics of the Keaton suit and a clear discription, they can't dodge."http://community.wbgames.com/t5/Batman-Arkham-Knight-General/It-s-Official-ALL-Batmobiles-available-in-story-mode/td-p/707667/page/6Don't let attention whores tell you whats official and not official! it's tearing this fanbase apart with arguments and lethal posts directed to Rocksteady, when it's these youtubers who are making the turmoil not the devs!/rant overEdit: Seems I missed this post, Redditor telltalemaster is feeling the same as me!His post: https://www.reddit.com/r/BatmanArkham/comments/3glty7/stop_believing_in_arkham_ecelebs_wait_for/

2a4a6i	-30215	1404795786	smashbros	How to start a community of competitive smashers?	First of all: Sorry if you find any grammatical/orthography errors. English is not my first language. Spanish is.I'm a peruvian smasher, not pro, but not a noob either. Been watching tournaments and learning strats and the metagame since 2010, but just decided to start playing competitively since last year. The thing is, I want to start a competitive Smash community with other people, but here, Smash is not considered as hardcore as other games like CoD, DoTA, LoL or even FIFA. Those games have communities and a lot of gamers trying to get better and better. Sponsors are, also, almost non-existant here, and again, they are only interested in those who play games like the ones mentioned above. We are just a bunch of humble people playing the games we love al hardcore levels. Smash here is usually seen as a fun game, played mostly by casuals. Only a few really know how to play the game, but they do not know anything about basic stuff like short-hopping or wavedashing, necessary to play at competitive levels. Still, me and my friends are interested in starting a Smash community, with players that can really compete and that love the game, and want to take it to the next level here on our country. The thing is: how? Could you give us some tips? How to find those who would be interested in being part of this community? How to host tournaments? How to improve our game?Things like owning GC Controllers, TVs, GCs/Wiis are not a problem. The real problem is reaching to the people. And maybe some day have a community that can create an impact in the game. That would be awesome.TL;DR: How to motivate players to become part of a competitive Smash community in a country where Smash is considered a casual fun game? Where to begin?Thanks for taking your time to read and reply, really appreciate it.
2a9pcx	-30215	1404936525	smashbros	Settings for recording Melee's footage with Elgato Game Capture HD?	Some time back I managed to buy an Elgato Game Capture HD, and it works great on my Wii U for recording footage in 1080p. But when it comes to my older consoles, especially my GC/Wii, and SSBM, which I play in a CRT TV that doesn't have inputs for Component Cables, I don't know which settings to use to get the best quality possible, not only for Youtube videos, but also for streams.Whenever I watch tournaments on Twitch or on Youtube I see the game has crystal clear quality, and it looks really good. How do they achieve that kind of quality? Can I do it only by using Composite cables and the Elgato HD? Is there another (better) way of capturing Melee footage?Thanks for your time and for answering!
2ax8s4	-30215	1405567970	smashbros	Advice for hosting a tourney	I'm not from america, and in my country we don't have weekly or monthly tourneys or big events were Smash is playable. Smash is commonly seen as a fun casual game but nothing else. Me and my friends play competitive Melee and Project M, but we are sure we cannot be the only ones. That's why we want to start a Tourney to see how many players we can find to start a community of competitive players.However, I don't have an idea of were to begin. I was thinking about making our tourney in a house, with some TVs and Cubes/Wiis for friendlies, and a main TV for the tourney matches. We could even stream it and everything. It would be all very amateur but very fun.The thing is, do you think  that's a good idea? What other things should I consider?
2cpzu1	-30215	1407270604	SSBPM	Adding more costumes/textures to characters?	So my question is: When using the Brawl Costume Manager to add textures to the characters, I have noticed that many of them have some files (Ex. FitSnake09) but it is completely empty. No portrait, no character texture or CSS image. Is there a way to make those empty slots usable? Can I have like 10 costumes for characters (Ex. Snake) instead of the 6 the game comes with?
2d4w6e	-30215	1407660827	SSBPM	About Dr. Mario's Textures...	I am currently making my custom build.The thing is, I wanted to change Mario's Textures with some new ones I've downloaded, but whenever I replace Dr. Mario's Textures (Ex. FitMario08.pac/pcs) Mario still uses pills, electric effects and instead of his cape he uses FLUDD to reflect things, and it really looks ugly. Is Project M always going to have the Dr. Mario effects for Mario's Slots 07 through 11?Also, I tried using cBliss to make him only have 7 costumes but the game forced me to have 10 by default. Is there a way to reduce that number?
2ef1ft	-30215	1408850715	SSBPM	Adding Custom CSS/SSS Background (Logo/Icon)	I'm making my own Custom Build. So far it's going great, but I also wanted to add a custom Background Image on the Character Select Screen and also add an Image with Striking Stages Instructions (Like the one that is present in Xanadu where it shows in which order to strike and how many bans are available)How can I do that? I have Brawl Box and I know how to use it pretty well, but do I need something else?Also, I have already tried downloading pre-made "common5" files from the web. They have worked for me, but the thing is:1.- When I try to Export/Import the background file from the pre-made common5 to my own, it doesn't show any background at all. I guess only adding the texture isn't enough.2.- The only reason I don't use the pre-made common5 is because I have edited all my CSPs with color bars, and for some reason, whenever I change my common5 with another, the character names end up covering the color bars and it doesn't look good at all. Is there a reason for that? My actual common5 shows character names ABOVE the color bars. Any other common5 file shows the names in front of the color bars.So any help would be really appreciated. Thanks in advance!
2f2ykq	-30215	1409492477	SSBPM	Editing my common5 file to correctly display color bars &amp; trying to manually add custom CSS/SSS Backgrounds	I downloaded a build some time ago. That build included a common5 file and CSPs for every character. Those CSPs had color bars, and I thought they looked amazing so I planned to keep them. Now everytime I edit some new CSPs I add the color bars.The thing is, I wanted to add my own background for CSS and SSS, (the CSS one showing my logo and the title of my custom build/the SSS one to show striking order and bans) and I downloaded a pre-made common5 file that only required me to replace the .png file in there to have my own CSS and SSS backgrounds respectively. However, now the character names were OVER the color bars, blocking them completely, for some reason.So why does this happen? Why does one common5 file has the character names over the color bars and the other completely blocks them? Also, is there another way to MANUALLY add a custom CSS and SSS background? That way I wouldn't have to edit my original common5 (which is heavily edited already)
2f8knl	-30215	1409639272	SSBPM	About editing FitMario.pac File	I am currently trying to edit my FitMario.pac file. The reason being that whenever I change any of Dr. Mario's textures with a custom texture, it still uses pills, has the electric f-smash and for some weird reason, the cape is replaced by a FLUDD texture (the model of FLUDD is used, but it keeps the same effects as regular cape)I would like to use more outfits for Mario than 5 recolors of Dr. Mario so if anyone has an idea of which things am I supposed to edit in FitMario.pac file to:1. Remove pills and restore the fireballs2. Restore the fire atribute f-smash3. Restoring the cape and not having a dead FLUDD as my side-bI would really appreciate the help.

That disjointed hitbox of his sword really limits my possibilities of getting close or inflicting damage as he can cancel my approach and hit me instead with just tilts and jabs. Also would like some tips for recovery and getting back to the stage.
2itui3	-30215	1412915714	smashbros	Streaming hardware advice	Hey so I wanted to start streaming and covering some local weekly tourneys, but adding a lot more quality than the one my current setup can give. With that said, I need advice for choosing the best possible webcam to record players and myself as I comment the matches, and also a good headset that can nullify exterior noise and have good audio quality. Also, remember that the cheaper the better. Please keep in mind that I have a capture device to record gameplay (mainly Melee and Project M, not 3DS)If you could give me the names of the products and their respective price range, as well as some descriptions to explain why they are the best options, I will really appreciate it.Thanks in advance!Edit: Ok so please, the webcam is to record PLAYERS and COMMENTATORS. Not the gameplay. I have a capture device for that.
2k61lr	-30215	1414123954	smashbros	About Stage Builder and Legal Tourney Stages...	I was thinking, since many stages are way too big or just too gimmicky, what's the overall opinion on manually creating stages like PM's Pokemon Stadium 2, Yoshi Story (Melee) and things of the sort? The rest of the community can simply download a specific stage and be ready to battle on it when attending a tournament.With this I'm not trying to say that Smash Wii U stages are bad or that we don't have enough balanced stages. I'm just asking for opinions and ideas of how we could integrate things like Stage Builder to the competitive scene.

Some time ago I covered a local tournament and used my Elgato Game Capture HD to record matches (directly from the Elgato Game Capture HD Software) and it was all recorded in 60 FPS. However, whenever I try to record 60 FPS Melee Footage, the software tells me both Input and Output are: 720x480i -&gt; 59.94/97 (can't remember exactly) and the preview is in 60 FPS, but when I check the Output video it's on 30 FPS.I'm trying to upload content to YouTube now that it supports 60 FPS video but i can't figure out why exactly I cannot record 60 FPS Melee footage now when I could before.Any Elgato Game Capture HD owners or Melee Content Creators that know something about the topic? Help would be greatly appreciated.
2rtaeu	-30215	1420769950	speedrun	Best Capture Card for PS1 streaming?	I want to start speedrunning PS1 games, but I want to stream my runs for others to see. I want a capture card that can work with OBS, has little to no delay between what I play and what is shown and that can display the gameplay with good/high quality.I have an Elgato Game Capture HD, and that works well for local recordings, but the problem with that thing is that, for streaming, it doesn't work very well since it has a delay (aproximately 2 seconds, but it can vary) between what I play and what is displayed on the PC, and on the stream. So, my commentary and my camera are 2 seconds ahead of what viewers can actually see. And yes, I know you can delay your mic and your camera with OBS, but it's not a perfect sync and it doesn't feel natural at all, and I don't like that.So please, any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

It's not actually the video I'm interested in, but the music from that video. I remember the author of the track being called something along the lines of "NES the creator" and it was a song of around 2 minutes.Anyway, the video is very dark and dramatic and it shows the cast commiting suicide murdering each other, drinking till passing out and doing drugs. It was like "the dark side of TF2" and the video, together with the song which name or author I can't remember was very strong and amazing.I now want to listen to the full album of that guy again, but I just can't remember his name! I knew that finding the video would be my best chance to hear the music again and then track the composer, but I just can't, it's too hard.Any help is appreciated.

3gen1l	-30215	1439166269	splatoon	Regarding Splatfest "Popularity" and all the hate surrounding it	Probably a topic many of you might be bored to see on the Sub, but I have read a lot of comments saying that Popularity sucks, and it's unfair because it doesn't test the players skill and other arguments. I'm here to try and give you reasons to notice how Popularity actually is kind of a big deal and that it is not as unbalanced and unfair as you might think. 1. First of all, let's start by talking about Splatfests. What's the main reason that makes these events as big and as exciting as they are in the first place? Preference. You get to CHOOSE the topic you like the most and defend it against the other team's preference. You battle it out based on what you LIKE. Imagine if the game randomly chose half the total number of players for "Team A" and half the other players for "Team B", and then the only thing they tell you is "Win as many battles as you can as a team, win prizes"... That's exactly the same team you do on Vanilla Online Servers, wether it is Ranked Battle or just Friendlies. Oh, you don't like how the letter A looks? Well sorry, you don't get to choose. Just play, just show me how good you are. Sounds boring, right?2. Also, keep in mind that being the most popular team also has it's downside. Take Mallows Vs. Hot Dogs for example. I was on Team Mallow, and most of my battles were against other Mallows... Battles which don't count for the final results of the Splatfest at all. While Hot Dogs were easily finding matches against Mallows (either getting Rekt or Owning us) those were battles that actually counted. Most of Team Mallow was wasting their time killing themselves than actually fighting the rival team and getting wins for their team.3. Having more players on the team doesn't necessarily means a good thing. Being the popular one means that more people, bad and good players, are on it. There are more chances you will be paired with starting or novice players on a team that randomizes 400 players than a team which randomizes only 100. 4. Finally, how exactly are battles not so important? They are multiplied by 4 at the end of the event (Previously by 2) Obviously Nintendo thought that maybe multiplying the win rate percentage by 2 was not giving enough credit to players' skill, so they made it so win rate percentages would be multiplied by 4 instead. Keep into consideration that you still need to best the oposing team on the battlefield, but it makes things easier for the team that lost in the populatiry category to make a comeback. It happened with Roller Coasters, so it's a thing that it's confirmed to work.You want to win the Splatfest? You want your battles to count? Then start getting wins instead of complaining. You are getting owned? Step up your game! Stop complaining about your team, or popularity. Start acknowledging your weaknesses, knowing which things you need to improve in order to be more efficient and win more battles for your team. If you want battles to count, then you should always be looking forward to OBLITERATING the oposing team.That's my opinion at least. Splatfests are events that are supposed to be fun. Even if your team loses, if you were good enough to reach King Rank, you will get 18 Super Sea Snails. If you didn't get a thing, not even a "Thank you for participating" message, I would actually think that all the hate is well deserved. But everyone is a winner at the end. It doesn't matter if your team was destroyed or if you won, the game rewards the player and their efforts, and that's the thing people are missing.I love the game, I love the community and I love the fact that people are seriously enjoying this game and that a competitive scene is developing behind it. I just wanted to share my thoughts. It's just an OPINION people, no need to get downvoted or insulted in the comments (although probably I will because of the rules of posting an unpopular opinion on the internet)Either way, no hate and no hard feelings for anyone.Thanks for reading this long piece of text, and sorry if some parts are incorrent, English is not my first language.TL;DR: Splatfests are based on preferences and being the popular team also carry bad things behind it. So instead of complaining, have fun, enjoy the game, try to improve and help your team, and enjoy the rewards the game gives you for being a good player, rather than not getting anything because your team lost.

Anyone have suggestions of different sites or ways to stop at least those videos from appearing? I've had a lot of trouble finding more hardcore content without those sorts of advertisements.

Or, as Liz Lemon would say, WUCK?!	Last night, with no prior indication, my boyfriend of a year broke up with me. We hadn't been fighting at all and I thought things were going well. He said he was tired of being a boyfriend. I've always considered myself low maintenance. I don't like talking on the phone much or need much support from anyone. Then he said something that made me furious. He told me he feels the reason he'd stayed with me for the past few months is that he felt possessive. He said he didn't want to see me with someone else and didn't want anyone else to have me. Now, evolutionary psychology wise, this makes some modicum of sense. I just cannot believe someone would continue dating someone for that reason. I guess I just came here to say WTFuck. It's one of the most hurtful things anyone has ever said to me. Worse, it made me, as a woman, feel terrible.

I should be mad but I am laughing too hard. We both passed out. I wake up to him standing in the corner of my room peeing. Turns out he is sleep-walking. He stumbles back to my bed, pushes me aside and falls asleep where I had been. He will not wake up for anything, I pinched him and hit him---nothing. His phone starts to ring a lot and it is his ex-girlfriend. He told me that though she still lives in his house they are no longer together. It's a recent break-up and I've only been casually seeing him, so I consider it a non-issue/ his problem. His phone continues to ring. He continues to not wake up despite multiple attempts on my part to say, "Hey tool-bag, your ex is calling," combined with some mild physical violence (gotta take out the aggression for him peeing on my Jimmy Choos) I place the phone next to his head and decide to call him. Interestingly, his phone says "Paul F." is calling. I leave a voicemail. He finally wakes up. I decide to tell him he peed in my room and that my name is not Paul, as his (maybe not such an ex) girlfriend likely thinks. He leaves, very embarrassed and texts me an apology saying "Hey _____, I'm so sorry." I replied, "My name is Paul goddammit." Safe to say. I think I'm going to happily stay forever alone. Just wanted to make other single ladies feel better/feel that not having a person in their bed is sometimes for the best.

Before you begin there are some programs that you need and I will explain what they do.GPU overclocking utility - The Program that you actually overclock your card with. There is one from just about every GPU manufacturer. Here are some recommended ones.  [MSI Afterburner](http://event.msi.com/vga/afterburner/download.htm) - The go to for most people simple and offers great information and monitoring as well as an included stress test. (Kombustor)[EVGA Precision X](http://www.evga.com/precision/) - Looks cool and simple to use.[Sapphire Trixx](https://www.sapphireselectclub.com/ssc/TriXX/) - Occasionally a utility will cap out your GPU but you want to push it further. Many have had luck bypassing this cap by using Trixx. However it is known to occasionally have problems with maintaining a stable voltage. Edit: [Here's] (http://forums.guru3d.com/showthread.php?t=370201)  a way to bypass those limits in afterburner. GPU Monitoring Software- Let's you know information on your GPU such as clock rate and voltage.[GPU-Z](http://www.techpowerup.com/gpuz/) The go to for monitoring your GPU. Offers detailed information about your card in a simple looking format.[MSI Afterburner](http://event.msi.com/vga/afterburner/download.htm) - MSI afterburner offers pretty great graphs for monitoring usage, temperature and clock speeds. Stress testing and benchmarking software.[MSI Kombustor](http://event.msi.com/vga/afterburner/download.htm) - Included in the MSI Afterburner download is MSI Kombustor. It offers a wide array of tests and is considered good for testing maximum heat and stability under load.[Unigine Heaven 3.0](http://unigine.com/products/heaven/) - a DX11 benchmark that simulates a fantasy town. Good for seeing the performance impact of your overclocks and stability if left for a while. [Furmark](http://www.ozone3d.net/benchmarks/fur/) - Furmark is an open GL benchmark known for making GPUs run about as hot as they will ever get. Good for checking to see if your temps are too high.Now that software is out of the way I can begin the meat of the guide. First thing's first find some information about your card. It's a good idea to look around places like [Overclock.net](http://www.overclock.net/) to see what most people can get out of the card you have. This also let's you know about what kind of temperatures you should expect. I personally prefer to not go above 70 C for temperature but some cards just run hot and can take it.Second is that while seeing what other people can get is great it is not a guarantee that you will attain such overclocks. Some GPUs simply overclock well and other simply do not. Even within the same series for example two 7870s can have radically different results for overclocking because of the nature of working with silicon. Now that you've (hopefully) got the information you need we can start overclocking. 1. Open up whatever utility you decided to use. For this guide I will be using MSI afterburner.2. Now that you are in whatever utility you have decided to use I can begin to explain the aspects of it using [this image.](http://i.imgur.com/Ehhcgmr.png) First circled in black is your GPU information. This will tell your what series your GPU is as well as what driver version you are using. Next highlighted in the sickly yellow is your core clock. This is the most important when it comes to overclocking your GPU as it will provide the biggest performance increases. Next in red is your memory clock this affects how fast the GPU's RAM is running. Many don't see the value in overclocking this as it provides often little performance increases. Finally in blue is your fan speed which is exactly what it sounds like. It's simply how fast your GPU fan is currently running.1. Now it is time to actually get to the overclocking. Move the sliders or type in the new clock values you wish to input. It is generally recommended to do this in 20mhz steps for the core clock and 10mhz steps on the memory. After you input these new values hit apply and run either MSI Kombustor or Furmark while keeping either GPU-Z or MSI Afterburner open to keep an eye on your temps. Run your program of choice @ 1920 X 1080 or 1920 X 1200 for about 5 minutes. If your did not see any strange shapes or glitches (referred  to as Artifacts) then you can raise it another 20mhz or so on until you do not like your temperature or you begin to see artifacts. If this does happen simply end whatever test you are doing and scale back your clocks. Now that you have a clock that you think is stable fire up Unigine Heaven and run the benchmark at maximum settings. (Tessalation - Extreme, Anisotropy - 16X, Anti Aliasing -8X) After you run the benchmark leave Heaven open for about 2 hours. (You should stay near your computer.) If no BSODs or other failures happen then congratulations you have most likely achieved a stable overclock. Now you should go and try the greatest stability test of them all, a game you play regularly. Play the game for a while (again I do 2 hours) and if you notice no artifacts or catastrophic failures then your clock is considered stable.1.  Now some of you may be asking if you can push your GPU further than this. The answer is probably. If you go back to afterburner or your utility you should see something similar to what I have encircled in blue [here.](http://i.imgur.com/WeYZTXV.png) This is voltage and power limit. These affect how much electricity is being given to your GPU. They will also often have to be unlocked in the settings of the utility you are using. While this allows for higher stable clocks it also means more heat and if you raise the voltage too much it can fry your GPU. While the risk of frying your GPU is often low it can happen if you are careless about it. Always remember to overclock at your own risk and within some sort of guideline. No two cards are alike and temperatures vary from manufacturer model to model. Remember be safe and happy overclocking!If you want further help and resources on over clocking you can check out these sites.

Hope you learned something helpful from this guide.EDIT: I'm from the good old USA

1a89st	-30253	1363198792	buildapc	[PSA] For those who put their towers in a desk slot don't trust manufacturer measurements  	Ok so I recently bought a carbide 400r from Corsair to put into my new buiild. The manufacturer measurements are 19.8" high, 20.5" long, and 8.1" wide. Now seeing this I bought the case because from those measurements I would think that it would fit in my desk. What was neglected is the fact that the side panel's bulges are not included in the measurement as I had assumed. Meaning that I in fact can't fit the case in my desk. Now i'm going to have to return it and am probably going to pick up a new case. On that note anyone know of a nice case under 9in wide?TL;DR Measure the case in a store if you can if you have limited space for it.

Currently I have it set to 1.425V in the bios yet CPU-Z/hardware monitor are reading it as 1.44V. I have Load line calibration set to extreme yet the issue still persists. Any ideas?

1brl47	-30253	1365203751	hardware	So some people seem to be rather confused on AMDs APU and CPU naming scheme so i'll break it down here.	So hanging around tech forums and subreddits I've seen people question AMDs naming scheme a lot of the time. Things like "Why are new APUs called Trinity?" etc. Let me start by saying this is all conjecture and should be taken as such.First we have the first generation APUs or "Llano". These are named after the Llano river in Texas, a river located near the center of the state that runs through the city of the same name and also a tributary to Texas's longest river the Colorado. Next we have 2nd gen APUs or "Trinity". This one took me a while myself but I realized the answer was right outside my door. Trinity is named after the north Texas Trinity river. Being the one of the longer rivers in Texas and running through the city of Dallas and Fort worth.  From this Richland (Planned gen 3 APU) appears to be named after the deceptively named Richland creek yet another Texan river. This time a tributary to the Trinity river. On the low power/Mobile side of things we have Brazos named after the central Texan Brazos river.   Now with Kaveri (Gen 4) and the switch from "Bulldozer" cores to "Steamroller" cores we have the Kaveri river of India which is a very long river flowing across the middle of the nation. Starting to see a pattern?Now we have AMDs mainstream FX series. With the first gen "Bulldozer" CPUs we have "Zambezi" named after the Zambezi river the fourth longest river in the continent of Africa and home to Angel Falls. It runs through Angola, Zambia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique. Next we have Vishera most likely named after the Russian river which flows off of the Kama river which itself flows off off the Volga river. Now this all may or may be not be true. I don't work for AMD and don't know for sure but these all seem rather likely that AMD is naming all FX and APU series after rivers.TL;DR: Rivers

Was listening to music on shuffle today when I heard [this arrange] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnPnWGMdOPE) pop up. It took my breath away from the beginning and ran with it. After it ended all I had was an audible "whoa"  It just all fit together perfectly for me. Never thought I could choose a favorite from all the great music out there but this just feels right. It feels like I can finally call a favorite. Anyone else finally find their favorites?

Said I would do it in [Seiga Kaku's](http://www.reddit.com/r/touhou/comments/1ciykt/i_tried_pixelling_td_characters_for_the_flairs/) thread and I did. [Kasen Sprite]( http://i.imgur.com/SCJuT2q.png) I personally think it came out pretty well. I started with a Komachi sprite and just did a bit of trimming and recolouring (mainly on the dress.)  Kosuzu was similar but I don't think I got the right shade of yellow for the bells or the dress. It looks fine in GIMP but really a bit "mustard" like when exported. The sleeves do have a checker it's just not very visible against the yellow.  [Kosuzu Sprite 1 "Mustard"](http://i.imgur.com/jilewMD.png) So I made an alt one with a lighter yellow [Alt Kosuzu](http://i.imgur.com/71CFpFV.png).If either one works then I'm fine. I think that should round out all the characters from windows era.

1ii8c4	-30253	1374089138	MechanicalKeyboards	Just got into the mech game and decide to write about my experience so far.	Starting off obligatory album of [pictures of my keyboard.](http://imgur.com/a/FOqmT) Now onto the review.Starting off when i took it out of the box the first the thing I happened to notice about my QFR was the weight. The heavy feeling from having so many switches made seem really nice and sturdy as well as eliminate any worries about my keyboard sliding around. The black finish on the board looks nice and while I'm not a fan of the font used on the keycaps the board seemed to look good overall. (Excepting that 1337 G5M3R font).Moving onto the switches themselves MX brown feels lighter to type on than most rubber domes (in terms of how hard I felt I had to press) while still feeling nice and solid with no mushiness whatsoever. Now the tactile bump that you get with MX Brown isn't nearly as large as I had expected. It's there but it's very light. If I hadn't known there was a bump i could have confused it for just bottoming out the key. I'm still happy with the bump and it makes the switches rather silent if i don't bottom out. (Compared to most rubber domes I've used) Overall i'm very happy with my purchase and will see myself taking this anywhere where a keyboard is needed.

So i'm sure you guys have seen the sticky post about the Soku and PoFV tourney being planned right now. So i've decided to make a game night for those of us who play things other than touhou! Starting off nothing is absolutely set in stone yet and can change. Feel free to object and ask for changes in the comments! Now onto games that I feel would suit this well.1. [Assault Cube](http://sourceforge.net/projects/actiongame/) - Now starting off we have a simple shooter that's incredibly easy to run for those of you on older systems that can't handle games very well. It's not the greatest game but it's good for simple fun. it's also open source software and compatible with OSX and linux kernel based OSs. There's many servers to choose from and most stay empty and available for us to use.2. Team Fortress 2 - I'm sure y'all know what this is. The big bertha of free to play games. Choose a class and get going. Also available on OSX and you can get it working on most linux distros. 1. Minecraft - another game that i'm sure y'all are familiar with. There are touhou themed servers outhere and i'm sure at least a few of y'all have some recommendations on where to play. 1. Battlefield 3: Current top dog for competitive shooters in the PC space.  Just started a /r/touhou platoon. Just search for /r/touhou. Please feel free to give suggestions for more games and ways to get things coordinated. I'm hoping we can use the teamwau server that /u/fauxm hosts but it might end up not being able to handle everyone that wants to play.Lastly here's my info on gaming and communication services.Origin: Wolfram2Steam: Wolfram / Commie\#touhou IRC on esper.net: WolframSkype: Wolfram (Cirno pic and in Texas)

1ti1h8	-30253	1387765856	dogecoin	Gentoomen pool is going down forever	Here's the text The post is up on the main page.&gt; I'm sad to announce that the Gentoomen doge pool will be taken offline permanently.&gt; &gt; As you've probably noticed, the pool has been incredibly unreliable for the last week or so. Our web frontend being down became the rule rather than the exception, user payouts had to be put on hold for hours on end, statistics were often wildly inaccurate, etc.&gt; &gt; After spending a sizeable amount of money on a new and improved infrastructure for the pool, we had high hopes of our performance issues disappearing. It turned out throwing hardware at the problem wasn't going to fix a thing, and within 2 hours we were back to where we started.&gt; &gt; We made the decision to shut down the pool after yet another issue with user payouts was discovered. We decided that the amount of work required to sustain operation would be too large, and as such we shut down stratum effective immediately.&gt; &gt; The web frontend will remain functional until 23:59 UTC the 24th of December 2013, after that no further payouts will be processed.&gt; &gt; The missing payouts from the last hours are being processed right now, and should be finished within an hour or two.&gt; &gt; Best regards,&gt; &gt; The Gentoomen pool operators

1tq7sr	-30253	1388046854	headphones	Got some SE215s for christmas and here are some initial impressions	Starting off my point of reference for most things will be my sturdy ol 280s since they occupy the same 100 US price point.Songs Used: http://pastebin.com/vc7tFG8XComfort: I have to say initially they were not very comfortable. The shells didn't really fit well in my ears but after changing tips and leaving them in for a bit they just sorta blended in. The memory was not an issue for me coming from a daily use Meelec M6 but was initially rather stiff.Build: As you'll see anyone else say the swinging cables are a bit worrying but i enjoy them as it makes it easier to insert them comfortably. The connecters and strain reliefs are all nice and thick and they definitely feel built to last.Isolation: If you use the olives it's just you and your music. Great isolation and great for getting away from the world. The silicone tips remove quite a bit of isolation but not so much that it distracts from what you're listening to. Sound:Sub-bass: It's just sorta there. No big feel and standout here. There's no feeling in your chest compared to my 280s it's not much to look at but then again the sub-bass is the 280s strong point. Fans of UK dubstep will be disappointed here I'm afraid.Bass: It has punch and most certainly feels better compared the anemic 280. Mid-bass stands out on brostep and hiphop and is nice and has good attack. Mids: The mids feel pretty warm overall. Fairly nice and crisp. They keep pace well with the bass and tend not to be overwhelmed by the bass. Highs: The highs are where things tend to fizzle a bit. Compared the bass and the mids the highs get drowned a bit and it gets colder and colder the farther you go from the mids. it's not *bad*it's just not as good as everything else. I'd personally be fine with calling the mids just slightly above average. (Call it a 5.5/10 if 5 is the average)Soundstage: It feels wider than my HD 280 (not that being wider than the hd280 is a difficult task). I personally like it's wideness and it feels good while listening to EDM when there's a lot going on at once. Wrap up: If you're looking for something with a decent bass end that doesn't smash the rest of the spectrum and don't mind highs that aren't up to snuff the SE215 provides a great experience. However with the A161P being found for ~65 USD new i can't give the SE215s a value crown like they have earned in many other places. I'd still give it a solid recommendation however.. If you prefer your IEMs with a side of bass and a good soundstage the SE215 is a good choice to consider.TL;DR OK Sub-Bass, Good bass and mids and very slightly above average highs. Fun to listen to. Worthy of consideration

There's a few templates but you can put whatever you need to in the box. Also users bring posts in violation of the rules to our attention. The report button gives us a helpful modmail message. Let's all keep everyone happy down here. Have a nice day.

2bnci4	-30253	1406248561	stunfisk	Could I get some input on this group vs. group meta idea I've been mulling over please?	The basic idea here comes from [Crew Battles](http://www.ssbwiki.com/Crew_battle) in Super Smash Bros. Melee.* Each player has a set amount of pokemon to start off with. * A tier will be chosen beforehand and players must adhere to Smogon singles rules for the tier chosen. * All teams are submitted before the first match along with crew order.* The winner of an individual match will proceed to go against the next member of the crew with the pokemon which did not faint in the previous match. * The first crew to have all of it's members defeated loses.Any input or criticisms would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

I'll pass on the jist of what I've gathered./u/spez made a post to /r/announcements about some new actions and after being asked what the actions were he posted this. Note the mention of "animated CP". You can follow up on the response to that. Comments specifically concerning animated CP is a few posts down in the comment tree.&gt;The actual policy on animated CP can be found as follows. From the Content Policy Page, you need to click on "involuntary pornography" which takes you here.&gt;If you're interested in reading about the actual legal status of "animated CP" I guess a starting point might be this post in the announcement thread. The impression I'm getting is that "its legal, because nobody's making a solid ruling on the subject".&gt;I know /r/loli and /r/pomf have been shut down thus far. from /u/Imosa1

2e0f71	-30268	1408476403	Criminology	Criminology Podcasts	Hello Criminologists! I've noticed a lack of podcast discussion in this subreddit, so to amend that I shall take it upon myself to provide a reference in podcasts to check out! A problem with Criminology is that there is not a subculture of "Pop Criminology" (as there is Pop Science), so to supplement the academics, I've also included some social science podcasts that are not so crime-focused, but do have crime topics. Well without further ado:*Academic Criminology** **NW-SCC CRJ208 - Introduction to Criminology Distance Education**. This is a video lecture featuring seventeen episodes of 50-minute segments that teaches the basics of Criminology. Features a lecturer and powerpoint slides.*Criminology/Criminal Justice Discussions &amp; Pop Crime** **Criminal Justice Discussions with David Onek**. Every episode of this podcasts features guest speakers who hold conversations on relevant Criminal Justice topics. Examples of such guest speakers are police chiefs, a professor of the Berkeley law school, the president of the NAACP, etc.* **Criminal Justice Research Podcast from the National Institute of Justice**. This podcast from the NIJ features numerous brief discussions (usually under 10 minutes) on research and new improvements of the criminal justice system.* **SAGE Criminology**. Features authors who have written articles that deal with Criminology and has them discuss their articles. Every episode features a different author and provides a diverse collection of issues or improvements in the CJS.* **UCT Centre of Criminology**. Features lectures, interviews, and discussions on criminological topics with a variety of guest speakers.* **Inside the FBI**. Discusses some of the most interesting cases handled by the FBI, including scams, murders, white collar corruption, and gangs. This podcast provides the community insight into what the FBI does, such as how they investigate or how they apprehend criminals. * **Its a Crime With Margaret McLean**. Every episode is around 1 hour 36 minutes long with a variety of topics including: serial killers, organizational crime, interviews with former police, conspiracies, psychics, popular crime trials, forensics, movies, and far more.*Social Science Discussions** **Social Science Bites**. Has some discussions on criminology, inequality, disgust (deviance?), death, morality, and behavioral studies.* **Thinking Allowed**. Provides many discussions of crime, criminology, and inequality in numerous episodes. This podcast is *expansive*. There are so many topics that fall under social science and so many episodes here that it would be difficult to find this podcast uninteresting.Well, that's all I got! Please recommend anything that I might have missed!

Languages that use characters (Mandarin, Kanji-Japanese) convey a word in as little as 1 character. This effectively makes it so that more words can be contained on 1 line and convey dense pieces of information rapidly. Now I'm not saying that Dutch should adopt a character system or that vowel-collapsing will make everyone super-readers. The shaving off of 1 vowel will not make a difference on its own, but with the prevalence of double vowels in the Dutch language, it will add up.

37f6dl	-30268	1432700908	solresol	Shorthand that I use	The syllables remind me of Japanese because of the consonant-vowel pairing, so I based a shorthand script off of the Kana system.Do	**∘**Re	**フ**Mi	**^**Fa	**ℓ**Sol	**そ**La	**ノ**Si	**ʒ**The syllables are basically the building blocks of the words and are unchanging, so it felt like a chore to write 2-3 letters for what could be represented by one. Maybe this really isn't much of a problem due to the abbreviation system, but I kind of want something that actually looks like a language. Something naturalistic and simple.I know that Solresol already has a stenographic script, but I'm not a fan. The circle, half-circles, and lines all seem a bit too geometric and seems too artificial. It does have the advantage of distinguishing one word from another by shape alone, but I digress.Here is an example of my shorthand:**La fadofasol faremi dofasôlmi** becomes **ノ  ℓ∘ℓそ  ℓフ^  ∘ℓそ^ .**It probable doesn't look quite that appealing online (I had to pull similar characters from Katakana, Hirigana, Greek, and alternate English scripts to post this), but I find that it looks nice when handwritten.
38h905	-30268	1433393876	conlangs	Dutch-derived Nordlang	I like to butcher languages in my free time, so recently I've started messing around with Dutch. I wanted to see what it would sound like if it were Scandinavian, so I influenced it with Swedish to begin the mutation. I started this project today and so far I have a word-base of ~600 words; probably enough that I suppose I could show it off and receive criticism.Let me tell you a story about my dog:&gt;Min honda zijna van ên ouda verelda. E krijga et honda langa gelenda vên E zijna mâr ên kinda. E noijt vervachtat dat E zou hâlat ên huisdiera, mâr E doat. Et honda zijnat vôr verkôpa en E zijnat endast bezoeka vên et honda zittat pa min ronda. Het lijka dat et honda kiesat me.English:&gt;My dog was from an old world. I got the dog long ago when I was only a kid. I never expected that I would receive a dog, but I did. The dog was for sale and I was only visiting when the dog sat on my lap. It seems that the dog chose me.Right now the language is nothing but a Nordlang creole, but I plan to distinguish it... somehow. I've considered adding Japanese vocabulary (mostly adjectives) to the language, because Swedish and Japanese seem to really go well together. Maybe once that is settled, I could consider playing around with the suffixes, roots, and prefixes from the three language and create new words. Grammar and spelling is really experimental.A brief rundown of the grammar displayed in the example:Ik -&gt; E. Kind of got the idea from Afrikaans that pronouns should be simplified, so in addition to E, there are Je (you), He (he), Se (she), Ve (we), Ze (they). The different forms of "you" was a nuisance and she/they (zij/ze) was bothersome. While you are not likely to spot the difference between a spoken *Se* and a spoken *Ze*, on paper it makes reading smoother.Zijna: to be. This is the infinitive, imperative, and present indicative form of the word. The indicative present is Zijnat. Notice how like Swedish the verb does not change depending on the subject. So simple. To "create" the verbs, I use the present/imperative form of the verb and add -a. Most verbs are originally Dutch, only a few are Swedish in origin.Een -&gt; ên. The accent signifies that the long-vowel sound should be used. I'm just playing around with this for a bit. If it does stay, it would only be in use for professional writing (books, essays, websites). In the future, I may add some of the Norse's favorite letters such as å, ø, etc. But then again, maybe not.I also added -a's to every noun. I do not know why.

39elh3	-30268	1434000276	books	Does anyone have a list of books and musicians mentioned in Haruki Murakami's books?	I've previously read *Kafka on the Shore* and am almost through with *Norweigan Wood* and I notice that Murakami really has an interesting narrow taste in media. The books he mentions always seem to be classics or books written by authors who've written classics. What I find interesting are that some are foreign and other are just lesser-known. As for the music, it's always classical. If no list exists, I can mention a few that I remember:KotS: Bach (I think), *Metamorphosis* by Kafka, *In the Penal Colony* by Kafka.NW: Bach on guitar, The Beatles, *The Great Gatsby* by Fitzgerald, *Das Kapital* by Marx, *Beneath the Wheel* by Hermann Hesse.Unfortunately I am shit at remembering names, so I don't remember any musicians other than a few obvious ones.

Very rarely do I go to a store on the day that a book is released, because generally I am not hyping myself up for new books.Maybe the cause is that I use Gutenberg for downloading ebooks that are within the public domain. I've found that there's a wealth of knowledge to be had there, so much so that I do not need to be current with new releases. I prefer to read philosophy, pulp mysteries, and classical literature; most of which has an enormous library in the public domain.I'm also never up to date with movies and tv shows, but this may be a symptom of my chronic reading and my lack of TV.What about you?

They are not the same, are they?I would say that they are two fields closely related, but with very different types of people.Occultists: people who read dusty books (or pdfs nowadays) to gain insight into mystical powers and rituals; those that invoke and commune with spirits.Paranormal: monster-hunters intent on proving that ghosts, aliens, demons are real and share personal stories of encounters with the supernatural.Edit: Another take on this is that the occult is internal and the paranormal is external. What I mean by this is that the occult is basically knowledge, knowledge that deals with the supernatural, mystical, or magical. The truths arise internally as you read and practice what you've learned. In contrast, people who seek the paranormal are often looking for beings in their domain. They enter a haunted house in search of ghosts, forests reputed to have navajo witches, or locations of ufo sitings. They are not inducing these events as a manifestation of their will (at least not consciously), but rather seeking those that are already occurring.
3bla6t	-30268	1435635137	witchcraft	One-word spells?	It seems that most spells come in rhyme and verse and I understand that it is to aid in concentration/visualization of the desires of the magic user.However, in fiction magic is overwhelmingly presented as a one-worded affair. I can understand the appeal, for one it shortens casting time and also words that are magical in themselves are kickass. Perhaps because of the fictional setting magic is just a lot more convenient, you can just go all gung-ho on magic with little visualization or practice.So my question is is could we borrow an element from the world of fiction and produce our own one-worded spells?If it were feasible, would it be advanced? It seems to me that it would require a great deal of experience to have the will and visualization techniques to master a quick one-worded spell.I was also thinking of abbreviation. Hebrew has this form of abbreviation where one can create pseudo-words from names or things, for example:&gt;Tanakh (TNK) = **T**orah + **N**eviim + **K**etuvim.In this way, one could first master the poetic form of a spell in its entirety and later reduce it to 1-10 words through abbreviation.
3bn2zd	-30268	1435678019	occult	Brujeria: Mexican Witchcraft	So I decided to look up Latin American witchcraft to see what take our neighbors from down under have on it and stumbled upon Brujeria. *Brujeria* literally means *witchcraft* in Spanish where its practitioners are *brujos* or *brujas*. *Hechizos* are what they call their spells and can mean *home-made* or *magic spells*.In some cultures, brujas are synonymous with the Navajo *skinwalker* or *goatman*, aka evil witches who can shapeshift into animals, spiritually possess, and spy on potential victims. [Source](http://www.unexplainedstuff.com/Magic-and-Sorcery/The-Practice-of-Brujeria.html)If someone warns you about evil brujas, skinwalkers, or goatmen, I would take their warnings to heart. I've heard stories both online and from Navajo Indian friends and you do not want to associate yourself with those evils, nor should you consciously wish to seek them out. Scary shit.Then there is the different telling of brujas that is very in line with modern day neo-paganism/magicalism(?). Basically you have your *brujas blancas* and *brujas negros* which seem like an old conception of the witchcraft tradition (as modern witches would most likely tell you that magic has no color). These brujas are a lot more boring, because they have your basic *hechizos de amor*, *hechizos de dinero*, *hechizos de proteccion*, etc. Spells come with instructions such as the usual incantations, candles, and sometimes moon phases. Some brujerias also employ the use of voodoo/hoodoo, astrology, herbalism, etc. [This website was one of the first that I found that listed hechizos](http://www.hechizos.info/)Not that these brujas are not without flair. As you would expect there are hints of Mexican tradition stemming from native tradition. For instance, there is the Mexican Goddess of Death, *Santa Muerte* or *Santisima Muerte* or *Mictecacihuatl*. [There's quite a bit of history on this figure available here](http://www.brujonegrobrujeria.com/page/page/2215114.htm).Due to the great presence of Christianity in Mexican culture, there is also quite a bit of mysticism surrounding saint figures and Christian symbolism. Despite this influence, I didn't see any mention of Christian Cabbala. In conclusion, brujeria to me seems to be the Spanish counterpart to the English neo-paganism movement with mythical figures that tie into Pre-Mexican cultures. Its a mixture of diverse magical practices from African voodoo to Aztec/Mexica mythology and even Catholicism. Did I miss anything?

Is it possible that an English speaker could learn to read Mandarin this way?Suppose instead of reading 你好 as nihao, you could just read it as "hello"; knowing that 你好 = hello.Are there any bits of Mandarin grammar that prevent learning to read this way? PS. If it helps, think of the hypothetical person as deaf-mute and therefore wouldn't really benefit from knowing how the language is spoken, but is interested in learning to read it.

2zkqzf	-30287	1426766064	2007scape	Can't believe i fell for it...	Hey guys my name is Proxeum, this is my first month back playing runescape since i quit around 10 years ago! I started playing in runescape classic, so as you are probably aware i have quite the knowledge of the game and the scammers that come with it.So i had just bought myself a robin hood hat, someone approached me, traded and showed me 70m in cash, saying i could win it if i went with them, i was obviously thinking that this is a scam but went along with it anyways to waste said persons time, we arrive in camelot and she asks me to show her my best items and my gold, i show her fury amulet, robin hood hat, dark bow and 1m in cash, she tells me to follow her, i realise that its the candle scam, so i was thinking of just wasting her time as i said before, until half way there, she's asking me a question, and someones running opposite way, stops runs back and asks me to add them ASAP, so i do, he explains she is trying to scam me, which i already know, he seems like a nice person for telling me anyways, he tells me that i can get my items back if i drop them at the stairs and links me a video explaining how to counter it, turns out he was lying and i had just lost my stuff and fell for it.I'll take this as a lesson, he was obviously working with her, sometimes you can't trust anyone.

She covers for me for a week on one of my projects and assigns a task to herself which she royally effs up by incorrectly merging spreadsheets.. 3 weeks later she still hasn't fixed her mess, so I step in to help as it's my name on the project. I fix it in an hour. She sends me a NASTY email saying how she didn't appreciate my going around her and we will be talking about it and how the behavior is NOT acceptable.  Being a PM we are trained on conflict resolution so I reply saying sorry for frustrating her and we win as a team etc. Meanwhile I stress all weekend on my getaway about the 'conversation' she alluded to that's to happen on Monday. On a whim I appeal to a higher power and email my boss the entire thread with her nasty response and ask if we can address this. I don't hear back but Sunday night I get an email from her apologizing and saying she has bigger fish to fry so good luck on my project. The next morning she is nice and acts like nothing happened. I stressed all weekend for nothing. Today I was told she is going to report to me.... :)

18x7la	-30318	1361407761	leagueoflegends	Is there a site that discusses counterpicking and WHY certain champs are good counterpicks?	Not fishing for upvotes.I see all of these sites for counterpicking but they never really tell you why a champ is a good counterpick for another one so they feel sorta useless because you don't know what kind of playstyle you should be acting out.For example Vlad you usually have to play passive because he sucks until level 9 (no pun intended). However if I play him as a counterpick to Singed I can play more liberally in top lane because I can just punish him when he tries to get close and just chunk him. If I didn't know how this matchup worked however I would play it out wrong and potentially lose the lane. The same goes for Kayle vs Darius, except for a different reason. If I was new to Kayle I wouldn't realize how she plays top by kiting and swinging away at people. Darius is weak to kiting but if I never played Kayle I wouldn't know how to properly trade and would fail at my "counterpick". Her ult also counters him but that's something you need to be aware of when you consider the matchup.

194fqn	-30318	1361688370	leagueoflegends	Vlad's pool not working properly?	Okay, so I know for a fact that there's two things Vlad's pool cannot protect him from: on-going tethers (like Fiddles' drain) and on-going DoTs (like ignite or Swain's E). So here's the problem I ran into in my last game. Maokai comes in to chase me when I'm pushing the second top tower. I'm not worried because I'm Vlad. I can bait his Twisted Advance then pool while he's casting. So he casts his snare and I cast pool and **I end up snared**. Is this a bug or is this how Vlad's pool is intended to work?

1bljlt	-30318	1365008898	Awesomenauts	What does the community see as overpowered or broken in this game?	I'm sorta new so my perception on this might be skewed. I'm gonna give the reasons why I think nauts are good (maybe too good) though, just so we have a starting point for discussion. I won't go that much in-depth on nauts I don't play since that's not really being fair to them.**Froggy G**: Play him a little bit. A good Froggy can be annoying, a bad one can be an easy feast. Overall I feel he's balanced but then again I haven't used all of the upgrades for him yet, especially his tornado (and there's some interesting ones in there).**Lonestar**: If I want to push and make life difficult for the enemy, then I pick Lonestar.* Dynamite deals good consistent damage to turrets (especially if you buy the triple dynamite upgrade), act as a good burst or escape tool (blind) and just makes you generally annoying.* Bull is great cc since if done right will push the enemy back into your team or tower and lead to their death. It also helps immensely with pushing or solo tower tanking in a way nobody else can compare with.**Leon**: Play him occasionally. I can see why his tongue is an important ability to have in this game, it helps deal with some otherwise difficult stuff in an easier manner. Can't decide how to feel about him since he feels necessary but... I don't like getting pulled and backstabbed either lol.**Clunk**: Has amazing health and burst potential and I try to exploit that as early as possible. However, at least since I've started playing he feels weak especially because of Genji's prevalence. I don't play missile Clunk so I can't comment on that.* Bite -&gt; Explosion combined with Clunk's tankiness make him a real threat on the battlefield, especially if he has the snare/slow upgrades and is with someone else who can help lock down the enemy team* Genji is essentially a hardcounter to an explosion Clunk as he cannot detonate if cocooned**Voltar**: Don't really play him. His healing has made for some scary pushes but I feel like Genji shuts down his primary benefactors too hard for him to be considered strong right now.**Gnaw**: Pretty decent at playing defense, his DoT can be hard to deal with without a reasonable health pool or health regen/lifesteal. Seedlings can be annoying depending on where he places them.* Good defender since seedlings can help fortify turrets* Good duelist since his spit DoT can melt people* Good for setting traps with dropping spit and seedlings**Coco**: Arguable who's better for poking between her and Rae. Ball Lightning doesn't force you to stay in place and can go through walls, and is accompanied by some decent knockback.* Her poke can become ridiculous, especially since it can be hard to dodge and easily catch you off guard with the enhanced travel speed.* Her slow/DoT allows her to dodge chasers and set up enemies to get mauled by the rest of her team.**Skølldir**: I don't play him but man, he's dumb to face. Has some crazy lockdown (3 forms of cc) and DoT combined with the fact that he's tanky. Not fun.**Yuri**: Yuri feels like a big offender of balance at the moment (at least at higher unlock levels). Mines can be a problem but the biggest problem with him is his slow field. Honestly the size upgrade makes it HUGE and impossible to escape from him. Add to that the upgrades that make his slow even worse to deal with (and a slow on his laser) and his teammates, you're basically screwed if you get caught by him.* Mines are good for helping waveclear/area denial/setting up traps but **generally** require strategy in placement.* As mentioned his slow field is ridiculous. Some teams will just find it impossible to deal with.**Raelynn**: I like playing her, lots of people that end up in my games like playing her. There's a reason, it's really easy to get fed with her and even if your snipes don't always work out she has a strong kit to fall back on, since her autos and slow field can deal ridiculous damage.* +50 Solar on kill makes it really easy to snowball* High damage long range nuke murders squishies, punishes tanks and (sorta) reveals stealth* Slow punishes enemy nauts who get caught in it heavily, especially a deployed Derpl because by the time he exits turret mode he's basically dead* Good duelist with autoattacks, especially with the upgrade on her slow that jacks up her autoattack damage after cast**Derpl**: I don't really play cat Derpl and haven't seen it yet so I don't know how good it is. However I know how good turret Derpl can be in the hands of a good player.* Snare -&gt; Turret -&gt; Nuke combo can be very hard to deal with and will straight-up kill squishier nauts.* Good Derpls will deploy on fall-through floors, as they can still fall through when deployed allowing them an easier escape.* Very good pusher, if allowed to he will just destroy turrets in no time flat.**Vinnie and Spike**: He annoys me, I know that. He has good burst, mobility and on top of that his smokescreen is a really easy escape move. I can't play him worth a shit though.**Genji**: Now I know how people feel about him, and honestly I can see where they are coming from. Genji feels like he was intended to be a jack of all trades, master of none however he does his jobs just as well if not better than more specialized characters and that should change. It's bad to the point where you feel like you've lost if the enemy team has a Genji who isn't braindead and you don't.* Autoattack modifier that is really good at waveclear and zoning* Excellent cc that neutralizes channels and Clunk's explosion; also packs more utility on top of that with team healing and %hp damage upgrades* Monarch Blessing can help lots of incoming damage, heal teammates and speed them up, among other thingsThese are just my thoughts though, curious what people think about everyone since I am new to this and unfamiliar with whatever the meta is and the overall opinion on most 'Nauts.

1crxfv	-30318	1366507677	Games	So what is your opinion on the trend of publishers selling a "Season Pass" for DLC for their AAA titles?	Honestly, when I purchased a season pass for Borderlands 2, I thought I was getting a good deal because I enjoyed the game. However, since then I joined reddit and got game news that I wouldn't have gotten otherwise since I don't really follow that outside of this site. I saw what happened with Aliens: Colonial Marines (which was also worked on by Gearbox, somewhat ironically), and what struck me most with the backlash towards the quality of that particular game was TotalBiscuit's video on how pre-orders and the bonuses that come with them are just a hook to get people to buy into the game before they know what they are really getting.And that all resonates with me especially regarding this example game; that is, Borderlands 2. It is, no doubt, a good game. At least, in my opinion. However it had the same level of frustration with preorders - if you didn't preorder, well then you didn't get a $10 DLC character and a worthless arena area where you fight off slag-experimented wildlife.Okay, whatever. The way the season pass was billed to me made it sound like it'd give you all of the important content. Was I disappointed that Gaige was not included? A little. But honestly it was a preorder bonus so whatever, I didn't expect to get her in the season pass. However, hearing news about a Psycho character being released as **$10 DLC NOT INCLUDED IN THE SEASON PASS**, it made me evaluate the worth of the season pass in the first place. Is an entirely new class not important downloadable content, especially since Gearbox forces class drops for those two characters regardless of whether you own the DLC or not? Also, seeing as I haven't played any of the DLC besides Gaige yet (haven't had the chance to play BL2 much since school), it is entirely possible that they churn out DLCs that are really not worth your time or money (Mad Moxxi's Underdrome, anyone?)... but guess what, you already prepaid for those DLCs already so you paid for them whether they were great or total shit. It's the preorder conundrum all over again, isn't it? Where you get promised a prettier price in exchange for not knowing what you're going to get, and more importantly, what you're NOT going to get.tl;dr: Is the season pass idea the same kind of evil as preorders are? Is it on a greater level? Or is it actually a good deal in the era where DLC is expected as opposed to a barely practiced thing.

He can pack some decent damage, and is fairly scary if you get a gank off well (and his kit offers the utility you would want too). I wanna know what you guys think though.

1hlmcv	-30318	1372894059	Gaming4Gamers	As an avid L4D2 player, here's why I believe that the series deserves a new installment sooner rather than later (because it always gets dismissed when brought up).	Matchmaking, my god this has always been bad. Have players come in and stack teams with their friends so that you can't play Versus alone... I hope Valve puts in matchmaking in the next game because I can't play Versus without 7 other friends.Holdout finales are all broken. When I last played this game a while ago I remembered Death Toll's rescue vehicle would randomly come early but that was about it. Now this happens in most holdout finales. Almost unquestionably in versus too which is annoying.I don't know if this happens in Blood Harvest but it's happened to us in Dark Carnival, No Mercy, Dead Air and Death Toll. Hasn't happened to us on Hard Rain but idk if that's a fluke or not (us playing the map was).Awful tank spawns on some maps. Example is the beginning of Dead Air, where survivors can just camp at the start.Game is too easy for survivors. Grenade Launchers, ample tier 2 weapons... and shit like guaranteed free health kits in the gunshop in Dead Center and before the crescendo on The Parish 2. Part of this is game problems, part of this is map problems. I feel like maps need to be harder because Versus has turned into "who can deal more damage to survivors" as opposed to "who can make it farther".Charger physics just suck. I hate how I charge through people when I should be carrying victims off a charge. I hate how easy it is to get caught on doorframes when you are charging straight. I've had a situation where I hit all 4 survivors on the roller coaster in dark carnival and only killed one because I basically stopped after hitting the 4th at the top of the coaster. So I was mad that I didn't get kills (they kinda got lightly tossed against the railing) or at least fall damage on my carried victim because I stopped at the top of the coaster.I really hate how you can exploit to get past points of no return. Had an enemy team blatantly ignore their last member who got pounced past the barrier in Dead Center's mall. They then find a defib and do the chair shove exploit to get over the barrier and revive them... And teammates wasted their good smoker and charger spawns trying to stop them.
1hro3w	-30318	1373145826	Gaming4Gamers	So, let's discuss the story of The Last of Us [obvious spoilers]	I just finished Winter. It's amazing how easy Naughty Dog made it to despise David. Like, from the start I hated him just because of how he acted towards Ellie and the pedophile thing was sorta subtle but not too subtle in the jail scene. And holy crap, the brutal self-defense murder at the end of that whole David encounter thing.I was not expecting Fall to end the way it did, holy shit. And the ending of Summer made me cry... Sam and Henry :(Honestly I feel like this was one of the best stories I've ever played through. Ever.There's lots of subtleties, probably stuff I've even missed so far so I'm like, hey how do people do this for books? And the answer is book club. So let's do The Last of Us at book club. Right now. Anything goes. Just talk.I have yet to play Spring yet but still feel free to post anything regarding that. I've sadly already been somewhat spoiled about the ending sequences.

So I figured it was probably the Steam overlay that was the problem and disabling it has gotten me consistently better games and I've actually been able to do stuff in-game now. It's great. Try it if you have performance problems.

So I think this should be a thread where we share guides and theorycraft and stuff so there aren't a dearth of relevant guides when the patch goes live.

"Quick" KOs when someone hits the top blast zone are cool and all but I only think they're necessary when time has almost run out/it's their last stock or something. When you're playing certain characters it puts you at a disadvantage if they don't Star K.O.Like Jigglypuff.

I've been messing around with Peach and R.O.B. lately (this mostly applies to Smash 4 but it'd be interesting to know how it works in other iterations if there's any difference) and I thought to myself, will make game improve if I start z-dropping with them?But what's the difference between that and throwing down?
2znzon	-30318	1426824668	smashbros	Playing against Villager: How much do you feel that having a reflector helps you?	I've seen a lot of people on this sub going "X definitely beats Villager because they have a reflector", and honestly, in my opinion this is completely not true (except in a few cases but they are hardly seen).First, you have to use the reflector at the right time. Some people pick reflector characters against me and never use them or use them in a way that makes it super easy to punish. Did you know that Mii Gunner's grenade can be absorbed with their energy shield? Well my friend did it to me once when I pocketed it but every time after he would immediately energy shield when I pocketed and I grabbed him every time for free damage. This one seems a bit self-explanatory but you'd be surprised.Secondly, even if you do get a reflect off, is it worth it? Sometimes I'll throw a Lloid Rocket at someone if I know they like to shield a lot so I can get a free grab and maybe rocket damage off top of that as well. I feel like the same goes for reflectors; if I throw something at you when you have one it's either because I think you're not in a position to react or I'm baiting you. If a Villager tries to chop their tree on you just back off; they want you to reflect so they can pocket it and drop it on you instantly instead of having to go through the telegraphed chopping and felling of the tree. If you want to reflect my Rocket then I'm probably going to use it as a window to Pocket it to mix things up later or I'm going to use it as a window to Nair or turnip you.In a perfect game a reflector character can reflect everything back at Villager but the Villager player can also react accordingly in MOST cases. I feel like default Palutena (yes she is actually decent at something!) is good at beating Villager because her Reflector and Autoreticle are really good at just walling Villager. Zelda is also fairly decent at this because her reflector has obnoxious effects if you try to get close and Din's Fire can't be pocketed. But in most cases it makes the matchup more interesting, but does not favor one player over the other because of the reflector because it means Villager just gets better versions of their own projectiles back.TL;DR **Shining** a light on how reflectors don't equal a cakewalk against Villager.
33mp6a	-30318	1429818291	MortalKombat	Cassie Cage Hidden Brutality	So I was playing Kustom Kombat to grind factions a little and to get Revenant Jax fast. I was playing as Cassie in Spec Ops variation so I could get the kards for that one faster as well since I never play that variation.I was playing with 2 Danger! mods on (1 from both player because I didn't know if having no mod on the other player forces random ones or not). I killed my opponent with American Way both rounds and when I did it for the second round his head turned around and it counted as a brutality!I know Spec Ops has a brutality but that one says to do 5 American ways and finish them with an enhanced target paint.I can't get this to come out consistently though, so I'm really confused as to what actually triggers this.[Picture Proof.](http://i.imgur.com/rDVhwLJ.jpg)

I've mostly just heard people discussing them on gaming channels because that's what I go to youtube for. I know a little bit about them but I want to understand more of what they do to understand youtube problems. They seem like something that work behind the scenes.I've heard people talking about Machinima (in relation to Darksydephil, stuff like "Machinima is what's keeping you alive, idk why they still pay your dumb ass") and Polaris mostly. Do they give youtubers protections from video takedowns? How is contact between members regulated? I heard that Game Grumps weren't allowed to talk bad about JonTron, but Dunkey dumps on Keyori like every other video and they're all under the same network I thought?As much info as possible would be appreciated, thanks.

Anyway, I've decided to switch to an IUD to save on long term costs, but I need help in deciding.I've only had one birth control and that was loestrin fe pill, which I love. It seems to improve my mood and makes my period disappear. This is the main reason i was considering Mirena, because hormones have been good to me so far, though I know they aren't for everyone.However, the copper IUD lasts for TWELVE YEARS. That blows my mind. The main reason I keep my plan is for gyno visits and copays on both control. So that would be awesome.Any experiences dealing with either, or both, as well as any ideas on how to proceed would be appreciated. I'm leaving toward Mirena at the moment, because I love how my pill helps me.Also, what should I tell my bf to expect during sex...? I have no idea what to tell him it should feel like.

2vt1i1	-30326	1423862017	legaladvice	[Texas] Friend needs help getting out of a bad marriage.	I'm writing on behalf of my friend (who gave me permission to write this). She is in a bad living situation with her husband. This is in Texas.Background is she has been married 8 years, and has two young children with him. Over the past few years he has badgered her into having open relationships (he already had someone picked out), cheating on her, and lying about where he was/ who he was with, being verbally abusive, etc.The situation as of now is he does not want a divorce, but he wants her to be ok with him sleeping around/dating. She no longer cares that he does this (to her, the relationship is over) but he is holding her hostage in a marriage. She does not make enough money on her own to support the kids, her vehicle, living expenses and whatnot, so she is still living in the same house with him. He has threatened that if she moves away to a different county, he will divorce her, essentially FORCING her and the kids to move back in this county, all the while she would not be able to make enough to support the kids/ herself. He has also threatened that if she divorces him, he will drag it out as long as possible. I'm sure she could get the divorce but in the meantime, figuring out the children could be difficult, especially since he makes more money. She would be hard pressed to find a lawyer/ money for living if he kicked her out...which he has also threatened. She is worried if she goes through with the divorce, he will kick her out and the courts will NOT give her the kids because she is homeless, or very poor.I am worried for her. She is sticking to her guns and is a strong woman, but this guy goes out of his way to make sure that she doesn't have much money, and can rarely get out of the house, thanks to her watching the children most of the time while he is out. On top of that he yells at her and calls her names. (Kids hear this). But this guy seems to hold all of the cards. He is control of the majority of the money, the house is in his name, and he knows she won't fight him if it means she is separated from the kids.Any possible information would be helpful. She is trying to get a pro-bono lawyer, but it's taking a long time and she still may not go through with it. Any resources, or advice, is appreciated.

3arljo	-30326	1435014381	legaladvice	Employer wanting to dock salaried employees for hour/half hours, but doesn't want to pay over time. [TX]	(Texas) My co-worker and I are salaried employees. I was hired as salary, and she was switched to salary from hourly several years ago. Neither of us are contract. One of the nice benefits at this job, is if we need to take off a few minutes for a Doctor visit or parent teacher conference, we could. Of course, we always asked for permission, with plenty of notice beforehand, with none of these being more than an hour or so at most. Again, always with Boss permission.We are now being told we are going to be docked those hours. We were surprised. We weren't taking days or half days. She was talking about docking us 30 minutes increments. When questioned about overtime, she told us that since we were salary, we would NOT be getting any over time. I know that there are exempt salary positions, but I don't think our jobs remotely qualify. (graphic artist and office person) We're also at a small company, so we end us doing a  lot of things outside of those job fields. Is it legal for them to dock us pay like this? And then not pay us overtime?Secondly, If they decide to switch us to hourly for this reason, then is that legal/ should I ask about changes in job duties? It seems like if they're going to switch us to salary they'd need a reason/ we'd have different duties.
3ie9el	-30326	1440543902	legaladvice	(TX) Husband refusing to divorce spouse, controls finances, what are her options?	I'm asking for a friend, this is in Texas, and I will give the details as they have been explained to me. I'm going to try to go off of facts that can either be proven, or by what she has put together. She's trying to find options to get away from him while keeping at least part custody of the kids, since she does not make much money. I am going to bold his relevant actions, because I think she needs immediate help for those.They have been married for a number of years and have two young children together. There has been cheating going on, which she has caught him at/ has proof of...repeatedly. Apparently, her situation began when, after fighting for awhile, **he emptied (or closed?) their joint account**, which she did deposit into. She is currently living in a house that is in both of their names, however, at least according to her, only HIS name is on the loan. In lieu of paying child support, he has been paying the loan and some of her bills, while he has moved in with his current girlfriend. She recently filed for child support , causing him to: **threaten to quit his job so he doesn't have to pay child support, stop paying on the loan so she will have to move out, ask her to take her name off of the house, and threaten to stop paying bills on the house.** The bills were in his name, however, he convinced her to put one of the bills in her name.She doesn't have a child support hearing (meeting?) for several months. She does not make enough to pay for the house or it's expenses on her own, much less a lawyer. To top it off, most of the time, the children are with her, or a caretaker (not the husband). She has tried to get pro-bono lawyers in the area, but has been waiting for almost a year now.Other possibly relevant info:*  She has numerous texts of him berating her and calling her terrible names.(slut, whore, bitch etc..)* She has had to call the cops on him before for intentionally ramming her car, however they did nothing.* She believes he is leaving an excessive amounts off his taxes by getting his customers to pay in cash/ getting a friend to help fudge his taxes for them.* She changed at least one of the locks at the house she lives in (in both their names) and he is demanding a key.* He refuses her access to a vehicle in both their names.* She claims he has hit her, and while she does not have proof/did not file a report, she is actively scared of him harming her/ any man she is with.Basically, she has very little income, no where to go, and can not afford help. She is worried that any move she makes will set him out to take her kids/her home, which he has already promised to do.  While she DOES have family several hours away that would take her, the husband has threatened to divorce her and try and get it so that she could only live so far away from him.

Naiobi is here too, looking better than ever. [picture](http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y167/aznballa920/IMG_0394.jpg)So heres the story...* About a year and a half ago, I knocked "The Refrigerator" against my fireplace and the tube shattered into three pieces. i was heartbroken but kept her safe * On 4/21/12, a friend of mine kicked my 3 month old Naiobi into my coffee table, causing the mouth piece to break off from the tube(see picture)* I knew I had to get Naiobi fixed and found the guys at glassrepair805.com who specialize in boro glass. Since I was sending one in, I thought "why not fix the Fridge too?" * three weeks later, i tracked the package and stayed up all night waiting for the fedex guy to show up (sort of writing papers too). When I finally heard the fedex truck outside, I rushed to the door only to see him drive away a few seconds later. Heartbroken, I sit back down and wait for another 30 minutes before he comes back with my glorious package. tldr: Both of these were broken and now they aren't!This is my first post to r/trees...I couldn't be more thankful to the guys at 805 for fixing my buddies up and allowing me to share them with r/trees :)

Hopefully somebody here knows better than I do.---Is there anything in the editor that would create better players when you tick the box for "Add Players to Playable Teams"? I've downloaded a database that comes with new teams and competitions but doesn't have players on those teams, so I tick the box to make sure those teams have enough players, but the game generates players that are much worse than the reputation and financial standing of the teams. Sure, each team is roughly on equal footing because they get roughly equally bad players, but I'd love it if these teams could be filled with the same quality players as their reputation.I found the "Youth Rating" number and can raise that, but that only means that teams will have really high potential prospects, but their current players aren't very good.

Saw this question on twitter via [@kingofmyworld19](http://www.twitter.com/kingofmyworld19). You can either choose to start your franchise with Anthony Davis or any two players from the same team in the league, how many teams are there that you would pick the two players over AD?My answer would be OKC and GSW for sure, I'd rather have any two of the Russ/KD/Ibaka trio than AD and I'd rather have Steph and either Klay or Draymond than AD. After that, it gets interesting for me. Would you rather have Hayward and Gobert from Utah? How about Jabari Parker and Giannis Antetokounmpo from Milwaukee? Some people were saying Cleveland, even though LeBron is older maybe you'd go with LeBron's twilight years and Kyrie's prime.

Ted Thompson is basically the Packers' version of Harry Potter. You talk about him all the time and all you do is mention his name. He nearly single-handedly brought the franchise back to the top of the football world. I'm not joking either. Over the ten years that Thompson has been the GM, the level of talent on the Packers has risen so high that even the sometimes-awful in-game coaching of Mike McCarthy couldn't keep them away from the Lombardi Trophy. To explain Thompson's fantastic tenure as GM, let's simply look at his six drafts leading up to the 2011 Super Bowl run:**2005 Draft: Aka the Aaron Rodgers draft**(# of picks: 11, # currently with team: 1)**Pick**|**Player**-|-1st Round|Aaron Rodgers (QB)2nd Round|Nick Collins (DB)2nd Round|Terrence Murphy (WR)4th Round|Marviel Underwood (DB)4th Round|Brady Poppinga (LB)5th Round|Junius Coston (G)5th Round|Michael Hawkins (DB)6th Round|Mike Montgomery (DT)6th Round|Craig Bragg (WR)7th Round|Kurt Campbell (DB)7th Round|Will Whitticker (G)**Summary**: Aaron Rodgers is the only player in this draft still with the team, but he’s pretty good so that worked out nicely. Collins returned an interception for a touchdown in the Super Bowl, but hurt his neck the next year and was forced to retire. Brady Poppinga was with the team until 2012 and appeared in 100 games. The rest of these guys didn’t make a big impact on the team. Nobody except for Rodgers is still in the league.**2006 Draft: Aka the AJ Hawk draft**(# of picks: 11, # currently with team: 0)**Pick**|**Player**-|-1st Round|AJ Hawk (LB)2nd Round|Daryn Colledge (OT)2nd Round|Greg Jennings (WR)3rd Round|Abdul Hodge (LB)3rd Round|Jason Spitz (G)4th Round|Cory Rodgers (WR)4th Round|Will Blackmon (DB)5th Round|Ingle Martin (QB)5th Round|Tony Moll (OT)6th Round|Johnny Jolly (DT)7th Round|Dave Tollefson (DE)**Summary**: None of these players are still with the team, but Hawk, Colledge, and Jennings all contributed to the Super Bowl-winning team in 2011. Hawk and Colledge appeared in 142 and 141 games respectively, and Jennings made 2 Pro Bowls Blackmon is still in the league, having moved to the Giants and then the Jaguars in recent years. Spitz made 75 appearances along the offensive line. Johnny Jolly has been out of the league since 2013 and has had his fair share of legal trouble but remains close to the Packers’ players.**2007 Draft: Aka maybe the worst draft of the ten**(# of picks: 11, # currently with team: 1)**Pick**|**Player**-|-1st Round|Justin Harrell (DT)2nd Round|Brandon Jackson (RB)3rd Round|James Jones (WR)3rd Round|Aaron Rouse (DB)4th Round|Allen Barbre (OT)5th Round|Dave Clowney (WR)6th Round|Korey Hall (LB)6th Round|Desmond Bishop (LB)6th Round|Mason Crosby (K)7th Round|DeShawn Wynn (RB)7th Round|Clark Harris (TE)**Summary**: Not a great draft, especially at the top. Harrell played 14 games for the Pack over four years before getting bounced out of the league. James Jones peaked as the third WR but seemed to drop a lot of big passes, including a really bad one in the Super Bowl that probably would have been a touchdown.. Jones left for the Raiders after the 2013 season. Desmond Bishop was a terrific linebacker for the Packers for quite a few years, but Thompson decided not to re-sign him when he was out of contract in 2013, which ended up being a great decision; he’s played in just six games the last three years. Jones, Barbre, Bishop, Crosby, and Harris are still in the league with only Crosby still with the Pack. Nobody from this draft made a Pro Bowl with the Packers.**2008 Draft: Aka the Are-We-Sure-Aaron-Rodgers-Is-Good? draft**(# of picks: 9, # currently with team: 3)**Pick**|**Player**-|-2nd Round|Jordy Nelson (WR)2nd Round|Brian Brohm (QB)2nd Round|Patrick Lee (DB)3rd Round|Jermichael Finley (TE)4th Round|Jeremy Thompson (DE)4th Round|Josh Sitton (OL)5th Round|Breno Giacomini (OL)7th Round|Matt Flynn (QB)7th Round|Brett Swain (WR)**Summary**: This was Thompson’s first draft since Favre “retired”, but before Rodgers had had a chance to prove himself. Brohm would make three appearances for the Packers and has been out of the league since 2010, and Flynn was a great backup for a handful of years before getting a big contract in Seattle and later Oakland before coming back to the Pack. Nelson and Sitton have been mainstays in the Packers’ lineup, making 105 appearances each. Nelson has 1 Pro Bowl to his name; Sitton has 2. Jermichael Finley played a big role on the team through the 2013 season, but injuries have forced him to leave football.**2009 Draft: Aka The-Only-Time-Thompson-Had-Two-First-Round-Picks draft**(# of picks: 8, # currently with team: 3)**Pick**|**Player**-|-1st Round|BJ Raji (DT)1st Round|Clay Matthews (LB)4th Round|TJ Lang (OL)5th Round|Quinn Johnson (RB)5th Round|Jamon Meredith (OT)6th Round|Jarius Wynn (DE)6th Round|Brandon Underwood7th Round|Brad Jones**Summary**: Thompson traded up on draft day to grab the 5-time Pro-Bowler Matthews, trading three second- and third-round picks for the first-rounder and the fifth-rounder that became Jamon Meredith from the Patriots. Matthews made the biggest play of the Super Bowl win, forcing a fumble from Rashard Mendenhall as the Steelers were driving for the lead in the fourth quarter. Lang has been on the Packers’ OL since the beginning, playing in 91 of a possible 96 regular-season games in the last six years. Raji broke out during the 2011 run-in to the Super Bowl, including a pick six in the NFC Championship Game in Chicago, but has been plagued by injuries and inconsistent play since then.**2010 Draft: Aka the Almost-Everyone-Is-Still-Around draft**(# of picks: 7, # currently with team: 5)**Pick**|**Player**-|-1st Round|Bryan Bulaga (OL)2nd Round|Mike Neal (DE)3rd Round|Morgan Burnett (DB)5th Round|Andrew Quarless (TE)5th Round|Marshall Newhouse (OL)6th Round|James Starks (RB)7th Round|CJ Wilson (DE)**Summary**: Wilson and Newhouse are no longer with the team, but each of the other five has played each of his five years in Green Bay. There are no Pro-Bowlers among this lot, but they have all made contributions to the team. Bulaga missed the entire 2013 season but played 15 games last season and looks to be a big part of the future of the Packers’ offensive line. Neal transformed himself from a hand-down defensive end to a suitable outside linebacker last season, allowing Clay Matthews to move inside. Burnett has missed just four games in the last four years and has proven to be a worthwhile safety. Quarless has played in all 32 games the last two years and has been a consistent target for Aaron Rodgers. Starks is best known for his playoff run in 2011 after playing in just three regular season games that year, during which he averaged almost 80 yards per game. Since then, he’s been in and around the team and is a reliable backup running back. **Overall Summary**: Ted Thompson drafted 14 of the 22 Super Bowl XLV starters for the Packers and remains one of the best GMs in the league and drafting and developing young talent.

I do a bit of writing about basketball, and being able to record my screen while I watch plays on NBA.com would go a long way in being able to justify a quite expensive purchase of a new computer.Right now, I use QuickTime Player to record my screen on my mid-2010 MacBook Pro, but once I press play on the video, it's very choppy and the recording also comes out choppy, not at all good enough to include in my writing. If I had a better computer, would this be possible?The CPU I'm looking at is [this Intel i7](https://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80646i74790k), and the graphics card I'm looking at is [this GTX 970](https://pcpartpicker.com/part/msi-video-card-gtx970gaming4g). I don't know much about computers at all, so I'm not sure if other components play a part in what I'm trying to do. [Here's the full parts list if you want to look at other components.](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/jgsiegel/saved/#view=bZGRsY)Please let me know if what I'm planning on buying is sufficient to record my screen with no lag or choppiness.

In the next few weeks I'm going to have a nice new gaming computer that will be able to play the game, so I figured I'd jump on the sale.I didn't download or install any of the DLC or the game itself on my Mac, but when I go to the game in my Steam Library the DLC all looks [like this.](http://i.imgur.com/vOhyc8L.png)I'm worried that when I get my new computer and open up Steam through Windows, Steam will think I have the DLC for Mac and it won't download or install. Has anyone else had this problem? What happened when you installed it on a Windows if you bought it on Mac?

Do I need the motherboard to have a wireless adapter if I'm going to be connecting to my house's WiFi and not via an ethernet cable? I watched a YouTube review for my case and it seems like it will house everything well. There are places for extra fans should that be a need down the road, but it doesn't seem like I'm going to need extra fans right off the bat. I have a 3TB external hard drive, so there's no need for anything more than the 250GB SSD I have on my list now.

The fans that came with the H100i don't mount anywhere on their own, they only connect to the radiator that came with it, so I can't just use the fans and not the rest of the system. My question is: Can I still use my computer to play games like Civ, Cities: Skylines, the new Batman game, Trials Fusion, and LA Noire?The case itself comes with two 120mm intake fans at the front, a 200mm intake fan on the side, and a 120mm exhaust fan at the back. There are spaces for two more fans but I don't have any fans to fill those holes yet. The graphics card has two fans of its own, the Intel CPU came with the stock fan that sits right on top of it, and the Power Supply has its own fan inside of it.Should I continue to put together my build and try to play for a little while using this until I can get two more fans or until I can get a cooling system that will fit, or will I overheat the shit out of everything if I try to make it work?EDIT:Adding in some pictures so that someone might be able to help with actually getting the cooling to work.From the top view, where the case is being laid on its side. [If you can see it, the fan sticks out just far enough to catch the top of the gold thing on the right and the blue RAM on the left.](http://i.imgur.com/oEWGFWs.jpg)From the side view, [you can see that I don't have a whole lot further to go to get it to work.](http://i.imgur.com/XUKGCaT.jpg)For reference, I'm trying to install the radiator and fans at the top of the case, where there are two empty fan slots for the double-wide radiator. I don't think there's another place in the case that the radiator could go.

Nothing is more infuriating to me than in a late-game situation when I'm fighting a war on two fronts and then I defeat all the units in front of me on one front, so I swing a couple of units across to the other, only to see the next turn that a few ships bringing more infantry or whatever just happen to pop up right on my coast. I don't mind if a submarine or nuclear submarine can get through the satellites undetected, but it really shouldn't be possible that a Destroyer with Infantry on top is able to waltz up to my shores without me knowing until they're right on top of me.

It looks like the shank had previously been repaired and is probably a basket pipe for that reason. I have stopped smoking it and the fit has loosened up. My question is, does it need to be professionally repaired or will smoking it cause the shank to expand and fix the loose fit? Thanks for your time fellas.

3a8rb2	-30350	1434596844	tifu	TIFU by being a creep (reposted with title)	Well I don't really know where to begin so I guess I'll start at Dutch Bros. Some of you may know that Dutch Bros is a national coffee house, well more like a stand. Think like a One Hour photo converted into to make espressos and dankilicous breves and other caffienated treats. Now this particular coffee chain has a tendency to hire college kids mostly hot college girls. I visit this particular location almost everyday, not for the eye candy but for the much needed caffination.I'm there a lot. To the point where I start to know the workers on a first name basis, the staff know my order and have it ready with a friendly "see you cashnobucks!" Cheers type shit. Really special. One day I visit and I notice an absolute goddess, she was cute, funny, sarcastic, nerdy, angelic blue eyes, and a incredible body. Just amazing. First time I meet her I am over whelmed with warming sensations had I forgotten about, pure enamoration, unfamilair tickely butterflies swarmed the hollow pit formally requitted for my heart. All I could stammer was my order and I left as quickly as my feet would allow. After a few more palpation like encounters I learned her name, and a few more things about her. Keep in mind I'm too chicken shit to ask her out so I just keep going to her work and ordering coffee just to see her. I must have spent about $60-80 at 5 bux a cup just to try and ask her out. Each time didn't feel right, or one of her coworkers would be there in the moment. All in all I never asked her out. Fuck up number one all while keeping up my routine of spending money for 45 secs of interaction. I notice one day she isn't there, no biggie I'll see her tomorrow I tell myself. Again next day, not there. This goes on for a week or two. This is where fuck up number two hits. Let me preface this by saying I have never and will never do this again. I creepily used her first name and work location to find her on Facebook, yea it gets worse. I then decide to stalk her profile further, yea it gets worse, I think she's cool so I shoot her a friend request. I get no response. Nothing. Not even a who are you. Yea it gets worse. I convice myself she knows me from the 1000's of other faces she see's daily, and she probably wants to hear from me but she is shy so I should send the first message. Yea it gets worse. I send an innocent little Hey greeting. Again completely ignored. Not blaming her but just to emphasize, no signs of invitation what so ever. A few hours goes by and I still haven't gotten a new friend or a response.Then my confidence cracks like a frabrege egg, all the hindsight poured in like a fucking tsunami of negative introspection, all my creepy stalkering displayed before me. Each interaction with her replayed like a horror movie, similar to the classic grey scale re-enactments you would see on those awful murder investigation shows, complete with over dramatization. I anxiously decided I better just come clean and confess my intentions, I figured I walked up to the cliff so fuck it. I then sent another message explaining how I feel, and then another apologizing for my creepy stalking. Still no response and it's been 8 hours. I probably don't deserve any thing close to her or anyone else for that matter. So yea that's my fuckup. I'm not old, I'm 27. I'm not ugly. I'm not obese or have any health issues. I even have the blonde hair blue eyes combo. I dress well and have good hygeine. Just to get those out of the way. I'm not a virgin either -_-Tl;Dr Went to great coffee spot. Tried to ask out server but didn't then stalked her Facebook. Obviously got ignored coz I'm a creepy stalker man. I am forever alone. How do people do this ?

2z87eb	-30353	1426510736	printers	Printer ink not drying properly. Help please!	So I have been attempting to print some pictures for a scrapbooking project for my wife. My problem is the ink just does not want to dry. My first thought was that the photo paper I was using just isn't compatible with my printer/ink so I picked up a different brand of photo paper. Still no dice. so I decided to begin testing.    When I print on regular plain white paper with normal settings everything is fine. The ink dries and the print looks normal. however I don't want to use normal white paper for the pictures since pictures look very low quality on normal paper.    I tried cardstock and that is "okay." It looks like it is putting 2 layers of ink on the paper, the first layer is fine, the second layer does not dry, so I have a bunch of wet spots all over the image and when it is touched it smears everywhere.    then i decided to get crazy with it to see what i could figure out (im curious, im sorry).    If i take paper (any type) and spray it with spray paint (light or heavy) then print on top of that the ink will not dry. wet and smears everywhere.    If i print on cardboard (think like the thin cardboard from a clothes box) the ink is wet and smears.    if i print on tape (duct, painters, scotch, clear, any type really) the ink is wet and smears    if i print on any type of plastic (basically whatever i could feed through the printer without damage) the ink is wet and smears    if i print on glossy paper (like magazine paper) the ink is wet and smears.    if i print on gift wrapping paper the ink stays wet.    playing cards (like bicycle 52 card deck type) the ink stays wet    playing cards (like pokemon/yugioh cards) the ink stays wet    so basically anything i try and print on besides normal white paper the ink just doesnt stick. i have tried OEM ink cartridges, 3rd party ink carts (like office max brand) and refilled ink carts all have the same result.      so basically at this point i just want to know if anyone knows how to dry ink that just doesnt want to dry. the images look fine, then just stay wet and smear, so if i can just get them to dry out ill be a happy camper.  any ideas?      **TL/DR:** Ink wet. How to dry ink?

Think about it:1. Sandy Hook (And really any other shooting) - Who is going to stop it, you? 2. Assuming that you would want to get rid of the police and think you could stop tragedies, do you own a gun to go up against a shooter?3. Maybe you think increased gun control is the answer? There wouldn't be anyone around to enforce it.Just curious, as yesterday my inbox blew up with people implying that LEO's do no good for the communities they live in. So I want to know how you think we would get by without any police force.EDIT: Just putting one line of thought to go through up there. Please discuss any situations you can think of!

1ik7cb	-30354	1374158443	reloading	Best Powder for reloading 5.56?	Title pretty much says it all. I'm looking to get into reloading, and since powder and primers seem to be hard to get your hands on I want to make sure I can buy some if the right stuff becomes available somewhere. So, what powder would you recommend for reloading 5.56? Are there any certain primers you are particularly fond of as well?EDIT: Thanks for the recommendations. I've set email alerts for these powders with midwayusa in case they get any in stock. Any other good places to look? Also, what are the chances of LGS's carrying powder and primers?One more edit for those of you saying use whatever you could find: I did find some IMR powder in stock at Cabela's. From what I can find with a bit of Google-fu [it looks like the 4320 may work for .223?](http://www.cabelas.com/product/Shooting/Reloading/Reloading-Powder-Primers-Accessories%7C/pc/104792580/c/104761080/sc/333152280/IMR-Smokeless-Powder-Rifle/731900.uts?destination=%2Fcatalog%2Fbrowse%2Freloading-powder-primers-accessories%2F_%2FN-1109591%2FNs-CATEGORY_SEQ_333152280%3FWTz_l%3DSBC%253BMMcat104792580%253Bcat104761080&amp;amp;WTz_l=SBC%3BMMcat104792580%3Bcat104761080%3Bcat333152280) If someone can confirm before I buy any I'd really appreciate it. I tend to prefer heavier bullets, so assume 65 grain and up.Last edit: midway seems to have gotten CCI #41 primers in stock at some point tonight (5000 count). Thanks to you guys I managed to get powder and primers ordered today and should have everything to start reloading by next Friday!

1iw8bp	-30354	1374599550	longrange	What is some good reading I can do to learn some of the more basics of long range shooting?	So I'm pretty new to the world of shooting (Particularly actually shooting at a range) but have been going very regularly for the past month or two. Probably an average of 2 trips to the range a week.The range I go to has a 300 yard rifle range, I have been sticking to shooting at 100 yards but the last couple trips have reached out to 300 for the last bit of my time there.I have two rifles, an [AR-15 by Anderson MFG - pretty much this but without the paint job](http://www.andersonrifles.net/index.php/shop-rifles/view-our-rifles/am15-m416-camo.html), and a [Ruger American in 30-06.](http://www.ruger.com/products/americanRifle/specSheets/6901.html). I realize that neither of these will do for real long range shooting, but I figure I can practice the basics with them until I can save up for a proper gun for the job.Right now I can pretty easily keep the AR in a 3" groups at 100 yards using surplus M855 ammo. From the discussions I've read on this ammo I'm under the impression that this is about as good as can be expected out of that ammo.With the Ruger, I have been able to keep 2ish" groups at 100 yards using the cheapest ammo I could find on the shelves - Although I have shot this rifle very little, probably only 40 rounds to date. Most of my shooting is with the AR simply because the rounds cost half as much.I've also ordered all the materials and equipment needed to start handloading the .223, and within a month or so with purchase dies for .30-06. My understanding is that once I develop proper handloads my groupings should be much tighter (assuming I'm shooting well of course).So I guess the two main things I'd like answered are:1. What are some good resources to learn proper technique, etc for long range shooting? Would also love any good reading on adjusting for wind, as the range I go to tends to be pretty windy and the wind likes to change direction quite a bit.2. Once I am handloading all the ammo I shoot, what size grouping would you guys consider acceptable out of these rifles?Sorry that was so long, just wanted to try and include any information you guys might need to know.
1jzk3x	-30354	1376000947	reloading	168 grain AMAX bullets	Hey all,I was wondering if anyone knew what kind of performance the Hornady 168 grain AMAX bullets had in large game (deer is what I have in mind).I'm hoping to go hunting for the first time this year, and am hoping that I can use the same cartridge for target and hunting. Right now I'm getting sub MOA out of the AMAX in my Ruger American, so it would be very convenient if these bullets are ethical to use on larger game.Thanks in advance.EDIT: sounds like the general consensus is that it can work but you wouldn't recommend it, which is kind of what I figured. I guess I'll be on the hunt for a hunting bullet that I can get on a similar trajectory to the AMAX. Or if anyone knows of a hunting bullet that works well for accuracy on targets also I could just go to using that for both. Thanks guys.

1pp8pj	-30354	1383328614	guns	As long as we're talking meetups, would anyone be interested in an NC meetup before winter really sets in?	I'm definitely game to organize it, but would need someone to either provide or suggest a place for it. The range I go to just does not have the facilities for more than a few people at a time.EDIT: Don't just upvote, say something. If we're going to make this happen, like I said, we need to find a suitable place. That will require discussion. It would also be nice to have a general count of who would like to go, dates that could work, etc. Personally, I can make literally any weekend work (except the occasional sunday morning is spoken for when I set up at church). Even then I can probably get someone to cover my role to make this happen.So, **say something, anything** if you'd actually like to see this happen

I'm planning on building a 300BLK SBR or pistol in the near future which will primarily be a HD weapon and range toy.

For the most part it works great, but with some of my slimmer fitting tshirts it doesn't quite work out.I'm pretty sure if I could find a mag without that little pinky finger rest on it that it would conceal much better under a tshirt. Only issue is that as far as I can tell Bersa doesn't make one. Do any of you know of someone that maybe makes aftermarket base plates that I could swap out? Any ideas would be helpful.
2lvvzh	-30354	1415646835	guns	Cabin weekend (or how I got about a dozen people to learn to love busting clay pigeons)	Just as a preface, I live in a pretty liberal college town - so a large portion of my friends have no to little experience with guns. I spent this past weekend with the majority of my "community group" from church at a lake-house in the blue ridge mountains. There were 15 of us total, about 10 of whom had little to no experience with guns and whose attitude towards them ranged from uneasy to pretty damn nervous around them.The guy who owned the lakehouse had mentioned that he had a clay thrower set up on the deck, so I brought my 20g Mossberg 500, several hundred rounds of birdshot, some extra eye pro and a tub of foam plug ear pro. The owner supplied all the clays. I had never actually had a chance to shoot clays before [so I was pretty excited about the opportunity to do it with one hell of a view in the background.](http://imgur.com/lirHXA1)When saturday afternoon came around I started getting things set up, expecting it to mainly just be me and a handful of folks that might want to give it a shot later on. This turned out to be a pretty big underestimate, because about the time I finished laying things out I turned around to see all but two standing behind me.I spent a few minutes passing out ear pro, and explaining to the guys that thought they would be fine without it why they needed it. Two people still declined, I left them to it with the warning that they would sustain permanent hearing damage and that I needed them to understand that before we started shooting. After a few shots had been fired one decided to put some ear pro on after all. After a brief explanation on how the flow of things would go, I took the first 3-4 shots myself so I could get the hang of it before trying to teach people how to hit the clays.After that, the rest of the group started coming up one by one, I'd walk them through how to handle, shoulder, aim, and manipulate the shotgun - then I'd stand just behind them to the right (within arms reach of the gun, just in case) and keep and eye on them and give pointers as they were shooting.At times I got a little frustrated with how little I was able to shoot, but seeing the grins on everyone's face after they would break the clay and enthusiastically rack the pump brought me more joy than actually shooting did. By the end of Sunday afternoon everyone that shot had managed to hit at least one, which I think was the most rewarding part of it for me.I know this is getting pretty long, but I wanted to share a few things that I took away/learned from this experience:* Even with such a large group, it was very easy to manage safely and keep a decent pace of things. I believe this was largely due to the fact that the shooting occurred within the larger context of just generally spending time with each other for the weekend. Everyone was able to come and go as they pleased, or just sit out on the deck and enjoy each other's company while they waited their turn.* My, at times overzealous, attention to safety and structure enabled even the most scared/nervous folks in our group to relax, learn, and enjoy themselves. At times I felt like I was being too overbearing (the only people I would not watch like a hawk and basically stand over top of was a marine and my girlfriend, who I've shot with before and I trust to be safe), but multiple people told me that I enabled them to relax and enjoy themselves - essentially they didn't have to worry about it because they could tell I had everything under control.* Several folks that were uncomfortable at first *really* opened up and enjoyed themselves when we had a chance to discuss the mechanical aspects of how the gun actually worked, along with when I cut open a shell to show them what goes on inside it/the barrel.* It's hard to describe the right sight picture with a bead sight. You need to be pretty descriptive and adjust your explanation for each person as you talk to them. It also helps to have them shoot at something stationary so you can verify they are aiming properly.* Everyone was more successful when I told them to let their instincts do more of the work. As long as you've got the right sight picture, your body is pretty good at just reacting to what you're seeing and getting you on target. Overthinking where you're aiming led to a lot of missing, and when people just started reacting and pulling the trigger they started hitting a lot more.* Bring a pump if you've got newer shooters with you. We also had a semi available, but everyone enjoyed the pump far and away more. I had a couple people that at first only seemed to enjoy it for the pump, and then as they shot started enjoying the whole process.[I was unfortunately too busy supervising to take photos, but here is me up to bat \(sorry for potato, this was close to dusk](http://imgur.com/317jcY9)). The shotgun pictured is the first gun I ever shot and the first I ever purchased. I just got the wood stock and forend in last week from brownells, so I was really excited to take it out for a spin now that it's looking sexy.

However, sound seems to "pop" or "crackle" or just skip during game play. Today I was playing AC: Unity and around once a minute there would be a "pop" and the sound would resume shortly after.I was wondering if anyone has dealt with similar issues (have seen it mentioned in other reviews but was surprised to see the issue not brought up more). I will try to update with other game/TV performance. I did notice the "pop" while playing Sunset Overdrive as well but want to give some better feedback before commenting. Also if it helps the headset receiver unit is positioned in between my Roku &amp; Kinect (about 8 inches either way). I read earlier that interference from other wireless devices could cause this.Any help or feedback is greatly appreciated.

I have made a few purchases on the Microsoft Store &amp; was wondering why I didn't get credit for a first purchase. I got this response:To qualify for the 1st Xbox Stores Purchase Offer, your purchase must be made using your local currency on your Microsoft account. Since the purchase was not made with the cash in your Microsoft account and was made via a debit/credit card or PayPal, it was not eligible for the offer. Your purchase did count towards your MyVIP. Once you reach the first threshold your Star level will be unlocked. Once you make a purchase with the cash balance on your Microsoft account, 1250 Rewards Credits will be added.

2sbvhs	-30372	1421186813	DragonAgeCoOp	Quick Class Questions for New Player	Hi all. I got DAI over holidays &amp; had a general question about classes for multiplayer. I have a decent amount of experience from past games (D3, WoW, SWTOR, etc.) &amp; understand the basics.My main question is: any recommendations based on what is overpowered or (more to my point) what is underpowered? After looking at this sub I couldn't get an overall consensus (although it seemed in general most the mage classes were strong). This goes back to my gut feeling in DAO where mages were essentially better warriors that, well, warriors. More than likely I will try out a DD rogue spec. My question here is the effort for melee dps really worth it over ranged? This probably goes to personal preferences but wanted to hear some opinions.Thanks for your time.

2x9igv	-30372	1424978419	xboxone	So how does metacritic work exactly?	Ok, I get the basis. But here's where my curiosity got me.I was reading http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2015/02/23/five-things-didnt-get-making-video-games The guy mentioned giving Twilight Princess a 4/10 (3 reviewers gave it a 8.5, 8, &amp; 4 for an average of ~6.83). http://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-review-the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-28572.phtmlI checked out the metacritic for Twilight Princess: an average of 95 littered with glowing 100's &amp; 90+ with the lowest being a single 78 &amp; a few 80s. Nothing below a 70. http://www.metacritic.com/game/wii/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess/critic-reviews&amp; couldn't find the review. I'm assuming destructoid isn't an obscure review source (their scores have been used before such as MCC). So what gives? Why did a sub-70 score from a pretty well known publication get skipped. I like Nintendo games. I am not trying to point out some conspiracy or whatnot. But when I browse Nintendo games I see ridiculously high scores, scores that seem inflated. Maybe this was just the odd duck they skipped but I would love to hear your opinions.

It does everything the BF2 server browser did, and more.Not only that, but it helps you get into a game faster.  In BF2, the time required to launch the game, log in, refresh the server list, connect, and load a server felt like an eternity.  Even compared to the process in BC2 it's hands down faster and more streamlined.  For this reason alone, the new web-based server browser gets a WIN in my book: it's both fully featured, and faster.

l1wbq	-30375	1317835029	battlefield3	After a night of attempting support class, I found a tip I wanted to add to the list of "how to play support correctly."	Pimp my MCOM.Strategic use of C4.  The C4 ammo replenishes so quickly from the ammo drop, you can make short work of many things.  Check out this before and after shot.  With all the cover approaching the MCOM destroyed, it was nearly impossible for the attackers to get it armed.  It took me 30 seconds to do and it substantially increases the defensiblity of the point.  If you have C4, USE IT :)[before](http://i.imgur.com/TqKBF.jpg)[after](http://i.imgur.com/fqI7W.jpg)Notice even the sandbags and benches on the far side of the playground are gone.  Nowhere to hide from my SAW!

l8jk3	-30375	1318356979	BMW	E90 335i, question about oil	I drive ~20k miles a year almost entirely freeway miles, and oil changes have been few and far between (the car asks for an oil change about every 8-10 months).  This is my first experience with synthetic oil so I'm a little out of my depth here, but is it normal to burn through a quart or two of oil between changes with this engine?  About halfway between oil changes, after 10k or so, I find myself a quart low and have to go in for a top-off, and when it finally decides it's time for a full oil change, it is also pretty low again by that point.Is this usual for the N54 engine?  Or should I take it in for a good look before the warranty expires?  For what it's worth, I've never noticed an oil spots on the ground when I pull out of the garage.

Is it just me, or can you spend an entire round on Seine Crossing (even the smaller one), pumping mortar after mortar at the team, with decent spotting support, and earn fewer kills than if you ran around like a maniac with just a knife?I've tried it a few times, and other than killing a few stationary vehicles, I came up more or less dry.  Maybe 4-6 infantry kills if I was lucky, sometimes as few as 1.  What gives, am I doing it wrong?My main question is about the reticle.  Is it pretty accurate?  Does it fire on the aim spot where you click, or if you move before the animation finished and it actually launches, does it update post-click?

m3ra7	-30375	1320690535	battlefield3	Do you use the heavy barrel?  Why?	There have been a bunch of loadout threads the past few days and I see a lot of people using the heavy barrel, and other than maybe with a sniper rifle (which im not even sure you can do), I just don't see the use.  I've never had trouble with long distance accuracy with the rifles and the added recoil is a a noticeable deterrant, so I ask, why do you use it? Am I missing something?The only use for it I could image is with a lmg and a bipod, but they are reasonably accurate without it and id take the extended mag any day.
mgc6m	-30375	1321576897	battlefield3	What's with all the shit-talking pilots?	You're going to try to trash talk me be calling me a "circle turning bitch?"  Seriously?  Well I don't really want to get shot down, so I'm going to turn the tightest damn circles I can, and I'm not going to stop until you mess up, make a mistake, and leave yourself open for the kill.  I'm Iceman like that, so complain all you want, but if you can't play with the big boys, maybe find another pastime.No but seriously, until a week and, most "good" or better pilots were rather friendly, but the past few days I've seen in onslaught of skilled pilots who carry themselves like douche-nozzles.  They'll rape you at the base, they'll shoot you down mercilessly, but the instant you get behind them and score even just a minor hit, the eject and talk shit the whole way down, complaining about how I fly or making some reference to the joystick I don't even use.If I wanted to play with a bunch of foul mouthed e-taints, I'd have bought it on a console (not saying all console players, there's just usually a lot less "fag!" being thrown around on PC).TL;DR - If you call someone names for out flying you, you're the moron.

All you have to do is point at something to paint it, right?The TV missiles - do they one-hit-kill tanks like they did in BF2?  I've read many accounts that they do so to helicopters, but how much damage they do to tanks/LAVs/AAA?Guided rockets - do they need to be painted to work?  Who does the painting, the pilot, or a gunner/SOFLAM/CITV?I haven't quite unlocked most of this stuff yet, but I'd like to know how excited I should be to reach these goals.Thanks.edit - also, TV missiles again, how do they stear?  Is it point and click like in BF2?
pfowu	-30375	1328670654	battlefield3	My new Top BF3 Moment	Caspian Border (Rush) 48 man server, full.  Defending last set of MCOMS, flying the SU25.Shot down a full UH1 as it was circling over our last MCOM covering the plant and one of their tanks directly under who was also covering the plant.  The UH1 crashed down into the tank, killing everyone aboard the chopper and everyone who bailed as well as destroying the tank and killing the crew at the same time.1,020 points for one vehicle kill!  And, with nearly half of their team dead at once, someone on my side managed a disarm.  It was at that point I got called a cheater, a hacker, a "control injector" user (whatever that is), as well as some colorfull racial slurs.  It seemed to make them even more mad when I shared that I only use the keyboard, no fancy joystick.My team wound up winning the round, with that one MCOM left, and it was our first win in the 4 rounds I'd been on the server.  The other team was real good, they used the vehicles well enough that I expect they were working together over TS.  But they didn't have a pilot who could shoot me down, so once I got in the air the match was much closer.
q1af3	-30375	1329938315	Tribes	How about a nitron boosting/disc jumping tutorial for a n00b pathfinder?	If there's already a good one out there, please link me to it.What I'm interested are the technical details.  When is the best time to nitron boost?  At the base of the hill, or at the top?  Should you hit the jump/jet key before it goes off or after?I read somewhere that turning around and throwing it behind you is best for boosting speed and throwing it straight down while looking forward is good for altitude, when is it recommended to do either of these?I've not experimented with disc jumping, what are the strengths of this technique?Thanks!  I just got this game last week and I'm loving it.  I never played the original Tribes but I was aware of it when it was around, and it always sounded like fun.  Something about skiing around at high speed and jet-jumping is incredibly fun, reminds me a lot of dreaming.
rqh3h	-30375	1333416695	battlefield3	Here's how to fix the patch, re:attachements:	Swap the spread and recoil affects of the foregrip and the silencer.BAM.  Fixed, done.Why does the silencer make things more accurate?  Why does the foregrip make things less accurate?  It just doesn't make sense, and it renders the foregrip useless on all but 4 or 5 (non LMG) weapons.  The foregrip should make the weapon easier to control, end of story.Either that or just de-nerf the foregrip altogether.  Seriously, looking at Symthic's plots, there are only 4 or 5 weapons it doesn't make matters worse for.  "It needs a down side?"  The trade off was you couldn't use the underslung rail.  I think that's plenty.  Why on earth do I find myself loading out the underslung rail when I don't even want to use it, because the foregrip is that bad?Sorry for the rant.  Seriously though, all this would be much easier to take if it wasn't 3 months between patches.[SOURCE](http://i.imgur.com/7OHnO.jpg)
112fkg	-30375	1349570487	BMW	n54 "Walnut Blast"	Had to read the work invoice twice to make sure I got it right, but I just got my car back and man, I couldn't be happier.  Some google research taught me that this procedure should really be regularly performed every 40-50k due to regular carbon build up, but I had never heard of it and had no idea, and I'm at 60k.The build up had gotten so bad it had actually started locking the intake valves in place when I hit it with full throttle.  Talk about unpleasant at freeway speeds, but even more unnerving at idle.  Luckily shutting the engine off for a moment would un-stick the valve the two times it happened before I got it in to the shop later that day.What a world of difference.  If you have a 335 or 135 with the n54 engine, are over 50k miles, and have no idea what a walnut blast is, definitely look into it.Info and a DIY guide if you're into that:http://www.e90post.com/forums/showthread.php?t=682116

This has always worked best for me, but starting a month ago (maybe longer, I don't play so often since they ruined the air controls...) the game has been completely unplayable, averaging 2 - 7 FPS in all states, from the log in menu right through to gameplay.When I enable SLI for the game, it resolves the worst part of the problems, but then I'm left with shitty SLI problems like hitching and drastic volatility.  I'd rather just use the one card and keep things steady.Anyone else seeing this problem?  They are 780s, and I'm using newest drivers.  It's a driving me nuts, if I can't get this working soon it'll be the last straw that finally breaks my subscription....Bonus details: the mouse cursor is clearly updating at a much faster FPS than the game display, well over 60FPS, but the game is choppy as hell and FRAPS reads anywhere from 0 - 8 FPS at all times.

There's no way I'm going to deal with the hassle of a daily or weekly boost.

Having updated a few Movie and TV Show files and seen them updated on the Xbox One it looks like it's just a problem with the Home Videos. Is this a known problem and if so is there a fix?
2rjryo	-30385	1420575815	Alienware	Deleted Alpha Console login, can no longer enter Console Mode.	I made the mistake of using the supplied Microsoft Recovery USB stick rather than Alienware's own recovery files after upgrading my hard drive. This led to the console effectively loading as a desktop. Stupidly I decided to delete the Alpha Console user profile so even after downloading the various Alpha applications from the Dell website I still can't regain access to Console Mode; the furthest I get is getting into the AlphaUI application, clicking Console Mode then returning to my own User Profile login upon the system restarting. Have I completely fucked this up?

2xeou5	-30385	1425079649	Alienware	The internet on my Alpha has crapped out...	So a few days ago I started having problems logging into Steam. I kept getting prompted to start offline and assumed some hacker nerds had taken it down and thought nothing of it. The same happened the next day, and the next, with Steam occasionally connecting several minutes after I'd already logged in offline. Then today, having entered desktop mode to download some stuff, I noticed download estimates (that were until this week getting done in a couple minutes) rocketing up to three hours and more. I just tried playing a Giant Bomb stream and I could barely make it a couple seconds without it buffering. I didn't make any changes and my other PC (wired) is fine, as are all my other internet-connected devices. Any ideas what the problem is? EDIT: Just as I posted this it (perhaps unrelated) just beeped, something I've noticed a couple times over the last week. Not sure if that means anything. 
34exsw	-30385	1430410377	AlienwareAlpha	Is there some reason why my internet sucks?	I've been experiencing this problem for months now but because I use the Alpha primarily in game mode I had always blamed the constant poor connections on Steam. But now having tried downloading stuff in desktop mode I'm finding that the internet connection is abysmal, reducing download times for even 20mb files to 15-20 minutes. The console is connected wirelessly to my router but seems to have a dramatically different connection to all my other wireless-connected devices. I'm wondering if this is a particular problem for the Alpha or something related to driver issues; as I said, this is a problem that only seems to have appeared recently, having performed fine downloading my Steam library when I first purchased the device. Any help would be appreciated.

I was not a smoker but one day my mum came to me and asked 'Mike, have you been smoking?'Confused and honest i replied 'No...why?''Well, ive been finding stumped out cigarettes by our front door' she said accusingly'Then surely they're Dave's' i said thinking of my step Dad who smokes'It cant be, he only smokes roll-ups and the ones outside are cigarettes.''Then it must be the neighbours throwing them into our front garden' i said puzzled'It cant be the neighbours since there's loads of them and all of them have been stump out against the door step'We both were confused and left the conversation like that, we never talked about it again and we kept finding stumped out cigs by our front door. I was never sure if my mum believed me or not.Nothing else happened for a few months later when i was talking to my real Dad who of course doesn't live with me. He told me that he was recently walking past my home when he saw something odd, he saw a mysterious women crying and smoking cigarettes on my door step! He didn't talk to her, he just kept walking.     I told my Mum about this thinking it could be related to the cigarettes. My mum was puzzled but assumed it was one of her friends, well maybe it was.Another few months later i moved out of my Mum's house and in with my Dad. After living with him for a few month he comes to me and asked  'Mike, have you been smoking? I've been finding stumped out cigarettes by the front door...'This gave me the shits and i didn't ask any question or look into further. This was a long time ago and i have since moved to London, but I still worry that one day ill live my home and find more stumped out cigarettes

Remember seeing that oh-so-memorable scene at the end of S4E4 'Oathkeeper'?  Baby is picked up, carried, placed on altar, and the eyes turn blue upon the touch of King Walker.Suspending my disbelief, this means that either the original white walker has some method of keeping the baby warm, happy, and alive for the weeks / months of walking it takes to get from Craster's keep (60 miles north of the wall) to the Lands of Always Winter, or that the Others are somehow hiding a gigantic Minas Morgul with outdoor altar somewhere within a day or so walk from Craster's.It might just be a plot hole from the show, but it was interesting to me.  There is a lot of emphasis placed on distances north of the wall (Jon's ranging with Qhorin, the wildling army, Bran's voyage, Sixskins running etc.) so this seems really odd.What does the ASOIAF community think?

2id6qy	-30402	1412526341	keto	[NSV] My bitchiness followed the carbs out the door.	I have been following a ketogenic approach to eating(doubt i'm in ketosis yet) for about two weeks now. After years of yo-yo diets, bulimia, chronic fatigue, and extremely unstable moods since I hit puberty, I can already tell I have found the best approach to both weight-loss and health improvement for my body. I've seen many benefits in my short time already- plenty of energy/no more need for the morning coffee, no more bloating (which I'm convinced was my body inflaming from a negative reaction to carbs all this time), and yes, weight loss. But the best change that my body/mind has seen?I'M SO MUCH NICER!!!I have always, always been snarky and grouchy. I've heard myself say rude and/or mean things to people I love out of annoyance too frequently. I can be extremely cold and terribly off-putting, especially to the people I don't know. It's not like I've lost my personality- I'm still quite sarcastic and make smart comments, but appropriately and not aimed to tear others down. I wasn't necessarily a mean person, I just was chronically in a bad mood and would make reactionary statements. Since changing my diet and having more energy, I am seeing all these changes and I really like who I am becoming. I am much more pleasant to be around and much more functional in situations with other people, like work and school. Has anyone else had an experience like this? This is the best decision and change I have ever made for myself.

2jtmas	-30402	1413838954	keto	a tip i learned today to help avoiding gross-for-you oils as a ranch dressing lover	I love ranch dressing (and all the yummy veggie dressings) but I am not a fan of soybean oil and it's questionable omega ratios/free radicals/inflammation, which is the first and primary ingredient listed on the majority of aisle shelf salad dressings. If you go to the produce section, there are refrigerated salad dressings with the produce, but about half of them (at least at my grocery) are just the same stuff in fancy packaging. The best route I've found is purchasing the veggie "dips", which are sour cream and not oil based. Of course the one I bought today still contains canola oil, but it is listed muuuch farther down the line. Of course, the most preferred method would be to purchase a ranch spice pack (in the aisle with the salad dressings) and mix it with sour cream... but I am very lazy. Hope everyone is having a happy Monday!

Hey guys, so recently I have entered by first plateau (read: i'm weighing everything, logging everything, yada yada, I am just accepting it right now) in terms of scale weight loss. However, over these last two weeks, although I lost minimal scale weight (2lbs combined, likely just fluctuation) I have noticed that my body has been feeling more... shapely? I feel more attractive. Maybe it is just higher energy or improved mood from all the keto goodness, but I'm feeling great! And the floppy bits seem... less floppy. Starting Sunday I will start experimenting with IF to try and bust this plateau. Thanks everyone for their support and inspiration, as always!

Not until January 1st, which is in quite a while, because he is in an eating disorder therapy treatment group in which diets that promote heavy food control are discouraged, at least at the beginning. He has been successful losing weight in the past on a vegan diet and an extreme, doctor controlled all protein shake diet. He has been overweight all my life, and has been trying to lose weight as long as I can remember. After explaining my successes on it (I focused more on my overall well-being and energy rather than weight loss) and the biochemical facts over breakfast this morning, he says he will try it if I help him and plan out his meals. It will be a bit of a struggle because I don't live with my parents, but I live nearby and will definitely checking in for moral support. Can't wait to share this lifestyle that has revolutionized the way I live with someone so important to me!

2ldywy	-30402	1415210901	xxketo	[SV] So close to onederland!	11 lbs, 5 weeks! Weighed in at 200.2 this morning. No exercise. I have NEVER lost weight with diet alone before keto. Also, I expect I'll be in the 100's next week as I am on the last day of my period and I always lose more weight the first week off my cycle. Thank you everyone here! This is the most manageable nutrition lifestyle I've ever experienced. The NSV's are countless (energy, mood, mental clarity) but it is nice to see the scale move, too :)

(1/4 cup), Dry Roasted Salted Sunflower Seeds* 8.00 slice (10g), Thick Cut Bacon - Hardwood Smoked, Sugar Cured* 2.00 large, Eggs - Whole, raw* 5.00 oz, Honey Ham Steaks* 3 cloves garlic, minced* 0.50 cup(s), Cream - Heavy whipping (whipped)* 3.00 oz Spoodle, Yellow Squash* 2.00 Cup (28g), Sharp Cheddar* 2.00 cube, Bouillon Cubes Chicken Flavor (powder probably better to use)* 1.00 container (348 gs ea.), Broccoli Cuts Frozen (or raw, your preference. Just should be cooked before put in casserole.) * 0.50 cup(s), Mayonaise* 4.00 oz. (28g 1/8 package, Cream CheesePreheat oven to 350F!* 1) Chop bacon into small pieces and pan fry; drain. * 2) In a large bowl, mix softened cream cheese, mayonnaise, eggs, crushed bouillon cubes, cream, garlic half of the cooked bacon bits, and half of the cheddar (1 cup.) I used an immersion blender.* 3) Chop ham into cubes, cook broccoli. Chop yellow squash if you're including it. I suggest spreading the broccoli and squash on a baking sheet and putting it in the oven for 10 minutes to dry it out some before putting it in the casserole. * 4) Coat loaf pan (I used a lasagna pan) with butter. * 5) Start with a bottom layer of the cheese mixture, and layer your ingredients as you like. * 6) On top of the last cheese mixture layer, spread the remaining bacon bits and the sunflower seeds to create a nice "crust".* 7) Bake at 350F for ~1 hour.When you pull it out, it will still be very moist. However, it settles a lot as it cools, and tastes even better as leftovers. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did! * [pic](http://i.imgur.com/KFFsrqr.jpg) I was dumb and didn't take a picture of it after it was baked... but believe me, the bacon crust is beaaautiful.* [MFP info](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/recipe/view/28329083948973)* edit: formatting

3cn1nm	-30402	1436416071	keto	Salad strategie	How do y'all approach digging in to your salads? Myself, I tell myself "don't eat too much of the cheese and meat first, or else you'll end up with a bunch of extra lettuce" and go for the lettuce first, getting forkfuls with toppings placed sparingly. Then I take that too far and end up eating just cheese and nuts and bacon and meat and yummyness for the last ten forkfuls. I'm curious to hear how it works out for you guys. STRATEGY* ugh
3cq1cv	-30402	1436476824	keto	[mini-rant] Old Food Pyramid	Why did the old food pyramid have carbs as the largest daily serving in the first place? Even without LCHF knowledge, it makes more sense to me that they would have had vegetables at the bottom. I always thought that the largest amount of my food should come from veggies, way before keto. Doesn't that fit common sense more than grains? 
3csyme	-30402	1436540269	keto	Steak noob	I'm considering cooking some steak some time this week, a task I wouldn't have taken on pre-keto (I'm a grad student with limited culinary talent, lol.) Does anyone have any preferences, recommendations on the cut, how you cook it, compound butters, etc...? All I know is I'm going to try to cook it to medium because the blood of anything rarer ruins my appetite but apparently cooking a steak to well done "ruins it".

However, when I'm working, the stuff I can get for free/is offered to me is not so friendly: free fry refills, messed up pizza, the free breadsticks we give out with salads. Of course it's never a salad that's messed up and I can scarf down in the back. I've stayed pretty strong the last few weeks of my second keto venture, and I want to give props to all you other people pretending that carby-dish sitting on the break table isn't even there. Go us! Sidenote- on my first keto venture, I was working as a baker for a sandwich shop. Baking cookies and bread from 4am-noon. That may be where I got this iron willpower :P

Is it safe to assume that because there's 0g sugar listed, and erythritol is a main ingredient, that most if not all of those carbs come from sugar alcohols? I usually try to stay away from artificial sweeteners and save those items as a treat, it's in the upper 80's rn where I am and I am absolutely craving a summer slurpee! 
3e3qar	-30402	1437504622	xxketo	CLOTHES CLOTHES CLOTHES!	hey keto ladies, I'm moving in about three weeks and I've decided to get an early start on clothes packing because, well... I am a skinny-clothes hoarder. As in, as I've gained weight over the last few years, I've kept a lot of the clothes I liked after I've grown out of them because I'll fit into them "someday". WELL, thanks to keto,  I feel that "someday" actually approaching instead of just floating in the distance. So as I started packing today, I sorted my skinny clothes into three boxes: one for each of my two next goal weights (185 and 170) and then a "beyond" box. I'm using my best judgement of the sizes and when I remember wearing those clothes before. So when I hit my goals, I'll get to open up a big box like it's my birthday, and have my own mini fashion show!a contributing factor to my extreme excess of too-small clothing is my fear/anxiety of trying on clothes in stores, a direct result of my body image and weight issues. Anyone else end up with extra clothes that don't fit because you couldn't get yourself to try them on in store? 
3egr9a	-30402	1437757781	keto	Anyone experience benefits from reducing dairy?	It's something I've been considering after reading some successes of keto-ers combining paleo and keto. I also feel like cheese and cream is where I tend to go overboard. I don't think it's realistic for me to cut it out completely, but I'm considering reducing my dairy intake. Anyone who has cut it out and noticed anything beneficial in terms of weight loss, health, bloating, general overall well-being? 
3fkwkx	-30402	1438573457	keto	Saying goodbye to cheese	It is just something I have to do. I started my second round of keto 6 weeks ago, this time being being more observant of what is healthy and unhealthy for me. I just can't control myself with cheese, eating way too many calories and not properly tracking when it comes to cheese. After cutting it out for a while, I will probably reintroduce it slowly. It's not you, cheese, it's me. You will always be my first love.
3g0pvx	-30402	1438878012	keto	[NSV] Diabetic Dad is gonna try keto because of my success.	My dad has always been overweight (6'4"/340), but he went vegan like 2 years back and lost about 50 lbs. Although he lost weight, it was an unsustainable lifestyle for him. He also went on a doctor-facilitated all protein shake diet for 2 months (which was torturous for him AND us), lost some weight, but quickly gained it back. He is currently type II diabetic and really, really looking for something to work this time. I no longer live with them, but will be staying with them for the last two weeks in August while I'm between leases at school. We had a long talk about all the benefits of keto that I've experienced and he's willing to try it! I said I would cook for him for three days to make things easier to start. I hope it is something that sticks. Does anyone have any advice for me? He weighs about 150 lbs more than me and while I am going to make a meal plan, I am just not used to planning for that many calories. I will be using the keto calculator of course. He works from home so taking snacks  or lunches to go won't be such a problem- I think he may struggle when he is home alone around all of the carbs in the house for my mom and brother.TL;DR is pretty much just the title! Also he is internet-savvy and a redditor so look out for a new /r/keto pal! 
1a3wks	-30405	1363039894	AskFeminists	What tropes should i avoid?	Hi there. My name is CML Minton. I think i'm posting this to Ask Feminists, but i am very, very new to Reddit (I quite literally just made this account, though i have lurked for some time now). I made this account because I am a writer, or at least i hope to be soon, and I'm currently writing a series of Novels with a female protagonist. The book didn't start out this way; I decided to change the gender of the protagonist recently, and for the most part, i think its for the better. It's almost entirely written now, but before i say its done, i want to get some feedback. I've had a couple of my friends read it (both male and female) and they tend not to have a lot to add to what may be what worries me the most.I don't want to write a stereotype. I don't want, in X years, to find my Book on TVtropes and go to the YMMV page to see "Unfortunate Implications". What are the tropes that piss Feminists off the most, why do they piss you off, and how do I avert them? PS: if this isn't the place to ask these questions (Again, i'm new to Reddit) could you please point me to the proper Reddit? Thank you.

I can't see this post in the Stream on the main page, and i'm not sure if there's some kind of time lag, or if my computer crapped out, or if it just didn't go through for some reason.Edit: I don't know why I didn't add anything about the actual Story, that was kinda dumb. Its called "Strange World" although that is very, very much a working title. The protagonist is Casey Smith, a fifteen year old high school student who is, after being attacked by a malevolent spirit, inducted into a world of the Supernatural and more or less drafted into a group of "Witch-Hunters" who hunt and destroy things like the thing that attacked her. The Universe draws heavily from Lovecraft, but i think a more direct comparison is White Wolf's World of Darkness RPG, which focuses on how societies of things like Vampires, Werewolves, Psychics and Mages would actually function internally and interact, with the Supernatural Elements being a backdrop for political intrigue. 
1aeyvv	-30405	1363452803	islam	Hi there, R/Islam. I'm doing research for a Muslim Character, and i need to Ask a few questions	Hi there. My name is CML Minton and i'm currently writing a book series, and one of the primary protagonists is a Muslim. I've been doing a lot of research, but occasionally i hit dead ends and conflicting information, and i don't feel i have enough understanding. I'm afraid i don't actually know any Muslims, so i can't ask them. I figure this is the next best thing. If you can, i'd like to ask a few questions, and I hope you'll help me. I feel like Islam doesn't have a good Media representation, and I'd like to change that.The character is named Zakariyya Ismail Saladin, and we'll start with that. I'm not entirely clear on the naming conventions of your faith, and i'm not entirely sure that names makes sense. The character isn't a born Muslim, He's a Black American convert who joined the Nation of Islam, and then later converted to Sunni Islam. That isn't a preference on my part, i know little of the distinctions. I only chose that path of conversion because it seemed to happen a lot with famous Black-American Muslims, like Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali. Also popular among Black converts was that he changed his name. Another thing i'd to ask is about things that are forbidden, or at least frowned upon, in Islam and among Muslims. I think the word is "Haram" or "Ribba", i've seen both used in this context. I understand that Muslims don't eat pork, but beyond that i get conflicting information. I understand that Alcohol is pretty much a big no-no in more or less every faith, but how strict is the average Muslim when it comes to that? Also, is smoking allowed? Another thing is prayer. I have every intention of showing the character praying and making it clear ritualistic prayer is a part of his daily routine, but i'm honestly not sure about the frequency. Does every Muslim pray five times a day? I've also noticed that in many pictures, Muslims (in this case, Muslim men) often aren't wearing the stereotypical garb that most media portrays them as wearing. So, what does the average Muslim male wear in his day-to-day life?I'm in the process in getting a copy of The Qur'an, (in English, which i understand is the point of some contention. The character may speak Arabic, but i do not) but i'm also interested in other Islamic literature, stuff that may not be canon, but is still widely known by Muslims. For example, most of what the average Catholic knows about Hell doesn't really come from the bible, but from Dante's Epic Poem, A Divine Comedy. Sam with Lucifer's fall and his eventual turn into Satan, which comes most John Milton's Paradise Lost.  I would imagine that Islam has similar literature, but I don't know where to start looking for it.And my last question is sort of a general question to Muslim Redditors. Like i said before, i understand that Muslims don't have a great representation in the Media and i am looking to change that. What are some general stereotypes of Muslims and Islam that you hate seeing in Media? I feel like I've averted most of the ones i'm familiar with. Zakariyya isn't a terrorist, he isn't a suicide bomber, and though i plan for his faith to be important to him, It's just a part of who he is. Though he is a soldier, he isn't naturally violent (In fact, part of his backstory is being ashamed of himself fighting in a war. He didn't have much of a choice; he was drafted in Vietnam. He tried to be a conscious objector, but they made him a Medic, which meant he was handed a gun like everyone else, and when threatened he used it.) The stories place him in violent situations where he has to fight for himself and others, but i intend to make it clear that he seriously doesn't want to be there, and he always tries to find non-violent resolutions to conflicts. He's also pretty tolerant, making it a point to respect the religions of others. So I think I've avoided all the major stereotypes, but I'd like to hear about some others if you can think of any.Anyway, thank you for your time. I'm sorry this is such a long post, but I'm pretty ignorant of Islam and i'd really like to know more.   PS: If there's a better place to post these questions, please tell me. I'm still pretty new to reddit.EDIT: I'd like to thank everyone for their comments. You've all been very helpful, and i think i've gotten answers to my questions, and I've got quite a few links to check out for more information. I'll be sure to come back here again if i need any more help.
1b1zls	-30405	1364321285	gamingsuggestions	I'm hoping to find a good PC RPG.	  So, for a while now, i've been seeking a good PC RPG. I've been through a lot of the "typical" ones.

1cylqy	-30405	1366750080	MensRights	Need help with Female Rapist Stats	Hey there MR. I've been lurking this site for some time now, but this is my first post.

1d840l	-30405	1367084107	Feminism	Female Villains: What's okay and what's not?	So, i'm an aspiring writer, currently writing what i hope will develop into a series of supernatural-adventure books centered around a female protagonist. A long time ago, i posted something [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/1a3wks/what_tropes_should_i_avoid/) asking about what i should and shouldn't do when it came to writing a female protagonist (as i am a man). Well, i like to think that i worked out all the kinks in the character, and i'm pretty sure that, if/when i publish, the story won't have an "Unfortunate Implications" in the YMMV tab on its Tvtropes page. But i'm not here to talk about protagonists. I finished writing the first book, and while i wait for editors and publishers to get back to me, i'm scripting the sequels. Now, i probably won't know until i start writing them, but there are two stories where i'd like to have a female villain. There doesn't seem to be as much written about the do's and don'ts of Feminine villains, so i'd like to ask you here at r/feminism.The only trope i can find that goes against feminist tenancies is the "Evil Demon Seductress" (Name courtesy of Feminist Frequency) where a female character uses her sexiness to manipulate men. I had absolutely no intention of using this character archetype. Not because its sexist, but because its kind of overused and boring. I don't think i need to go into background about the villains. I just need to know what tropes seem sexist when it comes to female villains; something like their abilities, their motivations, abilities, and so on. If i do need to give background for them, i will in the comments.
1dnodu	-30405	1367633479	anime	Looking for a follow up Anime.	So i've been getting back into Anime lately. I was big on it when i was younger, but when i left school and started working, I cut back. Not for any particular reason, just because. Well, i've been getting back into it lately. It started with the sudden urge to re-watch my favorite anime, Ghost In the Shell SAC. Then to finish watching animes that i lost interest in, mainly Darker Than Black and FMA: Brotherhood. Then to anime i'd never seen; Angel Beats, High School of The Dead, and Dance In The Vampire Bund.And i'd like to continue, but i can't find a good anime. Figured i'd come here to ask. I like anime with Supernatural, Psychological or Futuristic Elements, usually ones that are more serious in their tone, with the occasional laugh here and there for levity's sake. things like the aforementioned, but also Blood+, Code Geass, and Death Note, Cowboy Bebop, and NGE.I don't want this to be some kind of deciding factor, but most anime's i enjoy have somewhere around fifty episodes. I tried watching Bleach and couldn't get over just how slow it moved and how many episodes it needed; same thing with Naruto. Again, episode count isn't a deciding factor, so please don't avoid recommending a good show because it has 60+ episodes.  I prefer do Dubs, but i'll watch Subs from time to time.Anyway, i'd really appreciate a recommendation or two. Hopefully one day i can return the favor. 
1f0g08	-30405	1369452287	AskFeminists	Does the motive of Abortion matter?	So Abortion is a pretty big Feminist issue, and to my knowledge, Feminism is pretty pro-choice in general, if not always. And i'm all for that. But recently, when i was reading [this] (http://trettiotreanledningar.com/33-reasons-to-be-a-feminist/). The number 31 point is about how people in China abort their female babies because men are more valuable.And...that's wrong. That's morally reprehensible. But what can anyone do about it? I'm sure everyone's heard that old argument "I'm okay with Abortion if it posses a threat to the mother, or if its in cases of rape or incest..." but I've heard *many* Feminists [chime back] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2ME8sR-bnY) that  it doesn't matter *why* they choose to have an abortion. Its their right to choose, after all. So, how do you tackle the concept of motive and intent when it comes to abortion? Is sex-selective abortion just something society is going to have to life with?

I'm level 30, finally got my hands on a few good enchanted weapons. Except i can't refill them. I've looked on google, the Elders Scrolls Wiki, everywhere, and i can't find any answers.I think i'm doing everything right. I go to my inventory, my weapons, hit "T" to recharge when i'm on the weapon i need recharged. A little list comes up of my soul gems (all of which are full). I click on one and...nothing. The soul gem window closes like it did something, but it didn't. There's no sound cue either. It doesn't matter if i click on the soul gem or hit enter, but nothing happens.I don't know if this is a problem with the mod or what, but its pretty much a game ending glitch. Without enchanted weapons, i'm screwed. I hope someone out there can tell me how to fix this glitch.

1j3t8h	-30405	1374856700	psychology	Writer hoping to accurately portray trauma and treatment.	I'm a writer, currently trying to write a character with certain mental disorders and condition, mainly depression, and i'm trying to write this character as accurately as possible. If you can, i'd like to ask a few questions. If there's a better place to ask these questions, please tell me, and i'll go there.The character, named Casey, is a fifteen year old girl. When she was eight years old, while home alone with her cousin, she came across her uncle's pistol. Thinking it was a toy, she pointed the gun at her cousin and pulled the trigger, killing him.The story is loosely based on my great uncle, who did the same thing. He died at sixteen (Drowned, but by all accounts it didn't appear to be suicide), long before i was born, so i can't exactly ask him and my grandmother doesn't really remember what he was like so i can't ask her.I understand that people deal with trauma in different ways, so i'm not going to ask something as general as "What would Casey be like?". These are the questions i would like answered.If Casey attempted to kill herself and constantly dealt with thoughts of suicide and other symptoms of depression (And these thoughts often related back to the shooting), what would a psychiatrist call her disorder? My research points to something like PTSD or Traumatic Grief, but i fully admit that I have absolutely no clue what i'm talking about. If i did, i wouldn't need to be here.How would a psychiatrist treat her? Talk therapy, medicine? Some combination of the two? Or maybe something else entirely? If talk therapy, exactly what would they talk about? How would the doctor steer the conversation, and to what end?Is there any other general information I should keep in mind when considering a teenage girl dealing with these kinds of emotions? For example, I know that men and women have different tenancies when it comes to suicide. As i understand it, women tend to prefer pills; Casey tried to OD via sleeping pills. If there's anything off the top of your head when it comes to adolescent women dealing with trauma, i'd like to know it.Anyway, i really appreciate any and all responses. Like i said before, if this isn't the place to ask, i'll go somewhere else. If my questions need to be more specific or i need to give more background, Just say so and i'll do it.

It got me thinking; How common was it to come across someone of a completely different ethnic/racial mold as you in the Ancient and Medieval time? a Chinese person in Rome and vice-versa, a Black African in Scotland, and so on. And how would these people be perceived? Would a citizen of London circa 200 BC  see a black person and know they were from Africa? Or would they just be completely baffled? I imagine in big empires it would've been relatively common, but what about smaller kingdoms?
1k2ii6	-30405	1376104226	AskReddit	Reddit, how do you deal with people who don't treat you with the respect you feel you deserve?	I hope the question is clear, but if it isn't, I'll give an example; the situation that got me curious. I live with my family, my parents and my older sister. A few hours ago, she snapped her fingers at me and ordered me to take out the trash. Now, i'm an adult, and even when i was a little kid, i never minded housework. But i don't like being treated like a subordinate by people who don't have power over me. If my parents, my boss, or my other coworkers with seniority tell me to do something, I do it, probably while saying "Yes sir/ma'am". that's one thing. I think its reasonable to assume I am my sisters equal.So, I told her I didn't appreciate being treated like that, and I asked her to *ask* me from now on. While i was talking, she pulled out her phone to answer a text. She didn't respond, at first i thought she didn't hear me, so i asked her if she understood.She snapped, said "I don't have to understand. Just take out the fucking trash." When i said that i was under no obligation to do so, she said "I'll just tell mom and dad to make you do it." Because she's the kind of person who thinks *everyone* is beneath her, even her parents. When they got home, we all had a chat. My sister was absolutely *shocked* to see that my parents took my side. She began shouting, cursing, and so on. I've used this method in the past. People usually respond pretty well when you just state the problem and ask nicely. It didn't work this time, though. So, I'm curious about how others handle these kinds of situations. Do you talk the person? If you do, what do you say? Or do you do something else entirely?

1kj53o	-30405	1376710251	Health	Phantom smell and odd memories	Not sure if this is the right place to post. I searched for an "ask doctors" thread, but couldn't find one. I don't exactly know how to describe this, but every now and then, off and on for years, I'll smell this weird smell. Its so damn familiar to me, and yet, i can't place it. It isn't a pleasant one, either, it reminds me of sweaty balls and chlorine. Sometimes i'll smell it for a few seconds before it just kind of goes away, but sometimes it lasts for hours or more (Not continously; at time of writing, for example, I smell the smell every other minute or so. Oddly, it happens even when i make it a point to breath with my mouth, only then its more of a taste)Even weirder is that its often accompanied by vivid memories. Sometimes, and i know this sounds weird, but several, unrelated memories at once, which gets very confusing. Its not like i'm reliving them or anything like that, its just that they come back to me. The sensation is like remembering where you put your keys after looking for them for an hour. I've looked it up on the internet, and I'm a little scared, because most people say its a symptom of a tumor. But i've had MRI's before (i think the last one was about a year ago) with and without contrast on my head. If a tumor was there, i'd wager the doctors would see it. What else could it be and should i be worried?

It will eat your free time). It's mainly used by Crossbowmen in the game, and I'm *almost* 100% certain that it isn't a made up thing and that it has a real name. But, for some reason, the game just calls it a "Spiked Staff"The picture is kind of small but its the only one I could find. Basically its a short wooden staff with a spike at the end, and its design seems to be made for stabbing, particularly through armor. I want to say It was commonly used by Arbalest's in real life, as a kind of backup weapon for when enemies got in range. Like i said, i'm almost 100% sure this weapon has a name. I feel like I knew it at one point, and its right on the tip of my tongue, but for some reason, I'm drawing a blank. I know its fairly mundane question, but I hope you'll answer. I'd appreciate it.  Edit: Thanks you guys. its called a Goedendag. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goedendag

1mu4t4	-30405	1379770695	FanTheories	The Rambo Sequels are dying dreams.	There was a recent AskReddit Thread about Fan Theories, which is where I originally posted this. I was surprised that nobody had heard the theory before, and I didn't find it in a search on this Subreddit, so, maybe I can partake in some delicious Karma. None of the Rambo sequels actually happened. [There's a blink-and-you-miss it scene in Rambo] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTZLa_HjLS4) (the most recent, and likely final, movie) where Rambo sees a bunch of images from his past. One of the images is of this [deleted scene] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp1mdSQ4BfI), where Trautman kills Rambo. It was too depressing, especially since it followed up the famous scene where Rambo breaks down and cries while speaking of past trauma, so it was cut and replaced with Rambo being arrested, which opened up the movie for sequels later on.  Yet even though this scene, for all intents and purposes, *never happened* in the continuity of the movies, Rambo still remembers it. Why?Because that's what actually happened. Trautman killed Rambo. He's lying on the floor of that police station, dying, and the sequels are just his dying dream. Everything represents things in his past, and his mind is just trying to tie up emotional loose ends. The second movie is about his experienced in Veitnam. He goes back and saves a few soldiers from POW camps; metaphorically, he's saving himself and his friends who died. At the end, he gets to take out his frustration for "not being allowed to win." on some asshole government lackie (And has anyone else noticed how much Murdock looks like Sheriff Will Teasle? I know they're different actors, but I've always seen a resemblance.) In Part 3, He gets to square his issues with Trautman, whom he resents for being "normal" after the war. Metaphorically, It was to square his issues with Trautman (whom he saved) as well as get back at the Russians, who he would've seen as the real enemy and the ultimate cause of Veitnam (Right, wrong, or indifferent, that's what someone in his position would believe). You might be able to tie into his childhood; remember the scene with the horses? Well, he grew up on a farm (that's how he knew how to ride), so there could be some kind of connection there. Also, he interacts with a few kids. In fact, the entire movie could be seen as him working through issues he sustained not in the war, but pre-war, in his childhood. Can't imagine someone like him had a nice one.  It's also easy to make the connection that Trautman is his father; not in a biological sense, but in an emotional one. In Rambo, he finally resolves all his violent issues and finds his way back home. He walks onto that farm, and he finally dies. The pacifists could hark back to this exchange at the end of First Blood**Rambo**: Nothing is over! Nothing! You just don't turn it off! It wasn't my war! You asked me, I didn't ask you! And I did what I had to do to win, but somebody wouldn't let us win! And I come back to the world, and I see all those maggots at the airport, protesting me, spitting; throwing stuff and calling me a baby killer and all kinds of vile crap. Who are they to protest me for, huh?! Who are they?! Unless they've been me and been there, and know what the hell they're yelling about?!It's safe to say at the end of the movie, those pacifists had been there and been him. They won't be spitting on any vets any time soon.also, here's the Video of the flashback in Rambo: If you watch the dream clip in context of the sequels being his dying dream, the dialogue practically confirms it. I honestly don't think there's another way to interpret that scene. In a way, its all very poetic. Rambo never really left 'Nam, and he never leaves that police station.

1o6pkf	-30405	1381451698	japan	Questions about Youkai and Japanese Folklore.	Hi there, r/Japan. I'd be really glad if you helped me out. I'm an aspiring writer, currently writing a series of Supernatural themed novels, with vampires, werewolves, magic and such. One of the stories has them travel to Shanghai (I am aware that this is in China. However, I'm portraying the supernatural world as very "Global", and Shanghai is sort of the capital of the Supernatural world in Asia). One of the character is a Spider-Youkai.First, I've read the Wiki page on Jorōgumo and Tsuchigumo. I'd like to know of any stories you may have heard about them. Like weaknesses, how they interact with other Youkai, things like that. Are their any famous Spider-Youkai in Japanese Folklore? If so, who are they, and why are they famous?Also, I'd like to verify something: Hengeyoukai are Youkai that can take human form, right? That's what my (admittedly little) research has told me. What are some Youkai that can't take human form, or are at least not usually presented as being capable of taking human form?I did post this earlier, but I asked about translations too, so I think it was taken off the subreddit somehow and told me to ask in r/Translator.  Any and all (accurate) information will be very helpful. I thank you very much for your time.

1o7jii	-30405	1381483571	asktransgender	If a man had his genitalia forcibly removed, could he then become female through Reassignment?	Thankfully, I'm not asking for myself. Some friends of mine were killing time between shifts the other day. Someone said something about a man in the local area who killed himself after an industrial accident burned his genitalia so bad they had to be removed. his wife of ten years left him only weeks after. All suicide is tragic, but i definitely sympathize. We stated talking about how (or really, if) we could cope with the loss of our penis and/or testicles. One of us said that they would get reassignment surgery, which actually seems reasonable. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to find love with a woman when you're not "Complete" so to speak. While being a post-op Lesbian may come with its own problems, you would at least be able to find sexual companionship and, if your lucky, love.But that also got me thinking. I'm not entirely sure how MTF Sexaul reassignment works. Would having your genitals removed make it impossible? Would the vagina you get be "functional" (as in, capable of orgasm). I'm reasonably sure that the burns the local man received would complicate things, but what if they were cut off? **Note: I'm *not* saying that having a penis makes you a man, and not having a penis makes you any less of a man, I'm saying that a cisgendered man without genitalia would likely never feel whole again, and would likely not be seen as such by most women**  Edit: I'm getting a few downvotes. I think I understand why. I'm not trying to downplay how terrible the gender dysphoria is, I'm weighing the discomfort one would feel with Gender Dysphoria against the man who was forcibly turned into a Eunuch. Both are terrible, and the situation sucks, but the option with Gender Dysphoria, at least one has romantic and sexual prospects. Edit2: I realize now that, even if it is possible, it may not be the best course of action for a man in this situation.   I'm sorry If i came off as condescending or sexist.

The plot has a few guys crash land in the Yukon and have to survive the cold, ice, and a pack of wolves out for blood.Well, My cousin said that the one Black guy in the group would be at a severe disadvantage compared to his white comrades. He stated that, because Black people are tailor made to survive in Jungle/Desert environments, putting one in a high altitude cold environment meant he was out of his element, and that he would likely have problems getting oxygen thanks to the altitude.   Is this true? Because it kind of seems like it could be; after all, we wouldn't have different skin tones if it didn't confer some kind of evolutionary advantage. Black people *are* suited towards environments that get a lot of sunlight. That being said, if it isn't true, it sounds really, really racist, so I'd like to know now before I go throwing this little fact out in polite society.

I know how weird an obscure this sounds, but I'm 100% sure I read it somewhere. I think it was Richard Feynman, and I think it was the number 137. Does anyone know what I'm talking about? If I'm wrong, please correct me. If I'm right, I'd like to have a source of some kind. Thank you for any and all responses.

26ckeu	-30405	1400898650	actuallesbians	I'm a writer, and sexuality is a central part of one of my main characters. I was hoping to get help with some terms.	I'm a writer, currently writing a series with the working title "Strange World". I won't go deep into it, but its an Urban Fantasy/Adventure/Horror. The main character is a girl named Casey. When I first started writing the story, Casey was actually a guy, but I changed the characters gender when I realized I wanted a stronger female presence. Casey is fifteen years old, and very much a tom boy. She's extremely athletic and sporty. Before high school, she played football, but the high school team wont let a girl play. Thankfully, the Baseball team is Co-ed, and she's a decent outfielder and has more than a few good hits under her belt. She also runs track and does very well.Casey doesn't have a boyfriend, in fact, she's never had a boyfriend. She's only fifteen, and her life is hectic for other reasons, so she's never really wanted one. At the start of the first story, her best friend of all time asks her out on a date. She's attracted to him, and she accepts. If this was a different story, their date would've been fine. But unfortunately, this story is heavily influenced by Lovecraft. Her date ends up seeing something so horrific that he becomes hysterically blind, another friend dies, and Casey gets pulled into the supernatural world. Throughout the stories, many people suggest interest in Casey romantically. both men and women, and Casey has trouble understanding whether or not she's attracted to them back, but she does eventually realize she's attracted to both men and women. Casey is very androgynous. She has a cute face, dirty blond hair, and a very slender, athletic build. Sadly, she's lacking in the breast department, though that doesn't bother her, as she's pretty confident in her looks. She's mistaken for a (cute) boy by a few people, and many men and women come onto her.  She realizes pretty early on that's attracted to another woman, but she isn't quite sure how she should handle the relationship.My first question: Is there a special name for someone like Casey? An attractive, Androgynous bisexual? I wouldn't call her a Butch Lesbian, would I? That doesn't seem right. I guess she is butch in comparison to certain, more feminine women, but objectively, she's not butch. She has "feminine" interests, but they take a back seat to more masculine ones. Also, I don't know if Butch Lesbianism includes mentality, but Casey doesn't instigate relationships. She's still a kid and gets very nervous when romance and sex is brought up, especially if she's talking  to someone she's attractive. I see her as being a lot more Submissisve than I think Butches are. That being said, I know little about Lesbian subculture.My other question is: Are there any sterotypes that Lesbians/Bisexuals hate seeing in Media? For example, a Lesbian being "Turned" by the male hero. That won't happen in this story, because I make it clear from very early on that Casey is attracted to both genders equally. Nobody's going to "turn" her.  I want to write a character that everyone, regardless of their sexuality, can find relatable, but given that she's an LGBT character, I want feedback from LGBT individuals on what to do and what not to do. Thanks. Any feedback is much appreciative.      Edit: So I made this post when I was high and drunk. Not entirely sure why. I chose many a words improperly and basically talked about all the sterotypes I was going to write. The romance arc in this story is about 1% of the story in general. I *think* was coming here looking for specific terms, I don't know. But this isn't a "Queer" romance story, or even a romance story at all. the story is based mostly around political power vacuum and the politics of a Supernatural World. Kind of like the World Of Darkness if any of you are into RolePlay.  Sort of like a Harry Potter meets Burn Notice. I'm sorry Drunk&amp;High me had to come around and talk about all the cliches he was going to put into the story. Please just disregard most of this. Its stupid, and I'm stupid, and you all were very nice to someone who was very stupid.

26vy8j	-30405	1401468622	skyrimrequiem	Random Light Armor skill level	I'm playing as a mage, no armor, using mostly spells but occasionally a sword for defense/offense, and for some reason every so often my light armor skill increases. I'm not wearing *any* armor, light or otherwise. At first I thought the game tagged "Mage Armor" as light armor, but it happens even when I'm not armored up. I don't necessarily *mind* this glitch, if it is a glitch, but i'm afraid it might be interfering with the mage armor perk that increases how many armor points you get when you aren't wearing any armor. For the record, no, I am *not* wearing any light armor. Or heavy armor, for that matter. I think it might actually be counting *jewelry* as armor but I'm honestly not sure. Has anyone encountered this before?
26wpf3	-30405	1401485123	skyrim	The Truth about Olaf One-Eye	In the Bard's College Questline, we learn about Olaf One-Eye, a former king of Skyrim who seems to be either loved or hated depending on where you are. At the end of the Questline, you get a book about him, but its unfinished, and the player literally gets to decide what happened in the missing pages. No matter your choices, Olaf is either a liar, a coward, or possibly a Dragon in human form. My question is this: Is there anything, in the game, or the game guides, or maybe a dev said something, that sheds light on the truth? Are any of the players dialogue choices *true* (albeit accidentally). Is there anything, anywhere, that hints at the content of those missing pages? The only one we can safely rule out, I think, is that he was not a dragon in human form. Beyond that, either of the players suggestions could be true, or they could be hilariously inaccurate. 
26yrjz	-30405	1401553967	skyrim	Sword, Mace, or Ax?	This is something that bothers me in Fantasy games. I always, *always*, use a sword, and I feel like most games encourage this decision. This is mainly because the best weapons in the game tend to be swords. For example, Dawnbreaker is is probably the most useful weapon in the game considering how much undead you fight, and there's a dragon-slaying sword you find in the old Blades hideout. Hell, even the name *blades* implies swords. I wouldn't expect to encounter a Blade agent who toted a mace.I don't know, I feel like weapons like Axes and Maces are for poor folk who can't afford swords (Kind of like real life, where only Nobility could afford swords; average joe soldier had to make due with an  Ax, mace, or more likely, a spear. My preference to swords actually detracts from some quests. Okay, Mr. Molag Bal, I'm sure that mace is cool and all, but its big, its slow and I legitimately want nothing to do with it. I'm curious if anyone else shares this feeling, like there's no reason to carry anything other than a sword. I understand that some people prefer Bows, but that's a tad different, considering how they're used in different contexts.  If you do carry something other than a sword, I'd be interested in hearing a reason why.

Basically, it allows me to tell Molag Ball to go fuck himself. He curses me with a 50% weakness to fire, but to get rid of it, and a new, divine-inspired perk, all I have to do is pray at a shrine of Stendarr.Problem is, when I *do* go to a shrine of Stendarr, it doesn't work. It registers that I've gotten the blessing (it says "I feel better already") but the curse doesn't go away. I was wondering if anyone knew how to fix this. If all else fails I can leave the quest uncompleted, or complete the quest and throw the Mace at the bottom of the Lake, but I really like this quest mod as it helps me roll play. If someone else has encountered the bug and knows how to fix it, I'd really like to know. Thanks. Edit: I *Think* it has something to do with the fact that I went over the crime limit and the divines pitched a fit. I got the "Painful Regrets" perk, and I can get divine blessings normally, so I don't know what the problem is.

274rzl	-30405	1401734400	TheLastAirbender	If you were in charge of making an Avatar movie, what would it be about, and what changes would you make?	In a recent post, I made a [comment] (http://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/271cms/waterbending_from_the_movie/chwpg3r) about how I would've changed the bending in a Live Action movie to make it more cinematic. Basically, it boils down to this: We all know about M. Night's infamous Tai Chi battles, where it takes a good two minutes of movements for bending to work, and the results are...extremely disproportionate to the effort put in. In my movie, I would've actually *kept* those long, slow Kata movements, but the bending would've been *extremely* powerful. Two minutes movements followed by *elemental mayhem*. In this case, the bending isn't a natural extension of martial arts, but more like a sorcerer making mystical motions to invoke a spell. Its different from the show, I realize that, but the bending in the show only works because animation has no limits. Reality does.As I said in my comment, it would bring a new element (no pun intended) into battles. You see a Bender doing his wind up? Either run or make sure he is dead (or otherwise interrupted) before he finishes, because if he *does* finish, he's going to unleash absolute destruction on you. The Bending takes longer, but is more powerful; imagine what the Avatar is capable of while in the Avatar state, or what Fire Benders were capable of during the comet. If a Fire Bender successfully attacks, he's going to wreck infrastructure, infantry lines, entire ships, etc. individual (or small teams) of Water Benders easily capsizing huge ships. Earth Benders creating massive walls in mere moments or creating huge crevasses or canyons to put a stop to infantry/cavalry charges. The benders would need non-bending soldiers to protect them while they did their wind ups, and anyone with a bow/crossbow and a lucky shot could take them out. So while the actual *bending* is more powerful, the individual benders are more vulnerable. These kind of slow movements would be so much easier to film, and it would add a lot of tension in battle scenes. You have two armies each trying to protect its own benders while trying to incapacitate the other. You'd save on special effects because not every Bender would really get a chance to bend. Of course, when they *did* succeed you'd need some epic special effects to drive home just how dangerous and powerful bending is. Beyond the bending, I would change the setting and time period to the early days of the war, revolving around the Fire Nation invasion/occupation of the Patola Mountains (as seen [here] (http://images2.fanpop.com/image/photos/10900000/Avatar-World-Map-avatar-the-last-airbender-10941960-1659-1416.jpg) in a map (Between the Fire Nation and the Southern Water Tribe) and [here] (http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Patola_Mountains) at the wiki). Sozin's comet has passed but the Fire Nation has to hunt down remaining Air Benders. I don't think the Air Nomads really *governed* territory, being spiritual nomads, so I would wager the mountain ranges were fairly independent, and, given the naturally difficult terrain, hard to conquer. Given how close the mountains are to the other three nations, I'm betting there were Benders of every stripe living there, so the resistance to the Fire Nation occupation could be made up of Earth, Water, and even Fire Benders, to say nothing of the Air Bender remnants. This would also finally answer the question of how the Fire Nation actually *got* to the Southern Air Temple. Aang believes its only accessible via Air Bison, and the Fire Nation didn't yet have flying technology. A running theory is that they used dragons, but I wouldn't be surprised if the Fire Nation stole, bought, or otherwise obtained Air Bison. It would be pretty cool to see the soldiers using Air Bison as troop transports. But if they did use Air Bison, we could see dog fights between Air Bison VS Dragons, and that would be so metal.As for the story itself, my story would be about a Water Bending healer and pilgrim from the Southern Water Tribe, hoping to travel the world and help whoever she can when the comet passes and the whole world goes to hell. She, some rebels from the surrounding areas, and a youngish Guru Pathik try to shelter some Air Bender children and fight off the occupation. A general with a host of Fire Nation soldiers and a sizable navy is tasked pacifying the area and hunting down any Air Nomads left. The mountains themselves would be strategically important to the Fire Nations overal strategy, as it would give them a staging ground to launch raids against the Southern Water Tribe, who are (presumably) at this point in history, pretty powerful, with plenty of cities, soldiers and ships. Given there's no indication the mountain range is inhabited by the time ATLA starts, and all the Air Nomads are dead, the ending wouldn't exactly be happy, but I feel the story could be pretty kickass none the less.As a side note, Pathik himself could be a local to the Patola mountain ranges, explaining why he's racially different from pretty much everyone else we see. Since, in my version anyway, the mountains are something of a hub between the Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation and Southern Water Tribe, (As well as hosting a temple of Air Nomads), you could be a lot more flexible when it comes to race and ethnicity during casting. That isn't to say you could cast anyone as anyone from any nation, but if your character is a local to the mountain ranges you have some leeway. If the character was *explicitly* from a different nation, they should be of an identifiable ethnicity (as in, people should be able to look at them and go "Yep, you are from X nation"). I think it would be interesting to see a homogeneous army invading a racially diverse place, but that's just me.   So, there's my idea, how about yours? What would your movie be about? What changes would you make?     Edit: Formatting

27bc3w	-30405	1401908539	skyrim	Pro-Empire Thieves Guild, Anti-Empire Dark Brotherhood.	I don't know if anyone has noticed, but the Thieves Guild questline is kind of Pro-Empire. If the Empire takes Riften, Maven becomes Jarl, which I imagine would help the thieves guild *immensely*. Your contact in Whiterun is Olfrid Battle-Born, the patriarch of an influential Pro-Empire family (If the conversation Idolaf has with Adrianne is any indication, the Battle-Born family may well be bankrolling the local legion, or at least buying *some* of its equipment). There's also the implication that the thieves guild is heavily invested in the success of the East Empire Trading company, a company which is backed by the Emperor himself.And in the Dark Brotherhood you...uh, well, you kill the goddamned Emperor, as well as working directly against the Penitus Oculatus. You also kill Vittoria Vici, who I guess is royalty and is also some kind of big-league in the East Empire Trading company. Hell, one of the quests is *literally* called "To Kill an Empire". To say that the Dark Brotherhood has an anti-Empire bias is putting it lightly. By itself, that doesn't bother me (Although I do feel weird if I try to roleplay as a Pro-Empire Assassin or Pro-Stormcloak Thief), but the fact is that the Dark Brotherhood and the Thieves Guild seem to have a very good relationship. If you join one, the game seems to want you to join the other. Which would be awesome if it made any sense; I mean, how cool would it be to basically be the kingpin of crime in Skyrim by running both the Dark Brotherhood *and* the Thieves Guild. but these organizations should be at each others throats, as they seem to have very contradictory interests. There really should be a script of Maven or Astrid telling you to fuck off if you joined the other organization. Has anyone else noticed this? Does it bug anyone else or am I reading too much into it? 
27dk5z	-30405	1401970843	TheLastAirbender	Questions about the political systems in the world of Avatar.	I have a few questions about the governments in the world of avatar, mainly about the Air Nomads and the Earth Kingdom. Its said that the Air Nomads had no military; that makes sense, for a few reasons. One, they're pacifists. Two, most of their temples seem to be within other countries; so having your own military *inside* another nation would be awkward for all involved. We also see the governing body of the Air Nomads; a council of Four, one from each temple (Since temples were gender-divided, this meant it had two women and two men). Do we know anything about the governance of the Air Nomads beyond that? For example, how are the council representatives chosen? I have to assume they aren't born into it since children seem to be raised communally. Were they elected? Did they have campaigns? They seemed to be on relatively good terms with the other nations, given that the Air Nomads seemed to have free reign to enter and exit as they pleased; did the Air Nomads have any kind of official embassies in the other nations?  What did the governing body actually *do*? We know they had no military, but did they have a police force or any kind of justice system? If not, how did they handle crime? I'm not buying the idea that no Air Nomad ever committed a crime, so don't try to sell it to me. Did they print and regulate money? If so, did they collect taxes? What were the taxes spent on? I wouldn't be surprised if all money was used communally; essentially some kind of theocratic proto-communists.Did all Air Nomads live the same way? Were they all just traveling monks? I mean, did they have varying jobs (builders, smiths, farmers, merchants, ect). Also, what is the deal with the Earth Kingdom? The Earth Kingdom is a *massive* place, probably about the size of two Fire Nations; and it has *at least* two Kings. Are the Kingdom of Omashu and the Kingdom of Ba Sing Sei (and other cities) different governments? Are they Greek-styled city-states, who are differing governing bodies but have similar interests? For example, Kyoshi Island seems to be part of the Earth Kingdom, but they seem to be largely independent. Do they pay taxes to Ba Sing Sei or another city? Also, Chin The Conqueror seemed to be conquering the entire continent (I don't know whether or not he was warring with the other three nations, but I know for a fact he was ravaging the Earth Kingdom). He couldn't do that unless the continent wasn't united. If the Earth Kingdom wasn't a united government during ATLA, has it changed into one by the time of Korra? If they aren't united, how exactly does that work when it comes to representation on the council? The Earth Kingdom has *one* Representative, but if the Earth Kingdom isn't a united government, who he/she actually represent?And my last question. The Water Tribes seemed to be ruled by Chiefs, which seemed to be a hereditary position, making them Kings in all but name. Hakoda was called "Chief". Does that mean that Sokka and Katara are royalty? Granted, they're royalty of a small village and maybe some other small villages, but I imagine they still have some kind of legal power; the power to tax, raise armies, pass judgement, print money, etc.

27uccu	-30405	1402452909	gameofthrones	[Show Spoilers] How much, if any, sympathy do you have for the Wildlings? Why do you feel that way?	I've seen people defending the Wildlings in this subreddit a lot, and I honestly don't understand why. I admit I was pretty much rooting for them at first, because they're basically forced to live in an inhospitable and dangerous land because they're ancestors were in the wrong place at the wrong time. One of the reasons I didn't like Jon Snow at first is because I felt like the Nights Watch was completely unsympathetic. It would be one thing if the Nights Watch just monitored The Wall and the immediate area around it, but they actually go hunting for Wildlings in their own home, which has made them extremely belligerent towards the NW and the Seven Kingdoms in general. If they hadn't done that, and allowed for free movement between North and South of the Wall, they wouldn't be facing the problems they have today. In fact, they wouldn't have an Army of 100,000 Wildlings bearing down on them to escape the White Walker invasion, they'd have an Army of 100,000 Wildlings as allies in fighting the encroaching WW Invasion.But that was in season 1 and 2. Come 3 and 4, I lost all of my sympathy for the Wildlings. With exactly one exception, Gilly (I guess technically her baby counts too, but I'm not counting people who haven't had anything to do or say yet), every single Wildling we've met as been a violent, amoral, psychopath. Yes, If I was in their shoes I'd want to leave too, and I understand that violence is pretty much the only option for them at this point, but that does not give them free reign to attack and murder innocent, unarmed people who have nothing to do with the conflict. Ygritte and Tormund started out as cool characters who didn't seem like bad people at all, but the moment they got South of the Wall they showed their true colors. Jon Snow is branded a traitor because he wouldn't murder a helpless, unarmed, innocent non-combatant. (Yes, he is a traitor, but not because of that). It would be one thing if they just attacked the stables, burned them down, stole the horses they could use and killed the ones they didn't. But it didn't even seem like they wanted to do that, they just wanted to fucking murder a "southerner". Tormunds plan is sound, he wants to draw the NW out, but that plan would be accomplished all the same (not to mention, quicker) if he let the man live so he could return to the Nights Watch and tell them what happened. In Season 4, they hook up with the Thenns, psychotic cannibals, to go raiding the towns and hamlets in the North around the Wall. We're only shown two on screen; Moles Town and Olly's village, but Sam mentions that "We know they've been raiding villages." I'm not entirely sure if we see Tormund take part in the massacres, but I think its safe to assume he did. I guess we can't technically know for sure if Mance Rayder ordered these massacres, but I don't see any reason to assume he would be against it, and that makes him just as guilty. And Before anyone says it, Ygritte decided to spare Gilly and Sam (the baby) doesn't somehow make everything okay. Yes, she chose to spare those two. How many mothers and sons did she decide not to spare?Then you have Craster. An incestuous rapist who rapes women so they give birth to more women he can rape, and so on. If that weren't bad enough, he gives his sons to the White Walkers. Its possible he doesn't know what that really means for the children, but its still pretty reprehensible. The women of Crasters Keep get a little more sympathy from me, but when a son is birthed to them, they encourage the NW Deserters to continue Craster's policy of giving them to the White Walkers. Maybe they did this to save the baby from immediate death, and maybe they don't necessarily know what the sacrifice really does, its hard to tell. In the end, the women, in all of their appearances except for their final one, have exactly zero agency and no choice in the matter, so I can't really add them to the good or evil side of the spectrum any more than I can add any unnamed Wildling extras.Last, we have Osha and her raiding party. While Osha is a fairly decent person now, that's really only because she gained some empathy with the Starks. Before that, she and the rest of her party were totally 100% okay with hurting an innocent little boy. Gods only know what they would've done had they survived the encounter with Theon and Rob.If season 3 and 4 has made me understand anything, its why the Wall has to be defended against the Wildlings. At first, I wondered why they didn't just let the Wildlings through so they could focus on the White Walkers, but now I understand. If Mance's host gets through, the Seven Kingdoms, already weak from the War, is going to be destroyed by a massive host of raiders, rapists, murderers and fucking cannibals, who will cut through them until they're dead, or as "Far South as South Goes". Basically what Khal Drogo was planning before he got Martin'd, but arguably worse, as the planned Dothraki invasion had a goal, at least: to put Dany on the throne. The Wildling invasion would be nothing but pure, senseless chaos.But, I understand this show has a lot of grey, and I'd like to know if people feel differently, and why.Also, not sure if I used the right bracket thing at the beginning, but I figured since we're discussing that's that have happened, its spoilers.

So, major spoilers, if you have watched season finale of season 4, don't keep reading. Tyrion kills Tywin, but before he does so, they have a chat. Tywin says several times "You're my son." and that he wouldn't let anyone kill him, and saying generally un-Tywin things before he says the wrong word and gets himself shot, at which point he does a 180 and curses him. Given that, earlier that day, Tywin found out the truth about the two children he actually respected (That Jamie and Cersei were banging and Tommen is Jamie's son), I think its entirely possible for Tywin to have looked at his son in a different light, and maybe realized he'd done wrong by him.But, given how intelligent he is, it wouldn't surprise me if Tywin was just saying whatever he thought would save him.

When Bolin and Varrick run into a bunch of water and fire benders fleeing  from a concentration camp?Now, don't get me wrong, i'm not questioning that these camps might exist or that they'd run into them. But they state that Kuvira put water and fire benders into prison for not being "Earth Kingdom/Empire" enough; something about them being foreigners. Uh, bullshit? The Swamp Benders of the Foggy swamp have been living in the earth kingdom for generations. Yes, they are water benders, but who cares? All that means is that Kuvira has a bunch of Water Benders, some of which *can heal wounds* to add to her army. Also, considering the 100 year long occupation, their probably is a healthy minority of fire benders who have lived in Earth Kingdom/Empire territory for a few generations. Fire Benders  who can *power your machines*. Also, we saw last season that the Zaofu police force has a few non-earth benders in it. Hell, some of them probably joined Kuvira when she left. I just don't buy that someone like Kuvira would throw away such potential like that. It seems like the writers are just trying to play her like Hitler to get us to hate her.

2ujtvz	-30405	1422906723	nosleep	Baboon Lane	In the United States of America, in the state of Ohio, about forty-five minutes North West of Cincinnati, there is a large, but sparsely populated farming community known as Oregonia. Some of you who have an interest in Motorcycles may have heard of it before, as the community is famous for its hills and holds the annual “Devil's Staircase Hill Climb”, where motorcyclists ride their bikes up a very steep hill. It's a lot more fun than it sounds, and it brings in a lot of money and excitement to what is normally a very boring area.Oregonia is actually a pretty interesting place for being so small and secluded. The guy who invented pop tabs, the thing on top of soda cans that open them, lived there. He was an industrialist by the name of Ralph J. Stolle. There were also a few interesting experiments held at the farm; it was one of the first to try and breed “beefalo”, Cattle/Buffalo hybrids that were supposed to be healthier, reproduce faster, stuff like that. This story is about a similar experiment.If any of you pass through Oregonia, you can confirm this story with the locals, but you'll have to the press them somewhat. The older folks won't talk about it, but people between fifteen and thirty will have a story or two. Ask them about the unmarked, unnamed, gated off road above Turtle Creek Cemetery. Ask them about the facility at the end of that road, and what it used to be used for. Ask them about Baboon Lane.Mostly, you'll hear the official story. The facility at the end of baboon lane was a research lab that specialized in studying the effects of various diseases on Baboons, who are closely related to humans, and so the research is viable. Another story says that Stolle had to do something with his money, so he bought a bunch of animals but couldn't properly care for them, and just locked them in there. The younger kids will tell you different local legends; my favorite is that it's a storage facility for some kind of government black ops organization storing something like the Arc of the Covenant or something. The occasional ghost haunting story is to be expected, so are aliens and such. It is a farm, after all, and I'm sure I believed one of those stories at one point. But on a rare, rare occasion, someone will know, and be willing to part with, the truth. And when they do, you'll understand why its so rare.My story starts as many of my childhood stories start: I was wondering through the woods, although unlike most of my stories, I wasn't alone. My cousins were over at my grandparents' home. At the time, Oregonia had little to no internet or Cable. We actually had to play outside back then. There were six of us. My cousins Matt, Shane, Ethan, Tory, and Monique, and me. I was the youngest, only eight when this happened, But my older cousins usually treated me well and made me a part of everything, if not only because I lived there with my parents just up the road from my grandparents house. I knew all the trails, the hills, the valleys, the places to play. Without me, they would get lost, and they did pretty often if they didn't take me or got separated.When we were all there together, we would usually grab a bunch of toy guns and play soldiers; even the girls, because there wasn't much else to do. Sometimes we'd grab sticks and fight, and sometimes we'd play tag, or hide and seek in the woods, but I always won, so we didn't play that often. This story was soldiers. We were all dropped into Normandy to fight Nazis.D-Day was in the morning, just after we ate breakfast. By the time noon rolled around, we were in Vietnam, and after dinner, when the sun was setting, we were out of wars to fight. The oldest of us, Matt, looked to me and asked,“Is there anything else we can do?”I thought about it, and replied. When I remember this story, this is the part where I wince, like watching that part in a movie where a character makes a stupid decision that gets someone killed. I didn't get hurt, but there are things you just don't want to know, and the deal with Baboon lane was one of them.“We could check out Baboon Lane.” I said. They seemed interested. I don't remember exactly when I heard about it, but I remember holding onto the knowledge until asked, because I wanted to impress them. I told them the local legends, and with the sun setting, we all agreed it'd be cool to explore. None of us wanted to admit we were scared, me least of all, being the youngest and the most to prove.If they are told of Baboon lane, every child is told not to go near it. I was given the same warning, but my cousins weren't. I wasn't afraid of getting in trouble, as we always went places we weren't supposed to go. Abandoned warehouses, caves, construction sites, and so on, and nothing bad ever happened.We finally got there just as it got dark. We didn't have to be home for another two hours or so, so we had time. We checked the area for security guards or cameras, but didn't find any. The door was locked, but a window was broken out, so we just snuck in.There were a few buildings. The smaller buildings were just offices and storage, but the biggest one is what this story is about. It was a big, long building, separated into portions. Inside the first portion of the building was just a normal office. It was like a reception area and some desks. We didn't stay there long, as there was a big sliding door opposite the front door. We went through.It was the size of a warehouse (in fact, I think they may have cleaned it out and use it for storage nowadays). The right wall was lined with cages. We looked at those first. Each cage was about five feet tall, two wide, and maybe two deep. Matt tried to get in; he was fourteen, and too tall for it, having to bend his head slightly. There wasn't enough room for him to sit, either.The left wall had a lot of equipment on it. Big machines that you see in old black and white pictures of military instillation. Beakers, test tubes, big industrial sinks, and other lab equipment. There was a second floor. We poked around, and didn't find anything.In the next section were offices, but more like work offices rather than some kind of reception. The next was a kind of loading dock and warehouse. We poked around the work offices, breaking into desks. Whoever worked there had cleaned out in a hurry, as most of the contents of the desks were still there. That's when we found it.It was in the biggest office, on the second story; it had a window overlooking the bigger, laboratory section. The desk wasn't locked; just rusted shut. Inside were a few cigar boxes, and in one of them was a book. It was one part personal journal, one part official logbook. Some of the sheets had a kind of inventory, others looked like chemical formulae, and finally the journal entries. Most of the entries were illegible; some water had gotten in at some point and messed up the ink. Some were fine, though. My cousin Shane laid it out on the table and read what he could out loud. Most of the dates were from late 1959 to early 1960.“Shipment of sixty baboons came in today from all over the country.” one of the first one's said. Quite a few of the first entries were like that. They had to have had a few hundred, but they could probably only hold twenty or so at a time.“Baboon 19-5 was restless today. Side effect of 020.1” there were a few like this. I remember another one was “Baboon 42-1 died of 020.2.” and so on.But the journal wasn't finished. It was only about three quarters full. Whoever was writing the journal had probably a dozen more, finished, in storage somewhere. Some of the last entries were pristine. I can still see Shane reading them with Matt and Monique peeking over his shoulder with their flashlights.“Baboon 53-3 asked for a preacher. He knows he's dying.”“Baboon 38-2 and 22-4 escaped. 22-4 died of the cold near the lake. 38-2 is still at large.”“Police stopped by the facility today. 38-2 may have talked to them.”“Baboon 38-2 was returned to us. Police weren't happy, but they had orders from high up. I told him he belonged here. He was doing more help to us than rotting in some prison. One of the officers said that nobody belonged here. I told him that 38-2 should've thought about that before raping a white woman.”It was somewhere around there than Shane stopped. Everybody got real quiet. We left. Nobody talked much, and everyone seemed sick. I was just curious as to how a baboon could talk. I didn't piece it all together until someone told me about the Tuskegee Experiments when I was in college.
2upt01	-30405	1423020786	AskHistorians	Did any ancient peoples use this technique? If so, what was it called?	I'm talking about [this] (http://i.imgur.com/BI4Qrq5.jpg). The image is a comicbook cover for a Greek god themed super hero, but I'm almost 100% sure I've seen a film where Greek or some other ancient culture used this technique in a one-on-one fight. I'm sorry I couldn't find a better picture to demonstrate. Since the picture is still, I'll explain; the fighter has a shield, spear and sword. The sword is wielded in the right hand while the shield and spear is held in the left by feeding it through the straps. When fighting, the individual would use both sword and spear fighting techniques, in addition to having a shield to defend themselves with.This doesn't seem like It would feasible for fights when the soldiers are in formation, but I could see it being used if the formation went to shit and it became every man for himself.Thank you for any and all information.

Obviously Landlocked cultures wouldn't, but much of the Arabia is near a coast line, and from what I understand, the oceans in both the Mediterrian and the Arabian Sea have plentiful whale populations. Pre-Islam Mythology seems to have a few sea monsters that might be whales, like Bahamut and Dandan, so I figure they had some experience with Whales. As for the Time period, Anything from, say, 0 BC to now.

2x30ok	-30405	1424843011	teslore	Uncommon races joining the Legion	I happened to be replaying Oblivion the other day, and some of the more common enemies you encounter are Goblins. The Goblins seem to have primitive craftsmanship, animal husbandry, farming, are capable of some magic, and have tribal social structures. its obvious that they are not animals, but the game treats them as such. You can mow down millions of them and nobody cares.The Goblin's are obviously an intelligent, if primitive, sapient species. Do any Goblins have representation in the Empire? Have any joined the Legion? Beyond Goblins, I was wondering about Giants. They too seem to be similar, and they would be useful on the battlefield. Have any joined the Legion? Are any citizens of The Empire (Or the Kingdom of Skyrim, or whatever). Goblins and Giants are the only ones I can think of, but I'm sure there are more sentient/sapient species than just the ones we're allowed to play as. 
2xjb6x	-30405	1425187435	teslore	The various duties and races in the Imperial Legion.	I'm curious about the Imperial Legion. While in game, it seems to be pretty monochrome, the lore says its made up of all different races. I was wondering what capacity these races often served in when enlisted. For example, Orcs are known to be naturally strong and tough, which would make them perfect heavy infantry. Bosmer have sharp senses and a light frame, making them good for scouting, stealth, and archery. Altmer and Bretons have natural magical abilities that would make them skilled battlemages.  So, specifically, my question is how many of X race join the Legion? (For example, how many Argonians have joined the Legion. Obviously I don't want an exact number, I just want to know how common it is among X race) What jobs do they normally have? I understand it probably isn't uniform, But I'm willing to bet most races are assigned to some jobs more than other. Are there any famous legionaries of a particular race, and if so, what are they famous for?Tying into that, how diverse is the average army? If I joined, would I find myself around a bunch of different races? Or would it mostly be one or two races that comprise the majority of the army, with only a few minorities sprinkled here and there?
2xnar4	-30405	1425279305	teslore	What is the role of the Sybil of Dibella?	So, I was reading a few things on this subreddit about Dibella, and her sphere of influence. With her, its about beauty, like physical beauty, and art and stuff, but it seems like she's essentially a God of sex. Some of her Churches seem to be more or less brothels, and institutions that teach you how to become a better lover.That's cool and all, but it raises a very, very uncomfortable thought in my head relating to a Dibella related quest in Skyrim. A few priestesses of Dibella in the Markarth Temple tell you to find the "Sybil" of Dibella. The Sybil seems to be a kind of prophet, an individual who can communicate directly to Dibella. Also, the current Sybil is a child. I feel really dirty bringing this up, but I can't ignore the implications here. The Sybil is a child, probably not even thirteen, who is part of a Sex Cult. Is there any information out there that would put my mind at ease? Like, maybe information pertaining to the duties of a Sybil, information of past sybils, and so on? Am I reading into things too much, or was that implication *supposed* to be there? I know the games and lore aren't unfamiliar with some dark, sexual, or violent themes, so it wouldn't exactly surprise me if this was the case. what gets me the most is that completing the quest makes it seem like you did something good. Handing over a child to a sex cult doesn't seem like it'd be good karma.
2z4qq8	-30405	1426434655	anime	Honest question about those of you who watch One Piece.	So I was browsing the interwebs just a few moments ago, and I landed on my favorite site for streaming cartoons and anime, and I noticed in its "recent releases" it said "One Piece Episode 687" and I got very confused, because, obviously, there's no way in hell a show has *six hundred and eighty seven episodes*. I thought it was a typo.But no. I click on it and find that there *six hundred and eighty seven* episodes. I go to Wikipedia and I find out that not only is that "just" the dubbed episodes, its still going.Now i don't want to seem too critical, I mean shit, I've spent like 1000 hours in Skyrim, so I'd be a hypocrite if i made fun; its your time, your money, that sort of thing. But how in the world does someone hop on this show and stick with it over nearly 700 episodes? There's no way a story could maintain momentum without getting tired. Shit, I only barely made it to Naruto: Shippuden before rage quitting at the prospect of another filler Arc, and i'm pretty sure I never got past the Hueco Mundo with Bleach. My question, specifically, is how does it maintain interest after so long? What keeps you from just dropping the series?
30747e	-30405	1427243283	teslore	Shapeshifting	I always like magic in fantasy settings, like TES, or Dragon Age, or Middle Earth, and one of the things that I've always thought was cool was the concept of Shapeshifting. I remember when Skyrim was just being announced, I thought shapeshifting magic would've worked well in the setting given the Nordic/Germanic style. Maybe a group of hunters who killed a certain animal could then transform into that animal via some kind of ritual or incantation. It would be magic, but magic that would still rely on physical strength and endurance, so I felt like it would fit into the Nord way of life. Also, it would be epic to turn into saber-cat or a giant spider to kick ass, or maybe turning into a mouse in order to sneak about more effectively. Of course that didn't happen, at least not exactly. There are shapeshifters in the game, in the form of werewolves and werebears, but its more of a curse than a school of magic. The Wabbajack does something similar, turning enemies into various animals and other things, but its an offensive ability and its effects are only via a powerful Daedric artifact. There's also a short subplot in the College Questline where one of your fellow apprentices accidentally turns you into a cow, a horse, and I think a dog, so it seems like the magic exists, even if it isn't widely used. I know that Jagar Tharn used illusion magic to make himself look like someone else, but that's not really shapeshifting, just an illusion.I know we haven't seen it in game, but have there been individuals in the Lore who could turn into animals (or other fantastical creatures like Trolls or Minotaurs)? If so, how did they do it? Is it a school of magic, where they just cast a spell, or was it more like a ritual, or maybe a special gift?

30reub	-30405	1427679937	teslore	Questions about magical prodigies, and the study of magic.	In a recent playthrough, after I joined the dark brotherhood, I spoke to one of the members, named Festus Krex. He mentions that he's a magic prodigy, born "with wand in hand", and casting spells at one year old. I was wondering if there's a special name for people like him, people who are savants and naturally take to magic. If someone can be born with a natural inclination towards magic, can people "Breed" their children, in hopes of making them natural wizards? If both parents had a lot of magicka, and all four grandparents did as well, would the children be more likely to have more than average magicka, or a faster magicka regeneration rate? Gameplay wise, magic is something anyone can pick up, but considering that most people aren't wizards in TES, I was wondering if that's just a gameplay mechanic. For example, would average Joe tamriel be able to learn and eventually cast powerful spells? If so, why doesn't everyone learn, at least the basics. We teach soldiers basic first aid, why not teach legionaries basic restoration magic? Maybe even simple destruction spells as well, like fire spells, in order start fires. Illusion spells to see in the dark, or Alteration spells to create lights (Is night eye still in Illusion, or is it in Alteration now? I can't remember). I'm not saying it would be feasible for every single soldier to become spell-slinging magic warriors, but if every one of them knew some basics, they'd be able to eliminate problems that real life Medieval and ancient forces had to contend with.

The Transaction history on both wallets has vanished, and I used to have a miniscule amount of coin in both wallets (About $1 worth each, I think, maybe less depending on the value that day).

Rushwallet also usually displays the conversion rate of US Dollars to Bitcoin in the upper right corner, that's gone too. I'm not gonna lie, I'm pretty illiterate when it comes to computers and such, and I don't fully understand Bitcoin or Bitcoin wallets, so when something like this changes, I get a little worried. It seems like a glitch in the site, something innocuous, maybe its down for maintenance or something, but I'm also worried it might be compromised or something. Does anyone else use this service?

This is, thankfully, a hypothetical, but something that almost happened a few hours ago. I was coming home from an errand. I'm going 20 in a 25 because its raining heavily, and even with my headlights on and wipers going full speed, I can't see all that well. A kid, probably not even ten, walks out in front of me. He was standing behind an SUV, so I couldn't see him and he couldn't see me. I braked and swerved. I hydroplanned a bit, but thankfully, I wasn't going fast enough, and I managed to give myself enough room that I only *barely* avoided hitting the kid. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that, because I was following the rules and everything, because the SUV obstructed both my view and the kids, I probably wouldn't have been charged (hopefully, the asshole who decided to park right there would've for creating a hazard, not to mention the boys parents for letting him play in the goddamn road while its raining). But the thing that worries me is the hydroplanned part. See, I used to work as a clerk at my county office, and I learned there that, at least in my county, even if you were following all the rules, if you loose control of your car, it's your fault, always. Even if you were going 10 mph under the speed limit and hit some black ice, its your fault. That's a pretty stupid rule unto itself, but I'm wondering if it would apply here. If I was doing everything I said, if my car hydroplaned into the kid, what would've happened, legally?Edit: I live in the United States of America, in the state of Ohio.Edit2: I appreciate the responses, although I have to wonder about the downvotes. I don't know who downvoted me or why. I'd like a response to that, especially considering I was just expressing a pretty reasonable opinion. I've been reading over some the other posts, and you guys have a major problem with people spamming the downvote button for dumb reasons. I suspect you guys really, really hate it when people talk about the inequalities inherent in the system and how mundane shit, like briefly losing control of your car even though you were doing everything not to, can fuck you financially. Morally, I didn't do anything wrong in this situation. It could easily happen to anyone, even if they were, like me, doing everything they could to prevent it, and it could easily send me to prison, force a huge fine on me, or take away my license, all of which would ruin me for something that straight up wasn't my fault.   Edit3: thank you, /u/damageddude, for citing sources and allowing me to read it for myself. I can't be 100% certain, because this situation is complicated and I'm not a Lawyer, but I'm reasonably certain that I wouldn't find myself in jail. I've read several articles about the subject, even one that was rather uncannily similar to mine, and I found that while civil suits are likely, criminal charges really aren't. I really appreciate the legal advice, from those of you who actually *gave* legal advice. Other than /u/damageddude, or someone who is actually willing to cite sources, I won't be replying to anyone anymore. There's too much vitrol and I'm over it. To the mods, I highly doubt you're reading this, but you might want to consider policing the subreddit a bit more. I was very happy to find someone who could give me legal advice, but I had to wade through people who were significantly less than helpful. Upon looking through some other threads, I found *a lot* of similar situations.

2934be	-30408	1403726078	Guitar	Hagstrom J-45	I was hoping to find out more about the guitar my Grandfather left me, as I know absolutely nothing about guitars. I'd be interested in finding out its year of production and possibly even it's original market price. The model number is 129318. Also, I am interested in getting it restored. It's a little beaten and battered from the years, though all damage seems aesthetic, as it's pitch and tone seems perfectly fine, as does the shape of the guitar. The damage seems to be quite a fair bit of hairline cracks or scratches on the undercoat. As well as this, there are certain areas with the coating completely chipped off, though the surface area exposure is limited to roughly 3mm by 3mm. Would it be possible to restore the guitar to it's original state, and if so, what am I likely to pay for such a service? I can provide some pictures on request, if necessary.

2it6ic	-30408	1412900157	tifu	TIFU by losing my passport	It was a warm summers day, the sun shone upon little Scotland. A land of pale skinned aggressive misfits. But in their misfitting ways, they were brought together. The misfits fit. So much so, that a certain group of misfits were taking their odd nature and culture to unexplored lands. Magaluf... The boys departed, from one sun to another. They all felt a great excitement, for they knew, or at least thought they knew, that this would be the greatest two weeks of their life. One young boy was sorely mistaken... "Mate, can I put my shit in your locker" "Aye, put it in later before we go out, I don't have the key the now." And with those words. The ball was set in motion.... A few drinks later at a spirited pre-booze up and harmless little Docoe finds himself heading down to the strip. Out Clothes on, quiff up, and ready to add to the little drink he'd already had. He approaches the bouncer and the cashier, swooping the pockets for the 30 quid, only to find his ID filled wallet, his passport and 1000 in euros. "Am a pure stupid dick" he thinks. "I forgot to put my shit in the locker, oh well, I'll just take it easy with the drink tonight." And with that, life's irony rains from the sky, and kicks him straight in his bollocks... He has one drink, on top of his tame pre-drinking. A nice vodka blackcurrent lemonade is what your wanting. Maybe he stuttered. As he asked for his first real drink of the night, maybe he said it too quick and it sounded a lot like "a vodka black curr-spike me-ent lemonade", for that was what he got. And with that, fast forwarding a few hours, but what felt like a slow blink, Docoe, or as he would come to be known, "mista  anonymoiso" is awoken to the bright lights of the Palma hospital, a hospital gown richer, a grand lesser and destined to swim home, because you don't need a passport for rubber wings. While poor Docoe was bewildered and devastated, 13 days later, following various grillings from his mum and dad back home, and after a few money transfers and a trip to the British Embassy, Docoe finally found him self back home, ready to be referred to as "the retard who lost his passport"

I think this is a simple element that would bring a lot to the PVP portion of the game. Thoughts?

I am starting my own side business and hoping to eventually make it to a full time company. I am in the trade industry with many years working in peoples homes and commercial buildings and I am going to be starting a business that does energy auditing and surveying to find problems for customers so they can solve them to save money.I got the equipment/tool already ordered for what I need. I will be flying out of state to get some extra certification training to be credible and learn anything extra I can.Next is setting up the business. I will file for a business name and get a business license, get a company cell phone, business cards, bookkeeping and invoicing software, and a good accountant. Then I will be working on marketing information (flyers/website and such)  for the services I provide. Then I will start networking to people in the trade fields that could use my services also other companies and individuals that can benefit from what I provide.I was wondering if their are any tips or something I may be overlooking so far? I have a pretty solid idea where I want to take the company and have already worked out and cost structured my services. Thanks

1c8p62	-30419	1365811660	AskReddit	What topics of conversation come up between you and your SO on a typical day?	I have a hard time sustaining conversations with people. Essentially, I tend to have conversations where I'm self-effacing and cut short so I can get the heck away from the person (social anxiety taking control). It makes dating challenging, but relationships even harder. I'm always afraid I won't have anything worth talking about or anything smart to say if I get into a relationship...and if I don't have anything smart to say...the person won't want to date me. Essentially, I'm convinced I'm better off alone forever.So...folks who have healthy relationships with your SO...am I thinking too much into this? What conversations come up on a typical day in your relationship? Are mundane conversations common or mundane conversations signal to you that your relationship is faltering?

But too much can taint other people's opinion of your SO and that can be damaging for the relationship...so Reddit, what do you do?
1xyhxb	-30419	1392437392	AskReddit	How often do you fight with your SO and how heated does it get?	I saw a couple fighting on the train and the fight went "You never apologize for anything, you don't care about what I want" etc. With grievances like that, from an outsider's POV, it looked like the relationship wouldn't last the long haul. Would I be wrong to say that? Can you qualify the fights you have with your SO? How do you know the fights are just that, and not the end of a relationship?

It'll all be fine for the first half hour or so of game play, and then maybe 45 minutes in, the game will stutter for a few seconds and all sound will be gone until I quit and open TF2 again.  Sorry for asking here but I tried googling and couldn't find this specific problem with the sound.

dnzuz	-30420	1286445979	Seattle	Can someone explain your public radio to me?	I've been here about two months now and it's a little confusing.  Back in Minneapolis, we had [Minnesota Public Radio](http://minnesota.publicradio.org/).  MPR ran three stations: one for news, one for classic/jazz, and one (amazing) station for current/local/alternative music, which seems to be very similar to your KEXP.  But they were all MPR stations, and you could give to MPR and you'd be funding them all.I've gathered that there are at least two different public radio companies here, KUOW and KPLU, operating 2, possibly 3 stations with redundant news and music programming.  What's the deal here?  Seems inefficient to me, I didn't even know you could have competing public radio stations in an area.
grdgg	-30420	1302946018	nookcolor	NESoid + Wiimote on CM7	Anyone else got this working?  I've managed to enable bluetooth, get the wiimote to paired with WiimoteController, I can even go into the input settings and successfully map keys by pressing buttons on the wiimote, but then when I go back to the actual game, no input seems to register at all from the wiimote.I tried SNESoid, and I got the same result.  The frustrating part is that it's clearly seeing my input when I'm mapping the keys, but not at all in game.  SNEX9x however seems to work perfectly, but it contains it's own version of wiimote pairing that doesn't require WiimoteController.**EDIT:** Guess I jumped the gun on posting this, figured it out minutes afterward.  And because I don't want to be that guy who doesn't post the solution, I went into Settings -&gt; Other Settings -&gt; and checked "Use input method" and voila, works perfectly.
guzxm	-30420	1303353498	nookcolor	Multiple "user profiles" on the Nook	I'm trying to decide how best to handle a two user situation with my Nook. It doesn't seem like there's any real Android solution to having mulitple users like you would on a PC, so I'm exploring other options.The first would having a whole bootable image on an SD card dedicated to one person, and the EMMC to the other, but I have a question about that.  Does anyone know if running CM7 off of an SD card is significantly slower than off of EMMC? I'd like to hear about experiences with that if anyone's done it.The second is dividing the EMMC into two partitions, and somehow being able to choose between them at boot.  I don't actually know if this is possible, but if anyone's done something similar I'd like to hear about that as well.
pvl2b	-30420	1329596939	asoiaf	Jaqen's Hair? (spoilers all)	I've finished ADWD and poured over this subreddit, picking up on all the things I missed during my first read through, but I don't think I've seen this mentioned and it's left my wondering:Is there any significance to Jaqen H'ghar's hair coloring?  White on one side and Red on the other is obviously reminiscent of the Faceless Men's House of Black and White and the coloring that goes on there.  But after Arya saves Jaqen and co. from burning to death, he specifically mentions the red god Rh'llor.  Being saved from fire ties in there, but could Jaqen's hair coloring also indicate he has a stronger tie to R'hllor than other FM?  Or is his hair just part of his current disguise and nothing more?

ro9ue	-30420	1333305553	asoiaf	(Spoiler ALL) Generations of Targaryens in the show vs. in the books?	So I'm re-watching the show last night, and Aemon does his little rant about how his family was all killed and such, but I notice he seems to leave some people out.  He says that his brother's son was the Mad King Aerys, skipping right over the King Jahaerys and crew generation.  Has anyone from the show or GRRM commented on why they just completely leave them out?  It sorta makes Barristan's whole "I've served three kings" thing a bit less meaningful, as well as messing with the family tree.EDIT: Just realized I had assumed if Jahaerys didn't exist, Barristan would have only served 2 kings, but I suppose they could just as easily say he served Aegon if they do it that way.  Still, I don't like the possibility that Duncan the Small never existed!  Also, doesn't it potentially mess up the Baratheon claim to the throne too?

Angular speed seems to be capped based on the agent's speed and acceleration, but even by upping both angular speed and acceleration to ridiculous values the agents are still sliding around sideways through turns.  Upping the agent's overall speed might do it, but I need them to be somewhat slow moving, just turning faster.

Forgive me if this is simple, I'm still pretty new to Arduino/electronics in general, but I'm not sure why this is happening.So I've got this Pro Micro recently and I'm running some tests on it to make sure it works before I hook it up to other hardware.  I put a single LED on pin 8/ground, run a blink program, works fine.  I measure 4.8v coming off that pin, good.I change it up to see what I get off the VCC pin, which I also measure to be 4.8v, and it kills the LED with a small pop, every time.  Why does this work on my Uno (with the 5v output/ground) and not the Pro Micro?  Both are being powered with a USB cable from my computer.  [Here's a picture of the setup](http://i.imgur.com/unVgkyG.jpg), any help would be appreciated.

I have a 1 TB drive with ~350 GB already used, and a 500 GB Apple Time Capsule. what's the best way to go about doing an OS swap?

u0w69	-30423	1337775689	NoFap	I think I'll give it a shot.	I have low self-esteem. I'm entering young adulthood and I've never had a girlfriend. I've just never felt confident. and I have never been able to talk to a girl I've been interested in. I don't masturbate daily, But I want to get out of it before that starts. I'm also joining a gym to help improve my body, to improve my health and to keep my mind off of my penis.

He was skeptical at first, but ultimately agreed it was a good idea. for the first few weeks we would casually update each other about our progress and thoughts so far. I then realized that we had inadvertently become accountability buddies.If you have  a friend that has similar views and motives for doing NoFap, keep each other accountable. You'll be glad you did.

No wonder the freaking ER takes forever!!! Huntsville Hospital has never been known for being efficient - you would think someone would have opened one by now! Even going to the new Madison hospital, it was still 3-1/2 hours for some stitches. The closest 24 hour place we could find was Guntersville.

I've noticed that my painkillers are going missing (nothing strong, just Ultram), and I'm 99% certain that it's my wife. I don't feel like we've been happy in a long time - we just sit there and ignore each other all evening almost every night, very infrequent intimacy, etc. I don't know whether to just tell her to leave, or to ask her to get help for the pills and see if things improve or what to do. Any advice?Edit #1 - I'm planning to talk to her about the missing pills tonight - we'll see where it goes from there I guess.Edit #2 - I honestly think my kids would be glad to see us split up, as long as they can stay with me - they don't have a good relationship with her either. I think she feels like they're both not living up to their potential (granted, one of them really isn't), and she rides them pretty hard about little stuff. Then she wonders why they don't talk to her about anything....

I am so zoned into the world of my computer screen that I sometimes feel like my body is functioning without me even feeling it.What the hell.Anyways, I have a dilemma on my hands.  People of reddit please help me find an album!  (SKIP DOWN TO CAPS IN PARENTHESIS FOR SHORT VERSION)------------------While browsing Pandora at work today, I heard a fantastic song which was played from my "Sigur Ros" (artist) station.  I played it two or three times on youtube and wanted to remember it, yet as work and other events of the day passed by the name slipped my mind.  You would think that I would have been smart enough to "Like" it on Pandora but once again I managed to forget something important/interesting.If any of you have any idea who this artist might be, let me know.Hopefully someone can help me string these clues together, then I will be at peace of mind.  This is seriously driving me crazy.I know this was wordy but I cannot remember a dang thing about the song that I liked so much.  Thanks to anyone who stumbles upon this and might have a clue of what the song is.-------------------(START HERE FOR SHORT VERSION)Here is what I remember about the song/album cover:The album cover has a red, autumn blend to it.  There is an owl on the album cover.The song style is dreamy/synthetic but is produced without harsh electronic sounds.  There are little vocals, if any at all.The name of the album that the song is from starts with an "A" (I think)...Thank you guys :)edit:  Fixed errors, because I can hardly do this right now.  :&gt;

103uau	-30446	1348010511	trees	Venting	So I am currently at a shoreline 5 and enjoying life.  Then today I started to browse Facebook (I've had it back now for a month and am actually using it the right way, by the way)--and then I saw what I feared I would see on Facebook.  My old soccer captain's little brother had completed the rites of passage to the Marines, and stood astutely in a photo, dressed in the drying green camouflage; the U.S.A. foot soldier uniform.  He had done it!  He was in.I am simply expressing myself, and I understand that there are Marines on reddit, but I mean no disrespect to the men and women who serve--I am, however, trying to observe how Marines understand their role.Allow me to explain.  This old friend of mine--the older brother--has expressed his admiration for the rigorous, focused, disciplinary academy his younger brother has been admitted to.  He himself is studying to become a pilot for the Marines/Airforce (can't remember which).  He has also expressed that he does not wish for the U.S. to be in conflict in the Middle East, but does not hesitate to inform others that he is man enough to fight and die if he needs to.  But what does that mean?*U.S. presence in the world--as vague as that is, it is.  As a security force?  Of course; we assume this as Americans, I suppose.  An unending draft of volunteers.*And then the other night, a self-declared Marine approached my friend and said, "Dude, I would die for you.  Like that's what I am, a Marine.  I would die for anyone!" (thought I will admit he may have been tipsy, my friend accounts for this event, not me).  All in all, he sounded quite convinced that he was a potential self-sacrificing hero of the U.S. Marines Corps.How do I express myself?My old friend, I wish you could see the beautiful things your brother can create rather than praise the life he is laying down for no man, but an idea, an idea that we cannot control ourselves, that we must defend against "terror" at absolutely any cost.Is anyone else getting a sick feeling from war and soldiers and machines?I am sorry if I sound arrogant or if I am assuming a lot.  I tend to do that when I think alone.Edit:  clarified a thought*

I then proceeded to light the filter end of the cigarette with the tobacco &amp; otherwise synthetic material in my mouth.  I didn't smoke it down far, for when I realized that I lit the filter, I cracked up like a fool in the neighborhood apartments.   But I definitely smoked something weird.  Crap.  I can't tell you how funny the cigarette looks.. Wish I had a working camera.

My sleep pattern has forced me away from seeing her wake up, and I'm beginning to forget her scent.  Morning rain and peaches, peachy skin.  It fills the white room.A knock on the door!  Melinda?She comes in.There are two small vials in her hand for me.  I can rest easy since you will be here, since you came back so early from work, we can rest easy together.She places the two vials in my hand and as I talk to her (her smile light and tilted) her hair begins to fall out.  She is comforting me.  She strokes my shoulders, but her nails shorten and her hands wrinkle.  Her red lips faded to a chalky pink, and her peach skin begins to smell like mouthwash.  Mouthwash and rubber, and tinges of cleaning liquids.Would you like to see Melinda, Alex?I can see you.Melinda is outside, Alex.  Would you like to see her?You can stay here, can't you?A stranger comes inside.A light vibration tickles the inside of my enclosed hand, the hand which Melinda holds up like a fortune teller.  The vials are shaking in my still hand, and they are suddenly much louder--vvvvvvvvv--than Melinda.  Two flies spit from my loosened grip.I watch the flies for hours.The nurse locks the door.Melinda crawls into bed when the flies land on my lips.
1989u5	-30446	1361842039	Teachers	I need advice for tutoring an 8-year old boy with dyslexia.	Hey guys. I'm a volunteer at an after-school program for kids 6-10 in Ohio.The past few times, a young boy has requested that I help him with his reading/vocabulary homework. He has some sort of dyslexia. His goal is to get his homework done as quickly as possible, and he demands that I read the vocab words to him and read the sentences to him. He is supposed to place each word into the appropriate sentence, all of which have one blank in them. For example,Car / Dog / MomDid you hear the _____ bark? Listen to the engine in that ___. Did your __ help you get ready for school today?He is an 8 year old in the 1st grade. I do not know what do. General tips? I try to encourage him but he gets teary eyed and frustrated--even unwilling to continue--when I insist that he reads along with me. Insist is a strong word. I usually ask him to, but the past 2 times, I've given up and pretty much spoon fed him his homework. It was heartbreaking, and I don't want to do that anymore. He claims that this method is how he goes about schoolwork every day :(I want to help him learn to read. Good God do I want to help him.TL;DR   Any advice for helping students overcome dyslexia?edit: Idk why DID YOUR is bold. Crud.

2osacs	-30452	1418154430	GradSchool	What approaches should I take looking for PhD programs to apply to (Criminal Justice/Homeland Security)?	I am a 45 year old student currently in a Masters Program at South University  (most of my courses are online, but there is a brick and mortar facility in my town);  I am halfway through with a 4.0 average; 3 quarters to go.What I'm looking for are some ideas on HOW to find out which PhD programs would be a good fit for me.  There are also some areas in which I'm not even sure which questions I should be asking.Should I start by compiling a list of all programs, and just start emailing questions...Does the the theoretical bent of the faculty matter ( I consider myself closest to being a right realist), and something to look for...My own interest is in the politics that influences security policy (both domestic security and criminal enforcement);should I identify programs whose faculty interests are similar...I am either getting general application advice or irrelevant results from the google/bing searches I am using, so I am hoping to get some hints here.  Thanks!

I have also seen suggestions here and there that grading in grad school (social sciences at least) can be more lenient than undergraduate.Does anyone have a comparison through personal experience between online and brick and mortar?
3ar2fx	-30452	1435005538	gradadmissions	When I inquire about acceptance into PhD program, should I mention veteran's waiver of tuition?	I am about to begin applying to some programs here in Texas, all at public schools.  Texas has the Hazelwood Act which waives tuition costs for veterans (me).The school is not reimbursed for the tuition, this is a waiver.  Personally, I was going to bring it up as part of the application process, as I thought it would be a plus as far as funding goes.  However, I read that funding shouldn't be brought up at all initially, and then had the question as to whether that loss of tuition money could be an issue.I still think I should bring the issue up, but would like additional opinion.  Thanks!

Women have described me as tiny, skinny, pocketsized, cute, and my personal favorite, nonthreatening. I can make friends with just about anyone, but rare is the day that a girl likes me enough to go on a first date. I don't project neediness, and I don't kiss ass hoping for sex. In short, I'm not a niceguy, but I still don't have the successful LTR I've always wanted. On the flip side, I've also been told that I'm too good or out of her league by several girls. I get treated like they think I'm an egotistical douche just for being confident in myself and wearing nice clothes. On more than one occasion I've been used for sex and then never called back again like I don't exist. I wouldn't mind those situations honestly, if there was some sort of continued dialogue between us, but it's like they're ashamed to be associated with me and don't want anyone to know that we were together.My theory is that it's just not socially acceptable for a woman to be attracted to a short man, and it's the worst kind of hell imaginable. I started /r/nofap about a year ago, and that has also boosted my confidence and self-esteem tremendously, but so far it has done nothing to change the way women look at me. I'm starting to think maybe I'm better off just masturbating to porn and waiting to die alone than put all this effort in for nothing. If anyone is going to give me a straight answer, I figure it will be here.

1jsotr	-30463	1375770334	TheRedPill	Guys, I've never been a believer in anything more in my life than The Red Pill.	I'm not even sure where to begin anymore. Little by little, the mindset I had that it was possible to find a good honest woman who would love me the same way I loved her eroded until finally one day, I snapped. I had previously taken the Red Pill, but the effects hadn't really sunk into my brain yet. I was aware of the concepts, but had not truly applied any of the knowledge. Something was holding me back. Guilt? Shame? Fear? An aching desire for this all to be just a bad dream that I would wake up from, move on with my life, find a woman who loved me for me, and make a success of myself, have kids, get married, grow old, and die happy? Yeah, probably that one. The day that I snapped occurred shortly after I decided to give good old fashioned monogamy one last final chance after a lifetime of monotonous heartbreaks and ego stompings. I lowered my standards considerably. I was willing to put all my eggs in the basket of a young woman who was not good looking, not particularly interesting beyond having similar hobbies, and basically just not really much of a catch. I didn't even want sex. I would be the perfect boyfriend. She would have everything she could ever want that was within my power to give, and I would ask nothing in return but her loyalty and affection. No matter what, I would embrace her family as my own, and go out of my way to make her days special. I wanted this.As luck would have it, a female acquaintance who was mysteriously interested in me--for reasons I had yet to realize--, but had a boyfriend, pointed me in the direction of just such a girl that had recently expressed interest in myself. Let's say her name was Lucy. Lucy was by no means a good looking girl, but to her credit, was not exactly overweight, and for the most part, seemed to have a nice, if not exactly pleasant, demeanor. But there was something I couldn't put my finger on that was rubbing me the wrong way. Still, at face value, she wasn't giving me a reason to dislike her beyond not finding her to be terribly desirable.Lucy was a nerd. A nerd in the way that other nerds cannot help but want to throw themselves at her because she's one of the rare ones who actually openly likes nerdy things. I noted her small harem of males in the cafeteria where they gathered with laptops next to power outlets in order to browse MLP and anime together as I made my approach. I was not at all fazed by the attention they were lapping her with, but also not aware entirely of how foolish I was for being pure of heart in my intentions.Even the tall submissive black athletic nerd with abs was no match for my confidence, which wasn't really so much as confidence as it was apathy for my perceived lot in life. Still, I managed to break past her small bubble of cautious protectors, and introduced myself. Lucy was already quite aware of my presence, as she was always vigilant to watch for me when I would enter the cafeteria as my friendly acquaintance had pointed out. (I was oblivious to the attention I received from the women around me daily still because up until that point my head was always down and my thoughts were introverted and into myself too much to see the world around me.)We talked, and I ignored her friends who never missed a chance to butt in, getting uncomfortably close, talking about Garry's Mod, MLP, and other such juvenile internet obscurity. It didn't take long for her to realize I was a cut above the rest of these schmucks as far as my willingness to believe in her facade. Part of me was aware that she was putting on some kind of front, but another part of me was still doubtful of that reality, and rather hopeful that she would turn out to be a kindhearted honest soul like myself. After all, she didn't have much of a leg to stand on as far as her SMV went. For fuck sake, she had a slightly hairy upper lip. If I'd of wanted her for sex, I'd've need to be blindfolded or fucking her from behind while imagining she was someone else. Still, I played everything mostly nice, but I wasn't willing to let her think I was a wimp. I went for the kill. I knew she was into me, and I told her such. I said we should date. She was resistant at first, and this annoyed me, so I was ready to leave. 'Fuck this shit', I thought, but as I was getting ready to leave, she stopped me. Little did I know that this was simply another shit test. She wanted me. She wanted me more now than before. She knew I was willing to walk away in the face of her awfulness. She was weak. She needed me to stay. Needed me to give her a chance to prove she didn't need me.I acquiesced. Our first date did not occur for two weeks, as both of us were busy with finals, and when I say date, I mean, I picked her up from class and we went to her home out in the country. Not the backwoods kinda country, but more of a civilized kinda country with a small town on the outskirts and a Walmart within 25 miles. Beautiful place to live. It made me realize how much I love the simple life. We played Borderlands on co-op up in her room for several hours, breaking once for hot pockets, which she tried to pressure me to eat more than one of. (I'm conscious of what I put in my mouth. Sue me.) I noted all the DLCs and extra special edition collection type paraphernalia she happened to be in possession of. I inquired, and learned that most of it was given to her as gifts from her nerd friends, who I now fully recognize to be beta orbiters. I would never dream of paying full price for most of that shit in my more cynical mid-twenties, let alone giving them away. One of them even GAVE her a red 3DS after she refused to accept the pink one he bought her. He kept the pink one. (Are you fucking shitting me?)I looked at her book shelf and was not at all surprised to see the latest female sex fantasy books like Twlight and City of [insert random word here] as well as harem mangas and internet culture/comic books lining the two or three rows, intermixed with the odd geeky display piece here and there. Everything was going swimmingly until we decided to go for a walk out on the country roads with her slutty sister that tagged along, who I immediately found more attractive for her fun loving attitude and big tits. Lucy noticed my enhanced positive attitude, no doubt thanks to her sister's enormous melons and propensity to drop titillating sexual remarks, regardless of my diligence to remain solidly by her side. Lucy wasted no time in making comments that attacked my masculinity. Commented sharply that I was 'pocket-sized' even though I still had some inches on her in height. (I'm short for a guy. Ouch, never been picked on for that one before.) Then later claimed that instead of choosing for us which path to take, as opposed to when I asked her opinion which way  to go--way out in the country where I've never been in before--that I wasn't much of a leader or someone who could make decisions for us.For some reason, it was this that caused me to snap. They were small off-putting shit tests, but dammit, I had all the proof I needed being nice simply doesn't work. I realized I no longer gave a shit about fucking ANYTHING. This was all just another joke to her. What a shameless fat selfish ugly stupid cunt. Bitch didn't even want to hold my hand without considerable coaxing and resistance on her part, regardless of how nice and generous I was with my attention.As we were walking back, about a mile out from the house, she commented on being tired, even though her sister was kinda worse for ware without so much as a peep. If I hadn't needed directions for how to get back on the highway in order to get the fuck outta there, I would have gave her a piece of my mind, but instead I chose something more devious. "I'll carry you." Ten slow, wobbly steps later, she conceded that I was having a hard time giving a piggyback ride, and wanted back down. Without saying it directly, I had conveyed she was a fat fucking princess, even though I could have easily carried her the whole way back. But that shit would stick with her well after I'd found my way back to civilization. I planted the seeds of doubt and insecurity, which she most certainly needed. It was my parting gift, something I'd learned from years of being manipulated by harpies like her.I never officially broke up with her, because I didn't feel the need to say it. I knew what I was. While I was out talking to literally any girl that made eye contact with me, and actually getting laid, she stewed at home, playing Oblivion, wondering when I would call her. Finally, as I was coming back from my trip to Vegas (where I nailed two hot young black girls), I got a long-winded message over FB detailing how she didn't feel appreciated enough and that she thought we should just be friends. "Lol k."

vd9b5	-30478	1340254711	LV426	Ok so I just came up with a small Prometheus theory. 	Through all the reading I have done on the movie Prometheus and it has been a lot, a sudden light bulb flickered on in my head.-The Engineers are the titan Prometheus, I know what you are thinking duh but hear me out. [This link](http://io9.com/5919306/another-theory-about-the-meaning-of-prometheus) was the kernel that poped for me it mentions that the Engineers where given the task of creating life by something else higher in the food chain (lets call them the Others) so to speak. My thought is that they made humanity, then like Prometheus gave us fire or as I see it knowledge which was a big no no. The knowledge given was the event that happened 2000 years ago. They came down to earth to try and help us get on track by telling us how it was. The fact that we didn't take so kindly to it and nailed space jeez to a plank is a small foot note. So the Others find out that the Engineers were not following protocol they turn the black goo from "hey its awesome it makes life mode" to "say hi to your entrails mode". The Engineers realizing their folly, and still having open wound about man, decide FUCK EARTH not knowing the goo is out to get 'em. So, on the way to that FUCK EARTH idea shit goes wrong. The Engineers were not ordered to destroy earth they just wanted to cause we bit the hand that fed us. The Others however, had the idea that we would destroy ourselves so why waste time sending a team to do it. They just needed to to punish the workers that botched the experiment.That is my idea tell me what you think&lt;--- like I have to say that

3d5umz	-30484	1436815966	ShitTheAdminsSay	A couple updates to the sub	Firstly, I set up Automoderator so if you say an admin's name it will automatically set that as the flair.   So if you post something like "deimorz said this thing" you will not have to worry about adding deimorz flair.   To add on to this I changed the name of "flair" to "Select An Admin" to make it less confusing.  Secondly, I fixed the search box on the sidebar by completely getting rid of it.  It only had a few names and I felt it wasn't doing anyone justice.  I set up a wiki ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitTheAdminsSay/wiki/search)) with a nice alphabetical list of all the admins this time.   There is a link to it in the sidebar where the box use to be. And as always thanks for being such an awesome community :)

This is a game I saw around 8 years ago, it was a simple game rendered in 3D but the gameplay was on a 2D axis (left to right flightpath of airplane, skydiver drops under that flightpath).Colourscheme was darkened desert oranges with purple added to the sky.There was ragdoll applied to the skydiver once he hit the platform and could roll off it, if there was too much momentum.Played this on GNU/Linux (think it used SDL libraries) but it may be available on other platforms.Spacebar to drop the jumper was the only control (a second press may have opened the parachute).&amp;nbsp;All leads appreciated.

I was 13 at the time and my friends and I were hanging out at the playground at our elementary school. My friends were Mikey, Ryan, and Taylor. We were all around the same age.So we stayed there until about 9 and decided to go home because it was getting dark. Some of us had scooters and some were on foot. We start to leave the campus and stopped at the intersection and just before we left I realized I left my jacket at the playground, so everyone waits while I go back to grab it. While I get it, I see a truck pull up about 200 yards away from me and two guys get out. I thought it was a little weird because two grown looking men were coming onto an elementary campus at 9 at night.I watched them while walking to my jacket and I saw they were carrying something kinda long. Looked like a pole. As I grab my jacket I hear a gunshot. Now I've been raised shooting guns so I know what it sounds like. Nothing else makes that echoing, piercing sound. I freaked and jumped on my scooter and went as fast as I could in the opposite direction, back to my friends. They shot over and over and I had no idea where the were aiming, but it terrified me so I was going as fast as I could. I could hear my phone ringing and when I got to the intersection I just yelled at my friends to run. So we're all running away from the school and the gunshots sound like they're getting closer. While I'm running I realize the only one up with me is Ryan. We just keep running until we turn into his neighborhood and we stop there. We're panting and I ask him "Where the hell is Mikey and Taylor?!" and he said he didn't know, so we were freaking out. Then we see about 3 or 4 cop cars speeding down the road passed his neighborhood entrance towards the school. Taylor and Mikey finally catch up to us and said they stopped because Mikey dropped his iphone. (Dumb I know.) We run farther into the neighborhood and hear a few more cop cars go by and we see a police helicopter fly over towards the school.We stay at the park in his neighborhood to calm down. We agree not to tell any of our parents because we were afraid they would restrict our curfew. We go back to Ryan's house all shaken and continue hanging out.The weird part is we never heard anything about it again. I looked it up a few nights later and I can't find anything about it in the news or on the police reports. We live in a kinda small town so this would have made the news for sure and would have become common knowledge. I tell my family about 6 months later and they don't believe me because they said I would have told them sooner if it really happen. My friends and I talk about it every once in awhile. No one we know has heard about it and everyone that lives around there claims they didn't hear the sirens.Not too crazy, but I think it's really weird that people shooting guns at an elementary school doesn't make our news and I can't find it anywhere.TL;DR some guys shot guns at my old elementary school and no one knows about it and it isn't on the local police reports.Edit: Totally forgot to say that my phone was ringing because Ryan was calling me to see if I was okay.

I hear they're not the friendliest, but that they can be tamed with time. Thoughts? If so how much time did it take you? 2) General feeding response. How eager are they to eat? I know every snake has its own personality and habits but I would like to hear some personal stories. 3) This may sound a little strange, but how do they feel? I heard in passing that their scales are arranged in a different way, is this true? If so does it make them feel smoother or rougher?

290mem	-30507	1403657917	snakes	USARK needs our help.	The U.S FWS is considering adding 5 new species of snakes to the Lacey Act as injurious.  (Boa constrictor, Reticulated python, DeSchauensee’s anaconda, Green anaconda and Beni anaconda). If this becomes law it would be illegal to take these snakes across state lines, even to receive medical care, not to mention they would just about disappear from the pet trade. After the first set of snake bans under this law, I've never seen a single Burmese python at a reptile show and I've been through a big part of Texas going to reptile shows.  It would mean a lot to me and reptile keepers everywhere if you guys could take the time and make your thoughts known here. http://www.regulations.gov/#!submitComment;D=FWS-R9-FHC-2008-0015-4570In regards to that particular link USARK's website says "below are guidelines for comments:  We are seeking new information from the public only for five mentioned species. Comments on other species will not be considered. FWS has requested comments or information from government agencies, the scientific community, industry, pet owners, small businesses or other interested parties concerning the proposed rule.  Desired information includes, but is not limited to, the biology of the five species, existing regulations that apply to the five species, the economic effect on wholesale, retail and ancillary sales, impairment to educational activities and any other information relevant to the proposed rule and associated documents."   
296vj7	-30507	1403821707	snakes	USARK's Second Request	As some of you may have noticed, the previous request by USARK to write comments in opposition to the proposed legislation against five more species of snakes only allowed a period of 30 days for comments to be submitted. USARK is now asking its supporters to go to http://www.regulations.gov/#!submitComment;D=FWS-R9-FHC-2008-0015-4570 and submit comments that request an extension on the time period comments can be submitted. This action will allow more people to join our cause as time goes on as well as allow professionals and experts the time they need to present advanced arguments using their expertise.The following are talking points USARK would like us to use when writing our comments: "A significant amount of time has passed since the last opportunity for public comment closed in 2010.Substantial new biological and economic information has become available since the end of the last comment period.The proposed listings will have severe educational, economic, conservation and scientific impacts, and therefore adequate time for submissions is necessary.Tens of thousands of responsible pet keepers will also be negatively affected.Reptile owners are a diverse group, so extra time is needed to ensure that all concerns are heard. This is particularly true for military service members."USARK has also included their own response which can be seen using the following link. www.usark.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/USARK_Request_for_Extension.pdf
29pmfi	-30507	1404358745	snakes	Feeding response captive/wild	Take two species of snakes, corn snakes and ball pythons. The corn is known for its strong feeding response and the ball can tend to skip a few meals from time to time. Is this pattern similar in their natural habitats or did the ball python loose some of its appetite during the time it has been bred in captivity. Before anyone answers I am aware that: 1.) Snakes don't automatically eat once a week appropriate sized meals and that in the wild food can be scarce2.) That in the winter/breeding season snakes' appetites tend to die down3.) A good amount of snakes just sit in one place and eat what comes by as opposed to going out to hunt. My question is, are wild corn snakes voracious eating machines and do wild ball pythons take the slow and steady approach to getting food?  This is a bit of a complicated question and I'm not sure if anyone has an answer, but I would like to hear from you guys.

I'm considering breeding my own mice/rats, but I have quite a few specific questions I can't seem to find detailed answers for. First of all I would like to hear people's opinions on how hard breeding mice is compared to breeding rats (leave out smell because my nose hardly works). Also I would like to know where people who breed their own rodents get their original breeders. Pet stores I've been to usually have myco infected rodents. I've even read on one website that sells rodents that they started with sneezing pet store rodents and have since cultivated a healthy breeding population. How did they do it? I would like to hear people's opinions on diet; Do you feed lab blocks or do you make your own diet. If you use a homemade diet what does it consist of and how much money do you save compared to lab blocks. Any other tips/tricks/hints/problems I might run into would be appreciated.

I had never heard of them and he explained what they were. He always though our conversations were worth sharing and I agreed. So we bought a mic and a game capture device and started in on it. It isn't as easy as he had thought and every day he comes downstairs to tell me how many more views we have on the youtube channel or if someone liked something on the facebook page. He gets so giddy every time we release or record something and I've never seen him so excited. But the views and feedback haven't been pouring in as quickly as he would like. He's considered paying for advertising and other things which I have quickly talked him down from but I think it bothers him that things weren't an instant success. This is why I have come to you my friends.Today is my best friends 25th birthday and I ask if you dear sweet redditors could do me a solid and check out the youtube channel and facebook. Leave messages, like things, whatever. I just really want him to see this thing go somewhere.

33wsgz	-30510	1430046767	leagueoflegends	The new Ryze	The new ultimate of Ryze, although very strong, might be a bit of an overkill. As of now, it grants these stats.&gt;Desperate Power (R)Passive: Ryze gains 10/20/30% Cooldown Reduction &gt;Active: Ryze gains 80 movement speed and 15/20/25% Spell Vamp for 4/5/6 seconds. During this time, Ryze's spells deal 50% additional damage to enemies near his targets&gt;Cooldown: 80/60/40I think that 30% CDR is too much. They should shift the power of this much CDR onto other spells.Why?Because it nerfs his build path and mastery set.Before, you usually went either 9/0/21 or 0/9/21 giving you a big amount of CDR from masteries already.Together with a Frozen Heart, which almost every Ryze picked up, he reached 40% CDR together with his Q being leveled up. Although this might be a slight buff to his late game as he does not need to build any additional CDR, a Frozen Heart is almost always a nice pickup on a Ryze unless he plays vs the likes of Corki.Don't you think that 30% CDR is a bit too much for a champion like Ryze, who likes to get CDR from other sources as well?TL;DR: Shift power away from Ult, reduce/move CDR to something else. Change him in a way ,that his old build paths are still viable and not wasting stats. Probably compensate with damage or utility.

What's that thing you know everything about, would go above and beyond for, have spent way to much time and/or money on, own signed first editions of, etc?I'll start: I'm obsessed with survival horror games – the Fatal Frame franchise in particular. I own all four games (yes, four. There's a fourth game out for the Wii – but only in Japanese. There's a homebrew patch available that lets you play in English, though. I'll shoot you a link if you want.) I've done a cosplay of one of the main characters, and am planning a second. Overall, I've spent more than $300 on these games – I once bought a new playstation 2 for $50 because one of the games spontaneously wouldn't run on my old one and buying a new one was cheaper than buying a new copy of the game.YOUR TURN, REDDIT.

I've been doing weekly 50-70% water changes. As stated above, I also added some Biomax filter media to help boost biofiltratrion about a week ago.

1sux49	-30545	1387013672	hearthstone	On the topic of abandoning daylie quests. [Math inside]	I just calculated the average gold you can get per day via daily quests:There are 25 different quests, 15 of them reward 40 Gold, 9 reward 60 Gold, and 1 rewards 100 Gold.That makes the average yield per day: 49.6 Gold.If your daily quest is a 40 Gold one, you can abandon it to get another one. I was informed that you can get a new quest from the whole pool, which makes it rewarding to cancel 40 Gold quests immediately.The chance not to get a 40 Gold quest after abandoning one is 10/24, so ~42%. The average yield of this new quest is 50 Gold.What I mean with average yield:     (1/25)*100G + (9/25)*60G + (15/25)*40G = 49.6G    (1/24)*100G + (9/24)*60G + (14/24)*40G = 50GThanks to /u/AwesomeDewey: The average yield if you abandon the first 40G-quest you get is    (1/25)*100g + (9/25)*60g + (15/25)*(1/24*100g + (9/24)*60g + (14/24)*40g)= 55.6g per day That's it, thanks for reading. Happy hearthing.

I've been playing Resonant Rise now for a while but wante to switch to FTB again, but I'm having extreme framerate-issues in the "bigger" FTB-packs.- Monster, DW20, TPPI all give me 1-2 fps.- Agrarian Skies runs fluently- Any pack I tried on ATLauncher runs perfect.So, what could be the problem here?

3agk6v	-30545	1434757752	hearthstone	Turn time has been reduced from 90 to 70 seconds. That's a huge change and nobody knows about it.	Thanks to /u/Geniii for pointing it out. I can't find any information on when this was changed.Stealth nerf to Patron warriors ‽Edit:**Official Reply by Mr. Ben "BenBrode" Brode himself**&gt;Howdy! The turn timer was 90 seconds in alpha, but we changed it to 75 seconds before we released the Beta, and haven't changed it since.There is also some amount of "slush time", basically extra time based on the amount of stuff your opponent did on their turn, so they can't queue a bunch of actions, end turn, and then have a lot of your turn eaten up by watching attacks and other spell effects.Our system doesn't (currently) care when during your turn those attacks occurred, so it sometimes feels like turns have varying length, depending on the number of actions your opponent took and when during the turn they happened.We've been cleaning up the "slush time" system so turns are more consistent, and that may be part of what you're experiencing.          Edit Edit: I'm sorry if this comes off as misinformation. By the time I was writing that, I was under the assumption that this was a new change. Turns out it wasn't. I can't edit the headline anymore. If you google "Hearthstone turn time", you'll find a lot of people (including Hearthstone.gamepedia until the making of my post) stating it's 90s.

So, I finally wanted to slightly automate my Essentia stuff. Nothing too fancy, definitely not something that Azanor would find horrible. But the problem is this: http://i.imgur.com/0KShM9E.png  (Edit: An even simpler setup http://i.imgur.com/cTCrivx.png still nothing moves.)(Edit2: Just to show that directional pipes do help. It's the void Jars that don't do their job. http://i.imgur.com/K6wvTko.png)If I understand the Thaumonomicon correctly, a labeled Void Jar should have a suction between a labeled and an unlabeled jar. Labeled have 63, unlabeled 31. So something like 47. The resonator shows 31.Even with restricted essentia pipes, I should be able to manipulate Essentia to flow into the void jar where it evaporates. But nothing happens. A full Void Jar does not suck up any Essentia at all. How do I fix this?Final Edit: Maybe that's exactly how azanor wanted it. I will try to use golems.

Day (0)	Anytime you saw me on the street for the past year and a half I've been high, didn't matter where I was going or what I was doing.  Before the job interview, date, family holiday meal. I mean I would have thought I would recognize how much I fucked myself if it's something I *need* before doing anything.  The twenty four hours or so every week I'm out of pot must be the only time I'm sober.  It's like I don't have a rational mind anymore with no appetite and I'm already underweight.  I get confusing nightmares and wake up heavy and sluggish.  No energy cause I don't take care of myself.  Man I've quit so many times throwing my weed in the toilet making up some self promise then only a few hours later regretting throwing it all away.  Call the dealer.  Re-up.  Call a buddy.  Go CSI in your room for micro crumbs of sweet sweet THC.  I'd give an OCD ent a run for his money, I don't want to go into that cause man that get's plain pathetic and depressing.I didn't even want to write this but look how many words I put down holy shit.  It's stupid how much I think about how it'll finally end, I've never truly wanted to stop but I **HAVE** too.  I need to be sharper, I can't dull my senses and remain ignoring the things that I *know* will help me.  I've been lurking here for so many months thinking of posting, reading all these other people who know what I'm talking about.  All those fucking memories of weed.  One and a half years high, four years of smoking really changes you.  I can't imagine who I could have been.  I still have some right now and your right I'm high too.  I wish I could wake up a different person and not just believe I can change but actively pursue it.

1m750g	-30586	1378929974	Amnesia	Where's the Lovecraft?	The Lovecraftian influence was one of my favorite things about the first Amnesia game, and it was basically nonexistent here. Was anyone else disappointed by that?Anyway, while I'm here, I might as well mention that I just beat the game. If you asked me to describe it as an experience, I would say it's a brilliantly written story created by a company who isn't quite sure how to make a game. The puzzles were simplistic, you can count the number of enemy encounters on your hands and still have fingers left, and there were maybe two enemy types in the whole game. It's probably worth mentioning that I scare *extremely* easily, and I was at no point during this game scared. The Dark Descent was full of scenes that were so damn terrifying that I had to quit the game and come back later because I simply wasn't able to handle them, and there were no scenes even remotely close to that here.Also, I was shocked by just how linear the game is. The Dark Descent gave you quite a bit of freedom in exploring the castle, and there were often multiple paths to take through areas. A Machine for Pigs was almost like a haunted house ride in that respect.All that said, the story was fantastic and it kept me interested until the very end.

I thought the season 5 finale was good, but I also felt afterwards like my reaction to it wasn't the kind I would have liked. I couldn't help but think back to season 1, when Ned Stark was beheaded, and to season 3's Red Wedding. The deaths in those episodes were very clear, and there was no ambiguity as to whether those characters were dead.In the season 5 finale, Stannis was theoretically beheaded, but it happened off-screen. I feel that the impact of this scene was lessened significantly by a number of things. For one thing, the entire battle was skipped, so we didn't get to see his actual defeat, nor did we witness whatever injury he suffered that left him sitting up against a tree. Also, he didn't get any cool last words, and then when Brienne swung the sword the scene cut away. My reaction wasn't shock or sadness, but rather a sort of reserved confusion.Jon's death was frustrating, because on one hand I don't expect him to stay dead, but on the other hand it wouldn't really surprise me if he actually did die. Obviously his story is very important and cutting it off halfway through would serve no logical narrative purpose, but at the same time this is also the season that gave us a pretty disappointing Stannis story arc and a completely pointless Dorne subplot.What did you guys think? I'm curious if anyone else found themselves reacting similarly to this episode's big "deaths."

2tazxe	-30599	1421946859	YouEnterADungeon	The British Are Coming!	It is the year 2020. The queen of England has declared the beginning of the new British Empire, and has begun taking territories with shocking speed. Much of Africa and southern Asia have fallen back under British rule. France, Germany, and Spain have collapsed, due to covert assassinations of leaders and generals. The United states is England's next target. Warships flying the union Jack have been spotted on the Atlantic, headed for the US. You are President Anderson's most trusted advisors, and are standing next to him in the oval office. He's been run ragged, ordering troops around and coming up with defensive plans. There is a knock on the door, and the president 's Secretary peeks inside.

The guilds have mostly closed their doors, and the remaining few are in a sorry state indeed. You are the youngest member of the Golden Wanderers, an old guild located in the town of Oatstock. Its once mighty members are now frail and grey. Its armory is full of rust, and the quest board has been empty for three years. You're going to change that. Your parents warned you against it, but the call of adventure was too great to resist. The stories from old man Hamish were too tempting. You will restore the guild to its former glory, you can feel it in your bones. Who are you? And how will you set out on this quest?

bzkmb	-30602	1272919088	AskReddit	Dear reddit, please help my best friend come closer to fulfilling his dream.	I wasn't exactly sure where to turn to for this issue, but I really couldn't think of any other place better to come to than reddit.My friend, Josh, is, to the fullest extent, head over heels enthusiastically crazy about drumming in the band or a drum corp.  It is ALL he talks about, all he does, all he thinks about. It is his true passion in life. He's been trying out for the Raider's Drum Corp. for quite some time now, constantly driving back and forth from PA to NJ for these long-hour practices nearly every weekend. His level of commitment truly baffles me; I rarely see people as committed to something as much as he is.After numerous practices and tryouts, and almost dropping out of the Corp. due to financial issues, he has made the 2010 bass line! However, this comes at a high cost. Totaling nearly $1200, it is quite a high cost to swallow.  I've seen how committed he is and how passionately he feels about this. This is truly his dream, one of his goals in life. Thus, as his friend, I really wanted to help him as much as I could possibly.This is where you can help him out. He is accepting donations to help him pay for the total cost. I've already donated $25 to him and I just would like the spread the word. Any amount of money really helps, whether its $1 or $10, anything helps. Even if you can't afford to donate him money, please just spread the word if you could. As his friend, I know how much this opportunity means to him and I'd really hate to see him lose it.Here is his facebook group he made where you can learn more about him, directly from his words:http://tinyurl.com/27po7jcThis is where the donations can be sent. If you decide to donate, just make it out to "Josh Crafts":http://www.raidersdbc.org/dues.htm

For the last couple of years, I've had engaging conversations with a very intelligent friend of mine. I always learn something new from him. Most of the time we discuss philosophical things such as the meaning of life, how our planet came about, what else is out there, other dimensions, etc. However, I want to learn more about these things without always going to ask him. Any suggested movies, articles, magazines, books that could help me? The few things I've tried to read were just so far beyond my level that I had trouble comprehending them, but I am really interested in learning more.I didn't know exactly what to title this as, but here are some topics we've spoken about so that you can get a better idea of what I'm interested in: * big bang theory* dark energy* one-electron universe* spatial dimensions* theoretical time travel and traveling through dimensionsThose are the ones that come to my head first. If I think of more, I'll post them.Thanks, reddit!

eau8m	-30602	1290560705	AskReddit	Dear Reddit, how would you explain to a non-redditor what reddit is?	I'm confronted with this situation many times, but I've yet to formulate a wholesome answer. Is it bacon? Topic-specific conversation? Narwhals? Jailbait? Imgur?What do/would you say if someone asks you "What is reddit"?
egoig	-30602	1291582500	badcompany2	Just bought BC2, haven't been this excited for a game in awhile!	I've had my eye on BC2 for the last few weeks, holding out for a $15 or less deal (I'm a tight-wad when it comes to buying games). Just stumbled upon this subreddit and read through for about an hour this morning... needless to say, I just purchased it through Steam for $20. After reading this subreddit, I couldn't help myself.I played BF2 a bit, so I'm aware of the BF style game play. I'm just excited to finally have a new FPS that isn't CoD! Oooohhh, tanks, helicopters, destroyable buildings, awesome!Also, looks like I'll have to OC my E8400 again. Seems that this game likes to eat CPUs. Man, it's been awhile since I OC'd. Oh well, back to 4ghz here I come!So, as a noobie to BC2, what do you guys have to say? I've read some of the previous tips and suggestions, but I'm always open to more. Or if you just want to say how much you love BC2, that's alright too :)
eoixr	-30602	1292807166	AskReddit	Are expensive dress suits that much different than "budget" dress suits?	Today I went with my dad to look for a suit. We stopped by Jos. A Banks and Brooks Brothers. I found a suit that looked quite nicely on me at Brooks Brothers, with a staggering price tag of $1,000. Afterwards, we went to Jos. A Banks and found another suit that I liked for $250. However, it made me look like an "unmade bed" according to my dad. I had to agree with him, I just didn't look as clean cut or polished with that suit on.I recently read something another redditor wrote on here about how much Chinese made sweaters and clothing are marked up, which brought me to this question. Are there valid, worthy differences between the cheaper and more expensive suits, or is it slight differences with a placebo effect going on? Maybe it's just because I'm not well informed enough, but I can't comprehend how a suite can cost over $1,000.
erv31	-30602	1293420083	badcompany2	Stats not saving?	Something funny has been going on lately...

f2j5f	-30602	1295048696	gaming	Reddit, what are some good space exploration/planet colonizing games for the PC?	Ever since I played the last stage of Spore in outerspace, I've been looking for a game like that. I really had a lot of fun just exploring different solar systems, finding new planets, and taking over the planets. Also, the inter-solar system economic trading was really fun for me. I've already looked at EVE but I'm not necessarily looking for an MMO, plus the learning curve was a bit steep for my likings.Are there any games like that part of spore that step it up a notch, in terms of depth?

f7qs3	-30602	1295826752	gaming	Morrowind: Worth playing to hold me over until Skyrim?	I bought Oblivion at launch and fell in love with the game. Loved the atmosphere, the story, the gameplay, the world, nearly everything. It had its cons, but excellent game. I've heard Morrowind is a fantastic game also, and it would be nice to learn more about the ES universe, but I haven't wanted to play it up until I saw the 2011 mod.Would it be worth grabbing the GOTY on steam and downloading one of the Morrowind 2011 torrents (or waiting until he re-releases it)? Part of the reason I haven't wanted to play it is because it is a bit aged for my tastes, but the 2011 mod made me interested.

m1hpx	-30602	1320510710	skyrim	I've read so many posts about it, but I'm still unsure how/if this character will work out?	So I'm indecisive and I like to do a bit of everything. I already know that I want to play a human character (I have some weird thing against not humans). I've sort of decided on a Nord already. Anything else just wouldn't feel right in my opinion. After all, when I'm plowing through the snow and mountains in Skyrim, I want to be a badass viking.Here's my issue. I like sword and shield play, and now with the welcoming of dual-wielding, I'll probably want to do a bit of that too. I've never liked using magic, but the destruction, which looks awesome, and healing are two I tend to use. I will dabble in and out of other magic as well. Lastly, I do also enjoy the sneaking/assassinating aspect of the game aka dark brotherhood.Is anything stopping me from being a warrior with mage and assassin qualities? I'm not one of those people than can just create a mage, or just an assassin. I want to be a jack of all (well some) trades.
mtc69	-30602	1322576340	skyrim	How does a GTX 260 216 handle Skyrim?	So I was going to upgrade my GPU for xmas, but money is getting a bit tight here... I'm playing at 1680 x 1050 on a Q9550 at 4ghz, so I assume that's fine.All I want to do is pull a solid 30+fps at Ultra. From what I've been reading, the 5770 can do that which is a bit of a slower card from what I'm aware of? My 260 is overclocked to 702/1440/1200 so it's a decent amount faster than stock.Just wondering, since I want to appreciate Skyrim with all of its awesomeness but I'd rather save the money :)Thanks!Btw. I can't test it since I won't be getting home for another few weeks from my study abroad.

I finally got home 2 days ago and began playing Skyrim. After reading so much on here, my thoughts were pretty much on par with what everyone else said.I walked around just admiring all of the small details. The flowers, butterflies, sounds, etc. But then... I was walking and saw a tree stump.... WITH FREAKING ANTS CRAWLING ON IT. Seriously? Bravo Bethesda! This is why I buy your games. You focus on nearly every single detail to make the world become alive!I know I'm a bit behind, but I just had to share my thoughts with you guys. Also, played for over 2 hours and I haven't even done the first quest in Whiterun yet... Eventually....

pjkam	-30602	1328894033	askscience	If, for example, a trumpet and a piano both play the same note, what makes the two notes sound entirely unique to each instrument?	I've been thinking about sounds a lot lately. How just different combinations of sound waves produce music, our voice, nature sounds, everything we hear in the world basically.Pardon me if it's a stupid question, but I don't know a ton about this subject matter. The question goes beyond just the instrument example. How can two sounds of the same exact thing (musical notes from different instruments is the strongest example I can think of) still sound entirely different, yet still work in harmony? What's going on way down there at the sound wave level? How does the combination of sound waves coming from speakers, at a single precisely given moment, make the sound which we interpret as music, or whatever else may be playing? I'm not exactly sure how to word it more clearly, as I'm having trouble verbalizing my thoughts.Thanks!

r5rlf	-30602	1332282147	atheism	/r/atheism, how can I become a well-informed, knowledgeable atheist and contribute to the atheism community?	I dropped my religion (Roman Catholicism) during 10th grade in high school after hours and hours of "debate" with my good atheist friend. I'm now a college freshman. My issue is this: If I'm debating with someone about religion, I always seem to run out of steam on my side of the argument. I am always open to new ideas and concepts, as I'm always looking for more and more support as to why I chose atheism, or rather, why religion is nonsense in my opinion.What are some ways I can keep myself informed and learn all sides of the arguments? Also, how I can I contribute to the community? I understand we can't change others against their own will, but I know for a fact that there are many atheists (or soon-to-be) out there who are either too afraid or too confused. If everyone saw this situation through our eyes, I think there would be a much higher percentage of non-believers.What do you say, /r/atheism, do you have any advice? Thanks a bunch!

It's almost instinctual; we see a cute animal and think "d'awwww, that's adorable".

Usage ramped up a bit over the months, starting experimenting with day time smoking. Here we are and by the end of summer, I'm rocking it ALL day. I mean, just because it was the end of summer, and what the hell. Might as well toke up!Now here at school, I've noticed that I'm able to talk to everyone. I feel like I can talk to anyone and everyone, and as if there's a positive energy being emitted everywhere around me. My anxiety (social and about academics) is also lowered a lot.But more importantly, I seemed to have overcome all of the social stereotypes that I followed in the past. Smoking with so many people over the summer, meeting interesting people, and learning more about even myself, I've come to be so much more accepting and understanding of everyone. I find that I don't judge as I used to, but rather, try to hear their story.Tolerance has risen as usual, and a tolerance break is in order. But what positive effects mary has left with me, I couldn't be happier about.tl;dr Goldfish grahams (vanilla cupcake) dipped in honey are really really delicious

I just swapped the SIM from my One XL over to the Nexus 4. Phone calls work, texts work, data does work, MMS doesn't work, and data speeds are very slow.I'm unable to get anything faster than 0.5Mbps down while I used to be getting around 3Mbps on my One X. Further, AT&amp;T said they cannot help me since it is not an AT&amp;T supported phone (as if I expected much help from them anyway).I've read all the other posts and tried the different APNs, but my speed still seems to be throttled. Where do I go from here?EDIT: The second set of APN settings is the one I'm currently using. http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1851128EDIT2: So I just put the SIM card back in my One XL... also getting very slow speeds, much slower than I usually get.

I had a nice suction horizontal dock that toss the phone into dock mode automatically. I had an AUX cable hidden in the dash and plugged that in and the dock was plugged in all the time to a hidden micro USB.Now with the Nexus 4, I'm back to square one. Is there some sort of device that I could use bluetooth to create a wireless ( via bluetooth) AUX connection? Furthermore, what's the word out on car docks for our phones? Between a potential wireless AUX connection and some NFC tags, this would work out quite well.Edit: For reference, I have an '09 Impreza with the stock head unit.

1ak0ea	-30602	1363647824	subaru	Thoughts on upgrading to a turbo Subaru?	This is something that's been on my mind, on and off, for the past year. I'm currently driving an 09 2.5i and I really love her. She's beautiful, drives well, handles great, spacious, and has a mean rumble. I've made her into almost exactly what I wanted over the past couple years. For reference:http://www.flickr.com/photos/mloiacono/7498270788/in/set-72157627417495889http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApF31jsh36o&amp;list=UUSejFnyaOIqkbEEcuAtx-2w&amp;index=3 (exhaust sound clip)Lately I've been riving my brothers Evo IX (310awhp currently) which has REALLY gotten me itching for some forced induction. However, I don't have a lot of money nor do I want to really lose the reliability of an n/a Subaru. The only reasonable thing I'd be able to do is sell my car and buy another car with that money +~$1000. I'd consider a WRX, but there's no way I can afford the insurance, and the same goes for an STI. The only real choices I'm left with are the LGT and an FXT. Not a big fan of how the FXT's look, which leaves me with only a LGT as an option (preferably a Spec B if possible). The insurance isn't much more, so that wouldn't be a problem in this case.However, I fear going from being the first owner of a nice, reliable 2009 2.5i to a used 08 (give or take a year) LGT with one or more owners. Plus my car only has a bit over 20k on the clock, so it's still in pretty nice condition. In my mind it seems justified to sell my car for a turbo model, but I'm not sure how I feel about selling a new car (me being the first owner) for a used car that I'll never know how it was truly treated.Is there any feasible way I can cure my itch for speed? The way I see it, I'm stuck (well not stuck, I still love my car) with the 2.5i for another few years until I'm in grad/med school or somewhere along those lines, but I'm always looking for another option.tl;dr Getting the turbo itch but not sure if it is really a feasible plan.edit. holy wall of text, sorry about that. tend to be a bit long winded sometimes :p

1fzn0m	-30602	1370798463	SuggestALaptop	Trying to find a laptop for primarily photo-editing and occasional gaming - around $1500	I currently have the Dell XPS 15 L502X. Fantastic screen, fast, but it is quite large, heavy, and I've already had two motherboard replacements in the past 6 months (under warranty, luckily). So, I'm looking to upgrade but without losing the screen quality for photo work and without losing too much performance.* Country of purchase: USA * Budget range: Around $1500... not much more * Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): Primarily my laptop for school, photo editing, some light video editing, and occasional gaming (at least equal to my current XPS with GT525M) * Screen size preference: 13"-15" * OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): Windows * Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): Around medium settings on Far Cry 3 with about 30-40fps would be OK. * Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.): Preferably a quad core i7, a dedicated video card (especially since photoshop and Premiere can use it) * Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support): self-support, but I want a good warranty service to cover the potential expenses for repair * Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, businesscompatibility): Dell service has been good... but needing two mother boards has not been. Bad experiences with HP in the past. * Any particular style that you like (examples are great): I want it to be more sleek and solid feeling than the L502X. As close to the quality of a MBP as possible, preferably. Similar to the new XPS's?  * Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced) * Long battery life -vs- Low weight: Middle * Build quality -vs- Low price: Build quality * Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: Performance **Would you pay a premium for something that has:** * High resolution screen: Yes * A great keyboard: For a lit keyboard, yes * A great touchpad/mouse buttons: As long as it's usable, it's fine. Usually use a mouse * Great audio: Coming from the L502X... preferably decent speakers **List any features that are critical:** (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, matte screen, etc.) USB 3, COLOR ACCURATE SCREEN (I can calibrate it, if need be), HDMI.---------------------------I looked into the new XPS which seems almost perfect save for the fact that the screen is a downgrade from the L502x and it seems to be plagued with WiFi issues. My ideal laptop would be almost like a MBPr 13/15, Windows 7, and not the hefty price tag... I realize something has to give though.Thanks in advance!

Never had any problems but the past couple weeks I've noticed that it seems to think headphones are plugged in. I downloaded an app called Soundabout which disables the auto-selection for headphones and then I can manually decide which to use. However, this is only a work around, not a fix.Also, if I open up Chrome and click in the URL bar or the search bar on the home screen at the launcher, within about 5 seconds or so, it will bring up voice search as if I said "Google" or clicked the button.I'm gonna go and guess this is a broken aux jack. Is this easily replaceable? Or should I seek warranty repair? Any other ideas?

If I move the mouse (nearly) perfectly to the left or right, it will hop up and down a few pixels and the movement does not 1:1 correlate with my physical movement of the moues. It's become a major annoyance. I've tried uninstalling the driver and different USB ports, but no help. Has anyone heard of this issue?

I have a raise bed where I plant all of my tomatoes, beans, lettuce... etc. But I have mounds that are unprotected for all of my pumpkins, zucchini, cucumbers, squash... etc. The turkeys like to go on the mounds and roost, or whatever you call it when they lay in the dirt and rustle around. The plants are small so they keep pulling them up when they go in the dirt.I don't have the time/money to build a fence. What other options do I have? Thanks for your help and suggestions.
1liwvw	-30607	1378056112	cancer	Not sure about my nut	Hi. I just noticed a lump on my right nut about the size of a small pea. I feel like there is a dull ache there after I look at it, but not sure if that is me just being a hypochondriac. I'm kinda in this weird state of wonder whether it is testicular cancer or just a part of my nut, I can't find a similar mark on my left one. Is there anything reliable to check myself?I've been trying to find pictures of people with tc but can't really find anything besides diagrams. Does posting a pic help?UPDATE:Not sure if anyone cares but, went to the doctor and turns out it was an inflamed epididimys. You can tell because it is not securely attached to the testicle, cancer is on there tight. Probably caused from not having tighter support when playing sports. Got some antibiotics and should be good in a few days.

The trick is I don't want to travel away from my family in order to be at the client site 4 days a week. So, instead of flying Mon-Thur every week, I want my wife and 1 year old to move with me from contract to contract. Contracts can be anywhere from 3 months to a year. It might be a cool way for us to live in different parts of the US we would not have normally.We just bought a house and intend to keep it as a sort of "home base." We don't want to lug around our furniture and have to do big moves every 6 months or so.Any ways, I was wondering if there are any other ideas, considerations, or things I may be overlooking to making this transition. Has anyone done this before? Please let me know if you need anything clarified.

t2tlm	-30617	1335934290	blackops2	Black Ops 2 DLC coming to PS3 first?	"Have you seen the new Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 Reveal Trailer yet? Release date confirmed: 11.13.12" -Playstation Facebook PostNow, you don't usually see Playstation posting on Facebook about a game that isn't developed by them or is sponsored by them... but they posted about Black Ops 2 and that is what makes me suspicious. As seen by this document(http://investor.activision.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=479305) on the official Activision website, it says that Microsoft has a deal with Activision that Xbox 360 gets the CoD DLCs before anyone else. But you also notice that that contract with Microsoft EXPIRES IN 2012! Black Ops 2 comes out in 2012, and the DLC won't get released until January. So unless Microsoft renews the contract, expect to see DLC on the Playstation 3 first if Sony makes a move. However, if they don't make a move, I predict that Activision will go about distributing the DLC through Call of Duty Elite. I know that it already is, but I mean, if you payed, no matter what system, you get the DLC first. Anyways, those are my thoughts.

The operating system is the most up to date version of OS X Lion and has a 1.86 GHz processor speed with the Intel Core 2 Duo processor. ConditionSince the day the computer came out of the box, it has been protected with a maximum coverage Zagg shield. These are made out of top-notch, military grade material that could withstand a Dremel tool! The Zagg shield covers the ENTIRE computer, minus the screen, so the computer looks and feels like its right out of the box. Everything is in-tact, the keyboard functions perfectly, the screen is perfect, and the computer works like new overall. The battery life has slightly depleted, as expected for a computer like this, but it still holds a charge of a little over 6 hours! When it came out of the box it held the projected 7 hour battery life. The exterior of the computer is in great condition because of the Zagg shield, and there are NO dents, scratches, or scuffs. All the ports work fine (2 USB's, headphone port, SD card slot, Mini-Display port). The advantage of having this computer over the 11 inch Macbook Air is that its faster and it also has a SD card slot for your camera and for external storage if you want.All in all, this computer is near brand new!

Please change your password immediately and post your in-game name in the comments section below.Brought to you by staff who have been running large servers for months, ba55ment is a wonderful server where both novices and experienced players can play, create awesome buildings, and get along. The server has only been up a short time, and has already started to fill with many wonderful buildings!join our facebook group for the fastest updates on server info and events, as well as general socialising! http://www.facebook.com/faradormc Livemap here!  http://www.ba55ment.org:8123/ Website here!  http://ba55ment.org/ Large Imgur gallery!  http://imgur.com/a/3BixN#0 Please use the Facebook page for unban requests, at least until we have a more permanent solution.-------------------------------------------------------The server has two maps available to build in right from the start; Plotworld, and Vanilla. We feel that these two maps together should cater for most people's building needs up to the time when they are promoted to Trusted rank. At this point they are allowed to build in huge freebuild maps with awesome custom terrain. While default players are not permitted to build in any other world except the plot world, you are always welcome to view all of the other worlds and hopefully acquire some inspiration from the amazing builds inside them. We promote people based on their creative and communicative skills; we will not give promotions to those who ask, as you must earn them.We are not an elitist server, ba55ment will not judge you based on your age or your building skills, our main goals is to allow as many players as possible to have fun. Founded by respected mau5ville players, ba55ment is officially mau5villes temporary replacement, as mau5ville is indefinitely down.-------------------------------------------------------Like all servers, we have a unique set of rules that all of our players are required to follow. These can be found in-game and on our website, and they must be read in order to be able to build in plots. We do not accept griefing in any world on any build other than your own, except in the vanilla world. As we are monitoring the actions of every player, any grief found will result in an instant ban. Spamming is not tolerated, and will result in an automatic kick.------------------------------------------------------- We thank you all for taking the time to visit ba55ment, and hope you stay for a long time, we don't plan on taking this server down any time soon!PS: If your framerate drops as you spawn, be aware that this is entirely down to your PC, and nothing to do with the server itself. We believe it has something to do with lighting bugs in The End.Additional Detailsba55ment is a wondrous and magnificent server filled with awesome builds created by the greatest builders minecraft has ever known. We aim to find builders with incredible imagination and creativity.

Can any of you tell me the name of the song at 0:54 in the video? If you can remind me of the name, YOU ARE A BEAST! http://youtu.be/eTE0838kl98?t=54s

It still shows it, even though I have deleted the app in the Applications folder AND in Applications Support folder. I can search in finder in "This Mac" and "All my files" and nothing comes up. Yet in Launchpad I still have the ability for me to open and use the application, and it HAS to be running off of *something*.TLDR; I deleted all data in the "Applications Folder" and in "Applications Support" for an app, yet it still shows up and launches fine in dashboard. **I want to get rid of the app.**

In light of the recent [iCloud user getting hacked](http://gizmodo.com/5931828/how-gizmodo-got-hacked-and-how-you-should-defend-yourself) and thus all his devices being wiped, people should re-think their current password on iCloud and on other sites. But there's a few problems: You don't trust online password generators or you don't want to pay for a password managing program. That is no longer a problem! **OS X has a BUILT IN completely random password generator!!** And here's how to access it: * 1) Go into finder and search "Keychain Access"* 2) Open the program, and if necessary click the lock in the upper left hand corner and enter your system password to access the application* 3) Now that you can fully access the application, on the bottom of the window click on the little "+" symbol* 4) Now in the window it created, next to the "Password" box, click on the image of the key * 5) And there you go!

Also I plan on keeping this laptop for a while so I will probably use Windows for other things along the way. But I have a few questions: * 1) I've heard from reviews that when you run windows on it, the computer gets really hot. Is this something I need to worry about if I keep the computer on my desk?* 2) Do the specs of the computer determine the performance of using Boot Camp? I have the base model Retina MacBook Pro but with 16GB of RAM.* 3) Could you upgrade to Windows 8 via Windows 7 ON the MacBook?* 4) Should I wait to boot camp the MacBook and get Windows 8?* 5) How do you switch operating systems? (ex. You're on your mac desktop and then you want to switch to Windows)* 6) Any other things I should worry about/know when dual-booting w/ boot camp?Thank you!**Edit**: Another question: How much should I partition If I am going to be using it for SOME games and other programs. From previous experience most say 50GB. What does r/Apple think?

I'm getting tired of people just posting pictures of something they got in a chest or as a drop of a boss. We get it: you found an awesome gun, but does that *actually* have anything else to it other than what the gun does? I can understand people posting pictures of crazy things people do with guns, or funnily named guns, but don't just post a picture, that looks like you took the picture with a potato, of a chest that has a legendary gun in it. If new guns are added in DLC, fine, post pictures. Thats cool because people are discovering new guns and their features. Special mission weapons? Okay. But when people spam pictures of random legendary guns it gets annoying, so can we please stop?-The r/Borderlands2 community.

Before, cheats were all about fun, like spawning tanks and planes and having pedestrians riot. Stuff like that is hilarious and fun because it adds stuff that makes the game entertaining. In GTA IV it was all about usefullness, and in my opinion, cheats should be the opposite of that. What kind of cheats do you think GTA V will have other than the normal wanted up, wanted down, weapon sets, etc?

So far we have played on it every single day and have [beaten the ender dragon](http://i.imgur.com/uealAH2.png), [built the empire state building](http://i.imgur.com/0GLDbXv.png), and have gotten [full enchanted diamond armor](http://imgur.com/a/3rjm4),[ tools, and bows.](http://imgur.com/a/CInA1) We have built successful mob farms and have found villages, desert temples, and jungle temples.

1gpid4	-30617	1371703291	battlefield_4	Will the BF4 VOIP system actually work on console this time? On PS3 the VOIP muting system was TRASH!	I don't know how it is on the Xbox 360 or PC, but on PS3 the muting system was TRASH. If you tried individually muting people, it just flat out didn't work. It would show the symbol but they would still be talking. Also, when you set the VOIP to squad only you would randomly hear snippets of people from other squads. The only thing that actually worked about the VOIP system was when you set it to "none" which disabled ALL VOIP.I REALLY want a revamp of this system in BF4 because in BF3 it gets REALLY annoying when I can't mute someone when its just static or random shit going on in their mic.

I KNOW this isn't the right place to post, but it only seems relevant because as it seems the PS4 no longer includes component cables.I have a monitor, which I plug the HDMI cable from my PS3 into, and then for audio I have some contraption that looks the red and white component cables feed into then a gold piece that I plug the speakers into, in order for me to get audio through my speakers, not my monitor.And since the PS4 doesn't have component cables I can no longer use this setup, so i'm wondering how I can get audio playing through my speakers with just HDMI since my monitor doesn't have speakers.Again, sorry if this is the wrong sub, I don't know if any of you can help me out but that'd be great.Edit: This is my setup with the speakers and component cable thingy http://i.imgur.com/1Za62RR.jpg

We built a cobblestone generator, layed out chests and furnaces, looted all the islands for ores and items, made a wheat and tree farm, and built a full size house. The house was complete with a kitchen, dining area, chest area, spiral staircase, bedroom, paintings, and windows. We did all of this in 4 hours, and we basically turned this Skywars map into our own survival world.Also, Woody, you should probably put a time limit on Skywars so people can't do this :)And if you wanna give us some in-game money for how cool this is our Minecraft usernames are ThatMinerOnline and Grosskem.

2ajgy7	-30617	1405202971	TheCreatures	You might not know most of these people, but there's a couple in here you might recognize... (x-post /r/PKA)	
2ajsov	-30617	1405211665	PKA	Thought I'd explain what "furry" is, especially after the convo in the latest PKA	When they were discussing the furry guest they had on a few PKAs ago they all acted like "furry" itself was a fetish with mascot costumes. What it is really is just a fandom much like any other fandom, where everyone has a common interest in something. For the furry fandom the case is everyone has a common interest in anthropomorphic animals (animals that have human qualities). People create art, go to conventions, and in general just have a good time and everyone is super friendly. Sex isn't the entire fandom. Those mascot costumes are called Fursuits in the fandom and 98% of the time aren't for sex. Being a furry doesn't mean you have some sick hentai animal fetish, it just means you have an interest in anthro animals. There still is another side of the fandom though that has an interest in furry porn (its called "yiff"), but that isn't NEARLY the whole fandom.Sorry if this sounds like I'm butthurt over this but I thought I'd just go and explain the furry fandom flat out so it doesn't continue to get a bad rap of being just one big fetish.

Well, now that my Nexus 4 is crapping out slowly, I'd like to get an iPhone, but I have a couple questions.1) Say if I go and buy a Verizon iPhone 5s at an Apple store (more than likely I'd wait for the next iPhone though), do I have to do anything with Verizon, or can I just get straight to business?2) I'm currently with T-Mobile on a $30/mo 100 min, unlimited text, unlimited data. Will I be able to keep this current plan with T-Mobile and be able to use their 4G LTE on my "Verizon" iPhone?3) If I wanted to go about ordering the iPhone online, how would I be able to bypass the Verizon registration stuff?4) Is there anything else I need to know that I'm missing, or is the Verizon iPhone REALLY unlocked?

2yb2xb	-30617	1425787561	TheCreatures	[MOD POST] New Rule Introduction - All social media image posts must be linked directly to the original post.	&gt; Rule #6: All image posts coming from a Creature's Twitter, Instagram, etc. must be a direct link to the post in question. Feel free to link an Imgur mirror in the comments.We believe this new rule will be a welcomed addition to the subreddit. It aims to not only eliminate confusion as to the original source of the image, but also allows for the original poster of the Tweet, Instagram, etc. to have their own words expressed in the post, rather than a potentially editorialized title.When a Tweet’s link is directly submitted, /u/TweetPoster will automatically post a copy of the Tweet in the comments, and will also provide an Imgur mirror of any images in the Tweet. Otherwise, feel free to include an Imgur mirror of the post in the comments if it is a picture on Instagram, for example.Thank you for your cooperation!EDIT: Along with this new rule, we have implemented [a new Wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheCreatures/wiki/ruleexpansion) that expands-upon each rule, and will hopefully answer any questions you have on what posts classify as "rule-breaking."

3432fb	-30617	1430174117	TheCreatures	[MOD POST] If you are going to post a CreatureHub video that the bot has failed to post, IT MUST BE IN A TEXT POST.	You may have noticed lately that there have been issues with the CreatureHub video-posting bot, /u/CreBot. To learn about the *why* of these issues, please see [this post here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheCreatures/comments/33ame1/bot_issues/)With that, we request that **if you are going to post a CreatureHub video that the bot has failed to post, IT MUST BE IN A TEXT POST.** This is to prevent further issues with the bot, "as duplicate link posts can confuse the bot."Also, keep in mind that **the rule "Please do not post new hub videos unless the bot has failed to do so after an hour" is still in place**, since the bot may still post videos, even though it is hit-or-miss.All link posts to videos other than those from TheCreatureHub will remain unaffected, but in the meantime while the bot's API is updated, all TheCreatureHub video posts from users must be text posts.Thank you for your cooperation.~ /r/TheCreatures mod team

We would like you to please keep in mind that these comments are in the minority, and you do not see as much appreciation from the other 1 million+ fans of The Creatures because they simply watch and enjoy.* **The concept of the liking the “old Creatures” more:**From James (Nova) himself: &gt; There is a reason this group is still around while others formed and fell out, there is a reason why we still have this following. If we stayed in 2011 mode, half of the group probably wouldn't even be making videos right now. I hate that no one can see that. Like 90% of the COD players that were HUGE back when we started, where are most now? They didn't evolve or anything so they kinda faded away. Everyone grows and learns new things. Evolving with a platform like YouTube that's changing all the time is something you MUST do (without losing yourself, of course).  *[Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheCreatures/comments/2ui0d2/never_have_i_wished_to_turn_off_comments_more/co8mquz)*#The Site Forums* Another recent topic of discussion is the website, mainly the site forums. The criticism we have been seeing lately is about atmosphere and the general format of the forums.*  **If you have problems with the forums, the subreddit isn’t the place to post about it.** If you have a suggestion for how the forum can be improved, post a topic in the [Suggestions Subforum](http://thecreaturehub.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=33), and we (the mod team and Aron) will take it into consideration. Aron has been very helpful so far and has already made some nice improvements to the forum.* Regarding the format, there’s not much to say about it. That’s just the style they are, and if that’s not your cup of tea, there are alternatives! That’s the beauty of alternative &amp;amp; smaller Creature sub communities like the subreddit! In the end what it really comes down to is personal preference for community size &amp;amp; site interface. This is why there is still a large number of people who frequent the subreddit over the forums, **because they simply prefer the general Reddit format over the classic forum style.*** Also, even with the site's launch, **James, Joe, and others still frequent the sub to keep everyone in the loop &amp;amp; check for content from our weekly threads to use on the Hub.** Obviously with their site being fairly new still, they'd want to direct traffic to there as the official site for The Creatures. But as evidence from James [\("It may not be what you want there, but there are many outlets now, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, and the site all get checked, and suggestions do make it through into the content."\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheCreatures/comments/35hak8/am_i_the_only_one_tired_of_all_the_hub_videos/cr4rfhx) and from Joe, [\("If I see any other good ones on Reddit, Twitter, or Facebook I'll take them too..."\)](http://i.imgur.com/GfbsCPn.png), the subreddit's content even with the forums is still doing just fine.#Questions on channel's series progress* Last but not least, **we will be adding to the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheCreatures/wiki/faq) and removing any new posts about questions on where a certain series has gone, unless it has not been addressed in the past.** We've found that these common topics do nothing but incite other complaints and the flood of arguing that ensues in the comments does not make the subreddit a welcoming place.***#### Thank you for your cooperation and we hope to continue to see you all around the subreddit! :)

3arik2	-30617	1435012902	TheCreatures	[MOD POST] Do NOT post Creature Hub videos until an hour after the bot has failed to do so, and if/when you do, it MUST BE IN A TEXT POST.	We've been seeing A LOT of this recently, and it is directly against the rules of our subreddit.Firstly, do NOT post Creature Hub videos **until an hour after** the bot has failed to do so. This is the first thing people are forgetting. We've been seeing CreatureHub videos being posted 5 min after they've been posted. **We have a bot for a reason, give it a chance!**Second, if/when you do post a Creature Hub video that the bot has missed, it **MUST BE IN A TEXT POST.** These duplicate link posts confuse the bot and cause it to break.PLEASE let the bot do its job and do *your* job as a member of our community by following these already established rules.**If you see any posts that are breaking these rules, please report them and we will take care of it ASAP**Thank you for your cooperation.~ /r/TheCreatures mod team**EDIT:** In response to all those questioning the point of the bot if it doesn't post for an hour, best explained by /u/MadeofBread: &gt; It wasn't working because people kept posting the links a couple minutes after it was published so the bot got confused. And it posted today's video just fine when people stopped doing that.It doesn't *actually* take an hour for the bot to post the video, that's just the leeway period for the bot to post it in case YouTube has publishing issues or anything like that. Usually it takes 5-10 min for it to post the video.EDIT 2: You will receive a temporary 24 hour ban if you post a Creature Hub video within 30 min of its upload.

3bmovh	-30617	1435671400	TheCreatures	On the Intern Joe and Spencer "criticism" -- From Nova's POV	This topic was originally brought up a few days ago, and immediately in response, James (Nova) laid out a solid, level-headed way to look at it. Please take the time to read through this, as any other blatant "hate"/unwarranted criticism **that has been addressed already within this post and the others** will be removed to avoid any further drama (Meaning, **if you have a new perspective to things you would like to add, go for it. But if you're just adding to the already established comments, please keep the discussion surrounding that in the original post in which it was already made.**) Thank you. &gt; I think people are a bit hard on these guys all things considering. I feel like everyone in the group, hell every youtuber in general was probably cringy as shit out of the gate, obviously over time you just kinda develop and learn what to do and what not to do. They simply need time to learn what some take years to learn, at least they are indeed learning as they go, not to say you NEED to accept it. Coming in as a "newbie" in front of a massive audience is pretty tough (Joe came in and did an Assassins Creed livestream like right away in CA and Spencer was on the big charity stream, both pretty big things), i feel like when they have the appropriate direction from one of us it works out. Its just when they are solo it can feel a bit forced, cause they are still learning what they need to do. I feel over time it'll mature, just like the rest of us did.&gt; ... im not saying its not warranted, criticism is good and will help them learn. Its just giving them that time to do so i guess.*[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCreatures/comments/3awmp2/unpopular_opinion_intern_joe_and_spencer_try_too/cshhnfp)*

3iec1d	-30617	1440545045	TheCreatures	An Update from the Mod Team	Recently in a State of the Subreddit, we revised our current set of rules in an attempt to move towards our newfound goal of making the subreddit a more positive and welcoming place; wanting to make it a place where The Creatures would *want* to interact with fans. The result, however, was anything but. We quickly realized that this new set of rules was not as fair as we had originally planned, and that blanketing everything under "moderator discretion" was clearly not the right approach. To start off, [a message from Aron](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCreatures/comments/3i9qw7/current_state_of_the_reddit_aka_im_taking_a_break/cueo8bf):&gt; First of all, Joe does not hate the Creatures Reddit community, the quote was just taken out of context and just a big misunderstanding. Joe does not see the point in doing an AMA mainly because he already answers all sorts of questions on Twitter. He does not like Reddit as a whole because of how it works and just prefers other social media.---I think we can all agree that some of the removed posts were not fully justified, and we are at fault for not justifying the removal in the comments. Bad communication doesn't help anybody, and that's exactly what happened here.**We want to address some of your main concerns:**&gt; I recently made a couple posts replying to others discussing a deleted post by a mod. I don't recall what the first poster said word for word, but I do know it wasn't anything harshly negative about the creatures/employees.-/u/TimeWastersTVIn an attempt to create a positive environment, we made a new rule stating “no complaining.” **This was an obvious wrong move, because this rule also encompasses the removal of real concerns from the community. Many of these genuine criticisms were wrongfully removed.**&gt; All im saying is that there is a lot of rude, stupid shit posted in this sub. Without being able to downvote it it will only shed more light on it.-/u/BearticBeastWe originally decided on the removal of the downvote because the downvote is in and of itself negative, which was going against our goal of making the community more positive. As time went on, we agreed that posts were the main subject of unnecessary downvotes (since this controls what content is seen on the front page), rather than comments. **Some comments which are downvoted do not necessarily need to be removed.** With that, we will be enabling downvotes for comments, but keeping it as-is for posts and seeing how it goes from here.___####As moderators, we are here to make the subreddit a welcoming platform for Creatures and Creature fans alike to discuss, post and create. ####We’re not here to control your opinions, we’re here to create a platform for your opinions to be heard and discussed. We want *your* content to be the center of attention, without any such fear that it could be removed due to overly vague rules.####In the future, before any major decisions are made we will consult with ALL other mods to ensure that no one opinion gets more influence over the other, ultimately resulting in a much more fair and understanding environment. We’re a mod *team* for a reason, and we want to make sure of that.___If there are other concerns not addressed here, please bring them to our attention at this time, and we will do our best to rectify the situation.Thank you for all of your understanding, and we hope to continue towards a more welcoming environment by creating an open platform for all of you to express your thoughts, opinions, and content.~ /r/TheCreatures Mod Team

If a same sex couple copulates, they cannot reproduce, taking that many more of the species out of the equation. Homosexuality is natures way of saying "You're getting out of hand, calm the hell down."It's just something I thought; don't know if it's scientifically provable, though.

11w444	-30620	1350907493	Assistance	Need only $1,000 - $1,500 dollars to get out of my situation. Me, my fiance, and 1 year old child need it.	Me, my fiance, and my son are living in a pretty bad situation. We're paying almost $1,000 dollars a month to live in a quarter of a two-car garage, which we can only sleep in, as it get's nearly 100 degrees in there during the daytime. Another two people will be moving in, meaning there will be seven people living in a two-car garage.Additionally, the house we're in is not healthy. There is black mold everywhere, it has a lot of problems - the cupboards constantly breaking, ceiling leaking, and the walls being very brittle - and is infested with spiders. To make matters worse, we are living with 23 cats, about 12 of them kittens. My 1 year old son constantly sick all the time, coughing, diarrhea, throwing up. My fiancee is covered in spider bites, and I myself have a rash that just won't go away.We've tried going to other services; CALworks and the like. However, I am still considered a part of my mother's household, as I live in her house, even though I am 18. My fiancee cannot earn enough to strike out on her own. I get over 600 a month in Social Security, due to my PTSD, but my mom is my payee, and she only gives me 100 out of it, taking the rest for rent and the like. Me and my girlfriend, every month, only have about 30 dollars to spend at the end of every month, after paying for essentials. This includes necessary stuff for my 13 year old brother - shampoo, soap, deodorant - as my mother won't do it.All we need is enough money to start out. If I can get out of my mom's house, and my fiance as well, we will earn more in Social Security, which will mean we will be able to support ourselves, as well as pay for schooling for us, so we can get jobs (we dropped out of high school to take care of our son). We only need around $1,000 dollars to pay the down payment and first months rent, (which will be approximately 700, closer to 750) and then the rest left over for essential house supplies, some pots and pans, food, utensils. I realize that my request is a bit pricey, but any less and we can't do it. Any help is appreciated. Every day we are scolded, yelled at, and treated like secondhand citizens. I scour the house every night, to keep it clean, and yet am treated like I don't do anything. I've tried everything I can ... but I just can't seem to do anything. Nobody else wants to help, and I just can't take it any more. My fiancee is at her wit's end. If she lives here any longer, she's going to leave, and I couldn't handle that. She's my life. I wouldn't be able to keep going on without her. tl;dr: living in a bad situation, unhealthy house, abusive, manipulative parents/landlords, need money to leave with my young son and fiancee.I live in Visalia, California. Any help would be greatly appreciated. If needed, I can agree on a loan. 
1226mz	-30620	1351163796	questionablecontent	QC is like a drug for me.	I'm not even kidding. I mean, I just finished from comic 1 all the way to the newest, and I find myself craving more, more, more! I can't stop thinking about it! QC is seriously the most entertaining thing I have ever read! Flawlessly blending comedy, romance, and drama, it leaves me craving more even after I've read over 2,300 pages of it! **Spoiler Alert**And the way the break up with Marten and Dora went! Oh, man! I seriously cried, and I haven't cried for nigh on ten years. The whole love triangle thing going on pulls at my heart strings so much! When they broke up, it made *me* feel depressed! It was like watching two dear friends break up. It was just totally out of left field!And then Dora and Tai got together. And Faye's with Wil. Poor Marten.Sorry for the incoherency. Halfway through writing this, I accidentally skipped back to the panel where Dora and Marten broke up, started crying again. God fucking dammit.

18vpz2	-30620	1361358665	fairytail	I recently got into Fairy Tail, but ...	As stated in the title, I recently started watching Fairy Tail after joining a roleplay site run by a friend; I needed to watch it so that I could get the site. I had always heard good things about, so I did so. In the last couple of days, I watched up to and past episode 30. I am currently on episode 33, iirc.Now, this is where I get to the "but ..." In those thirty episodes, it seems to me that they use the Worf Effect via Erza far too much. Erza is an S-rank Mage; she has been stated several times to be one of the most powerful members of the guild, and to be an incredibly capable fighter and planner. Yet she get's defeated and captured so easily! I love Erza as a character; unlike most "strong female leads", she's still a woman. She's not a man trapped in a woman's body.My point is, this has annoyed me. I'm not saying I want all characters to be infallible; but it just seems that Erza is defeated more than she wins. I don't like this. I'm not sure if it changes later in the series, but it's just something that irked me that I wanted to get off my chest. Sincerely,~dannywarbucksP.S. Jarvia. How cute is she~

19v1sp	-30620	1362684686	techsupport	Problem with my speakers?	Yes, I've checked to make sure everything is plugged in, and no, it's not my soundcard (I think, as headphones work just fine). A few months ago, me and my elder brother got into a fight, and the front casing of my speakers cracked and fell off. Since then, I'd have to occasionally mess with the exposed wires to get sound, but it was never a big deal.Well, I recently got a virus or something that made me have to reinstall my OS. My speakers haven't worked since then. I thought it was a problem with my drivers, but headphones work just fine. And I know power is going to the speakers, as whenever I touch the motherboard in a certain spot, it starts to hum. I'm not tech-savvy at all, so I have no idea how to fix it. I'm not sure what brand of speaker it is, nor where to find it, but on the back it says, on a white sticker with blue letters, "110V". Thanks for your help in advance. ^^

2svv9n	-30620	1421629242	Assistance	My family will be homeless soon. I need help.	Me and my family moved to LA two weeks ago. Since then, we've been living in an extended stay hotel, which is 258 a week. We've only been surviving as long as we did on the few Craig's list ad's my girlfriend has been answering. But this week, we have nothing. We have dollars to our name, almost no food, and rent due tomorrow. I called 211, but there was nothing they could do. They can only give a referral to LA Family Housing if we're actually homeless. I'm going to call back tomorrow, but it'll be at least a week before they can help is. All of the shelters can't help, because they require a referral from Welfare or similar, which we can't get. We got Welfare before we moved, and they won't switch the accounts until February. I've exhausted our options.I'm not asking for money. I know that times are hard. I just need help. A way to not be homeless, or even a place to sleep on the streets without having to worry about being homeless. I have two small kids, and my girlfriend can't take care of them by herself. Edit: I'm on mobile. I don't know how to add tags or check to see if my verification has come in. I'm sorry if I broke the rules.

2wuxro	-30620	1424686966	satanism	My girlfriend is a Satanist, and she is starting to convince me.	Hi all. So, about six months ago, my girlfriend converted to Satanism. Before that, we were depressed, unhealthy, just pathetic people. I don't want this to sound like a sermon, but ever since she's converted, things have just been going ... right.We get these feelings, these urges to do what a voice tells us is right. It's just a little nudge, pointing us in the right direction. We moved to LA because we believed it was the right things to do. We became homeless, but found people willing to give us blankets, food, money, a place to stay for a couple weeks.When we got too comfortable, He told us to leave by making our roommate unbearable (as my girlfriend put it.) We're homeless again, but just today we found a Social Security office miles closer than we thought, was given money and luck, and my girlfriend has a job interview. At first I assumed it was all coincidence, that it was the Universe and Karma finally paying itself back. But now ... I'm starting to genuinely believe. I just wanted to share this story with all of you. I just thought you would appreciate it.

This can be for continuing education or just for your own interest.  There are so many available that I just do not know what to choose. I am a Emergency RN who has been out of the job market since 2006. I basically burned out a bit and chose to stay at home with my little ones. Now they are grown enough that I need to get out of their hair and do something with myself. After much thought I have decided that I would like to go back to work as a RN.  I will start a 200 hour  program in August through South Dakota University to update my practice as a RN.   This will include online study and working with a preceptor for 80 hours.  I would like to start something now in the mean time.  Any ideas for me??

I do not mind putting things together or having to fiddle with the e-cig. One with a good throat hit, decent amount of vapor and higher amount of Nicotine. Any ideas for a Newbie like me.

1mw3p7	-30624	1379854023	electronic_cigarette	Suggestion for a inexpensive tank that is not "airy" like a Evod.	My question is ...I would like a suggestion for a tank for my Ego Twist that gives a good throat hit.  I found that the Evod is too airy and have been using a T3.  I like that I can change the atomizer myself and the throat hit is pretty tight like a cig. The problem that I am having with the T3 is that it seems that half my juice seems to drain out in the space between the atomizer. I like the way it vapes though but sick of wasting juice. I checked to make sure that the atomizer is on snug so that is not the problem. It seems to be draining out underneath the rubber on top of the atomizer. Any suggestions to either fix this problem or a different tank?

1nggto	-30624	1380567830	needadvice	Spanked on the hand at work,complained ...now I am out of a job! What to do?	IN BRIEF..Worked at a local Mini mart/gas station and was "spanked" on the hand by my employer.  He also became so irate with me that I felt the need to leave at the end of my shift.LONGER STORY FOR ANYONE INTERESTED...I just want to get this out there because I am so upset and have not stopped crying all afternoon.  My self esteem is in the toilet. I am a RN who is studying online for a Masters degree in Nursing.  I have my license on hold for the time being so I cannot work as a RN for now.  I have been disabled for the past five years with Crohns disease and Arthritis but have recently become well enough to feel that I could work part time.  I started a position at a local Mini market/Gas station around the corner from my home,  I do not own a car so my job choices were limited. I am also a mother of three pre teen children.  From the first day the manager has been treating me poorly.  On my first day he actually "spanked" my hand when he thought I was going to push the wrong button on a register.  It startled me and made me feel humiliated but I stupidly let it go. I should have said something right away but I had hoped things would get better and I really needed the job. Every day he would make me feel terrible even saying  snide remarks about my performance. I knew he did not like me but I was trying my best to make it work. The other employees told me  I was doing fantastic. I knew I was doing a good job and learning quickly.  Last week I received my first paycheck and my hours were incorrect.  I was told to speak to the manager and I attempted to do so.  When I approached him at his desk I mentioned that I there might have been a mistake on my hours and that  A few hours might be missing. Non accusatory and very calmly. He immediately started shaking and getting red.  I could tell he was getting pissed at me.  I continued to speak calmly even though he started yelling at me.  Telling me that I did not know what the heck I was talking about....How dare you question me! etc. He was escalating and I felt that I should leave the store immediately for safety.  I did say,while sobbing, that I would not be back if I was going to be treated poorly. I probably shouldnt have left but it was close to the end of my shift and I was a bit scared of his reaction.That same afternoon I went home and called the corporate offices and explained to them what happened and asked for their assistance.Today the district manager called me and basically said that since I do not get along with the manager I will not be coming back to the store. He explained to me that the manager has a "rough" management style that is not for everyone. Since I cannot get along with the manager I will not be coming back. I feel that the company is not taking responsibility for the managers actions and instead placing blame on me for "not getting along".  I do not feel that anyone could work in that environment.  Maybe because I have worked in a hospital for so long my expectations for treatment at this type of job are too high?  Do I have any recourse??  Is it just me??
1nl7lb	-30624	1380729223	ecigclassifieds	Have Evod's and wicks trade for T3 or similar?	I have new Evods with 5 new atomizers for trade. I would like to trade for T2 or something like it.

When I check the shipping it tells me that it has been in  Hong Kong since November 5th. I have tried to contact the company but no response.  I had heard that there were problems with battery shipping in the past but I thought it was for the bigger batteries.  Not sure what to do or if this is a normal problem with them.  I have ordered from Fast tech before with no delivery problems. Does anyone have advice for me ?

Does anyone have any other suggestions for places we might look in to?As far as other aspects of the wedding, does anyone have any local suggestions for:* great place for a rehearsal dinner* wedding cake - looking for a cupcake tower, so maybe the Cream &amp; Flutter formerly known as Cakes on Walnut, maybe?* musician for the ceremony - preferably someone who plays guitar or violin* photographer - for engagement photos and day of shooting* videographer* graphic designer - for invitations and/or save the date cards* wedding dress and men's apparel * flowers* anything else I'm not consideringWe are still in the early stages of planning (obviously!) but any suggestions would be much appreciated. If you've planned a wedding in C-U, I would certainly welcome any recommendations (pro or con). Thanks! P.S.

I want to start thinking about gifts for them. Does anyone have any great ideas they can share? A little background: my mom and dad have been married for 20+ years; his parents have been divorced for 10 years and FMIL has been remarried since 2007. Everyone is very different: different tastes, income levels, interests, etc. The more suggestions the better because we almost certainly won't be getting the same gifts for everyone.

They are, however, engaging in a couple of behaviors that I wasn't expecting. Firstly, they are beginning to chew the sides of the plastic edges in their cage; it's here: http://www.amazon.com/Kaytee-Habitat-Multi-Level-Exotics-18-Inch/dp/B00CETSHN2/ref=sr_1_18?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1399089943&amp;sr=8-18&amp;keywords=rat+cage. We put some wooden chew toys in the cage, but when they are feeling restless, they have started to chew on the plastic ledges. I've tried to give them a firm 'no' and put the wooden chew toys in front of them as a substitute. Any other ideas? Toy/chew suggestions?The second, (perhaps) larger issue is that the girls are *literally* sh**ting where they eat. We have cleaned up feces from the bedding at the bottom of the cage, but we have also found feces and urine on the platform directly next to their food. We have placed the food bowl on the highest platform and this seems to be where they spend the majority of their time. They are walking in their own urine and, I'm afraid, they have dropped their food in it. Any tips to help encourage them to take their potty business elsewhere?**TLDR: Tips to get our rats to stop chewing their plastic cage platforms and peeing next to their food?**

Since we are getting married on a holiday, we have been trying to get all of the big stuff taken care of as early as possible. Here's what we've got:* a ceremony venue and officiant* a reception venue and food * a cake* wedding rehearsal scheduled* rehearsal dinner location booked* wedding party * transportation between ceremony and reception for all guests* 2 hotel blocks reserved* website made* invitations (ordered and sent out)* photographer booked (with engagement session set for later this month)   So...now what? We aren't using a florist and we're not hiring a band. Are we forgetting something? EDIT: Of course we still have a ton to do and think about. I'm just wondering: is there anything else big that I'm forgetting? I guess I'm thinking in terms of vendors. I don't want to get to September and say "Ooops, we forgot to consider ______ and now nobody is available because we are getting married on New Year's Eve.
24zue6	-30658	1399505069	RATS	Rat spitting up food?	Today when I was cleaning out my rats' cage, I looked in their food bowl and there was what appeared to be vomit inside. I know rats can't vomit; the best way to describe it is that it looked like the vomit when a cat eats too quickly. It looked almost as though the girls had chewed the food to soften it and spit it back in the food bowl. Has anyone ever had this problem before? IS it a problem? There was no kind of mucus in the food bowl - just a mass of mushed up Oxbow Essentials. (There was also unmushed food left, as well).Thoughts?Background: we got these rats 6 days ago. One of them was sniffling immediately (nasal gurgly sound). We took them to the vet and she diagnosed them both with mycoplasmosis. I know this is common but for the sake of full disclosure, there it is.

In lieu of a bouquet, I would like to get my (4) bridesmaids each a nice clutch to carry down the aisle with them. I'm looking for something high quality and, if possible, at a good price; however, quality is my priority.They are all wearing different gowns so I would like to get them matching clutches to tie their looks together. Here are the wedding deets:Time of ceremony: 7pmTime of reception: 8:30-midnightColors: wedding colors are charcoal and wine. Bridesmaids are wearing different styles of dresses in varying shades of gray. I would like the clutches to be in the world of red/cranberry/wine for a pop of color. I would like something on the formal end since it's an evening event. So who out there has found bridesmaids clutches they love?

2hmzfo	-30658	1411845983	weddingplanning	I'm having a lot of fun planning my wedding thanks to some wonderful people in my life. Weddit, what's going right for you? [RAVE]	I am seeing a lot of [RANT]s on here and that sucks. I'm sorry for all of the brides and grooms out there who are having to deal with crappy situations. I am sending you all good juju.But in the midst of all this ranting, let's talk about what's going RIGHT. Here are a few of my most recent [RAVES]s.1.) My **mom** is amazing, supportive, and helpful. I love my MOH but my mom is truly my best friend. She's stepping up to some MOH responsibilities, which I love. I actually asked my mom to be my Matron of Honor but she said no. She thought it would be weird and she didn't want to stand up in front of everyone. When we disagree about something, she doesn't just say "Well, it's your big day," in that passive aggressive tone. She actually listens to me and hears me out. She isn't interested in 'tradition' or 'what people will think'. She wants us to have the wedding we want because she loves us. She's the bomb diggity and I have to stop writing because I am about to lose it.2.) **Our friends and family** are excited about our NYE wedding. Almost everyone universally and unanimously thinks that New Year's Eve is usually pretty lame. It's supposed to be this big night where we say goodbye to all of our mistakes and regrets, and we get to start over - with champagne, and glitter, and fanfare. I don't know about y'all but for me the night is usually pretty disappointing. Since we are getting married on NYE, our reception is actually a New Year's Eve party - nobody has to make plans, and everyone get to have fun. Our guests are totally stoked about it, which makes me **really REALLY happy**.3.) **My dress** is on its way to me as I write this. I should have plenty of time to get it altered and even practice my super sweet dance moves in it. 4.) My FH and I are loving our **weekly dance classes**. We are doing an 11 week social ballroom course (for a whopping $75/total). So far we have learned Nightclub Two-Step, Salsa, Waltz, and Swing. We are the strongest at swing and I think we have settled on our first dance being a swing to Hall &amp; Oates' "You Make My Dreams Come True". **TL;DR: Ladies and gents, what do you have to [RAVE] about?**

I got a text from my MOH yesterday that said "FYI: I put the kabosh on getting you 'sexy time things' for your bridal trousseau. I hope that was okay." So my question is: what is a bridal trousseau? I've tried spending some Google quality time with this but nothing really makes sense to me (the 'traditional' idea of a trousseau makes sense to me but what does it mean *now*?). I'm worried that FMIL will surprise me with this thing that I'm supposed to be excited about. If I say "Thanks! What is this thing?" she could easily become crushed and go into a major tailspin.

2hq36z	-30660	1411935199	WorldofTanks	A question to clear up a confusion	A friend and I were having a chat about why some of the Russian tanks have a log on the side. From what I've found by searching the forums and on Google, it portrays a log that is used to help unstick the tank from being stuck in mud. He said that this was wrong and that Russian tanks carried spare axles (?) as they were known to be prone to breaking. Therefore they would carry a spare to switch one out on the fly if it did break. He also said that he had multiple historical sources but did not elaborate. I'm no historian, so if someone could clear up A) if it is a log, B) did they carry spare axles, and if this is the case C) sources to cite for it both being a log and for being an axle, whichever's the case, I'd very much appreciate it!Thanks!

On my ELC AMX I decided to check what my progress was like and it appears it is at 86% (Or so) and I'm trying to get the third mark of excellence.1) Is the damage over 14 days a rolling average that I need to get, say, 1.5k damage every match to be able to effectively boost it up to over 95%? Or does it take the total damage done by everyone and give you a percentage accordingly?2) In the same vein of thought, in order to get the third, do I need to play the ELC to death for the next 14 days in order to have a chance at getting the 3rd mark, or could I just, say, play 5 games a day if they happen to be excellent matches where I do a high amount of damage in each?3) Yet at the same time, after a match where I got about 1.2k damage it went down to 85.91%? So assuming it's a rolling average, does that mean that in order to get it to increase I need to get over that amount every match for the next 14 days?4) What, considering all of that, would then be the most effective way to go for the third mark? My WN8 is about 1131 with a recent WN8 of 1538 (my username is RustyRoger on the EU server if you're interested). Thanks for bearing with me with that wall of text and any help you can give. With 10k games under my belt I feel almost a little embarrassed about asking about this as I should know by now surely.

Do you have any previous Clan Wars experience:I do not have any clan wars experience as of yetWhy do you want to join RDDT: I enjoy playing with other people, and my previous clan was mostly a few mates from a re-enactment society that we'd occasionally do platoons in. I'd very much like to get involved in team battles, clan wars etc. and have a chance to win (or buy) the reward tanks. Also, I'd like to improve my own play. Being a 1700 WN8 recent, player I'd like to continue trying to increase that (along with my overall) as much as possible.  What are your favourite tanks and why: FV4202. True it's top speed is 40 odd, but, it does 40 pretty much everywhere. It trolls the hell out of people auto-aiming (most bounce off the UFP if you reverse) and the gun is the excellent L7 from the Cent, except with a high rate of fire. IS-7 because the armour is great, mobility is pretty nice for a heavy, and the gun, while not my favourite, is still very workable. AMX ELC bis because pocket TD with immaculate camo, excellent mobility and a big gun. AMX CDC - high mobility, fast firing decent gun and is very aesthetically pleasing. Only downsides are that people do just turn their guns away from any immediate threats (such as an Obj 140 within 50m) to get you. But to turn that into a positive, it can provide a nice distraction for that friendly tank. The other one is module and crew damage. But hey. I can live with that. What other games do you play: Civ5, Portals, Age of Empires (2, mythology, 3), Battlefield 3 (occasionally), Kerbal Space Program, Minecraft, Fallout and Elder Scrolls franchises.

3erb3q	-30660	1437994394	askscience	How to amplify a specific isoform?	Say I pick the gene encoding p53 and want to amplify the nucleotide sequence for PCR. Is there a way to design a primer/take any other steps that will specifically allow me to get, for example, isoform A as the product when translated? Or does the fact that it it is a splice variant prevent me from altering the outcome easily from the PCR stage? If that is the case, is there a way to increase the likelihood of getting isoform A after that step?I have knowledge of the area, but little practical experience, so apologies if the answer is glaringly obvious! The question struck me when looking at the gene and looking at all the isoforms.

2kmidc	-30675	1414541321	DestinyTheGame	I've been wondering why the story of Destiny was so lacking and why so many people have been able to "glitch" into a new area, and then I stumbled onto this video on YouTube:	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ5BpeHVTWYIt's a relatively long video at 35 minutes long, but I believe it's worth a watch to anyone who feels that the game that they are playing now doesn't feel like a complete game. The more I watched this video, the more my eyes were opened and I started to understand what had been bothering me for so long. I believe many of you fellow Guardians will feel the same way and understand why our $60 went only as far as it did.Why are there areas of the map that you can glitch into that's not in the original release? Why are there no trading and/or gambling between players? Why is Mercury in PvP but not in PvE? Why did the lead creative writer of the game leave Bungie a year before the game was released?I feel as if I was sold a 4 bedroom home (for example), and was told that I could only use 2 rooms at first. To use the third and fourth room (that I could peek into), I would have to pay more money.This bothers me the same way that the day 1 DLC (From Ashes) bothered me for Mass Effect 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri0vrJ-y2zM (TotalBiscuit, The Cynical Brit)"If we are to secure a high quality future, we must reject a low quality present" - BDobbinsFTW

xjij3	-30716	1343874467	Chillosophy	Great Terrence Mckenna quotes. I think just about everything he says is quote worthy, but here are my favorites. Just pure poetry	“Chaos is what we've lost touch with. This is why it is given a bad name. It is feared by the dominant archetype of our world, which is Ego, which clenches because its existence is defined in terms of control.”― Terence McKenna“The syntactical nature of reality, the real secret of magic, is that the world is made of words. And if you know the words that the world is made of, you can make of it whatever you wish.”― Terence McKenna“If the words 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness' don't include the right to experiment with your own consciousness, then the Declaration of Independence isn't worth the hemp it was written on.”― Terence McKenna“You have to take seriously the notion that understanding the universe is your responsibility, because the only understanding of the universe that will be useful to you is your own understanding.”― Terence McKenna“You are an explorer, and you represent our species, and the greatest good you can do is to bring back a new idea, because our world is endangered by the absence of good ideas. Our world is in crisis because of the absence of consciousness.”― Terence McKenna“Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under, it will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is how magic is done. By hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering its a feather bed.”― Terence McKenna“The cost of sanity in this society, is a certain level﻿ of alienation”― Terence McKenna“Ego is a structure that is erected by a neurotic individual who is a member of a neurotic culture against the facts of the matter. And culture, which we put on like an overcoat, is the collectivized consensus about what sort of neurotic behaviors are acceptable.”― Terence McKenna“Television is by nature the dominator drug par excellence. Control of content, uniformity of content, repeatability of content make it inevitably a tool of coersion, brainwashing, and manipulation.”― Terence McKenna“Right here and now, one quanta away, there is raging a universe of active intelligence that is transhuman, hyperdimensional, and extremely alien... What is driving religious feeling today is a wish for contact with this other universe.”― Terence McKenna“It is the imagination that argues for the Divine Spark within human beings. It is literally a decent of the World's Soul into all of us.”― Terence McKenna“My voice speaking is a monkey's mouth making little mouth noises that are carrying agree-upon meaning, and it is meaning that matters. Without the meaning one has only little mouth noises ”― Terence McKenna, The Archaic Revival “Psychedelics are illegal not because a loving government is concerned that you may jump out of a third story window. Psychedelics are illegal because they dissolve opinion structures and culturally laid down models of behaviour and information processing. They open you up to the possibility that everything you know is wrong.”― Terence McKenna“The apocalypse is not something which is coming. The apocalypse has arrived in major portions of the planet and it’s only because we live within a bubble of incredible privilege and social insulation that we still have the luxury of anticipating the apocalypse.”― Terence McKenna“You are a divine being. You matter, you count. You come from realms of unimaginable power and light, and you will return to those realms.”― Terence McKenna“Time will perfect matter.”― Terence McKenna“The ufo is nothing more than an assertion of herself by the Goddess into history, saying to science and paternalistically governed and driven organizations: You have gone far enough. We are going to turn the world upside down. Your science is going to be shown up for what it is, nothing more than a pleasant metaphor usefully extrapolated into the production of toys for healthy children. That's what science is good for.It is not some meta-theory at whose feet every point of view from astrology to acupressure to channeling need be laid to have the hand of science announce thumbs up or thumbs down.”― Terence McKenna“A hallucination is a species of reality, as capable of teaching you as a videotape about Kilimanjaro or anything else that falls through your life.”― Terence McKenna“Nature is not our enemy, to be raped and conquered. Nature is ourselves, to be cherished and explored.”― Terence McKenna“We have been to the moon, we have charted the depths of the ocean and the heart of the atom, but we have a fear of looking inward to ourselves because we sense that is where all the contradictions flow together.”― Terence McKenna“If you don't have a plan, you become part of somebody else's plan.”― Terence McKenna“There is a transcendental dimension beyond language... It's just hard as hell to talk about!”― Terence McKenna“I’ll try to be around and about. But if I’m not, then you know that I’m behind your eyelids, and I’ll meet you there”― Terence McKenna“We tend to disempower ourselves. We tend to believe that we don’t matter. And in the act of taking that idea to ourselves we give everything away to somebody else, to something else.”― Terence McKenna“My technique is don’t believe anything. If you believe in something, you are automatically precluded from believing its opposite.”― Terence McKenna“Reality is, you know, the tip of an iceberg of irrationality that we've managed to drag ourselves up onto for a few panting moments before we slip back into the sea of the unreal.”― Terence McKenna“Half the time you think your thinking you’re actually listening”― Terence McKenna“We live in condensations of our imagination”― Terence McKenna“We are the inheritors of a million years of striving for the unspeakable.”― Terence McKenna

I remember them almost always, and sometimes they are so detailed, they out beat stories I can come up with when I'm awake. This one particularly, I felt like writing down because of that.Mad props if you actually felt like reading the whole damn thing. Let me start with Mila Kunis. She showed up at our place with her friend Courtney, just after the general population was hit with notifications from the government about population control. The idea was to infect a few groups of a thousand or so people from across the country and get them to become, for a period of 24-48/hrs, hungry for human flesh as well as boost their blood flow and numb their central nervous system, giving them simple "super human" qualities.Anyway, there was nothing anyone could do except for figure out some sort of defensive strategy....and for some reason it led to the biggest known party event I'd ever see. People were getting drunk in the streets, bar hopping, and even house hopping to random people's houses to see if they had anything fun to party with before the zombies broke loose. This is where Mila and her friend come in. She knocks on my door so I open it and invite them in without question. Down the hall, I see this guy running towards us, eyes locked on me, my first impression was to slam the door (zombies) but after I did I heard a knock, so I assumed he was still safe and opened the door. The man quickly counted heads of people in the house, and handed me several thin syringes with purple glowing liquid inside. I can't remember exactly what he said but I guess they were some sort of antidote that would remedy a bite. I thanked him and sent him on his way. Back to Mila Kunis. Her friend had seemed interested in me since they arrived, shooting me glances as she passed me in the kitchen, the hall way, so I built up enough courage to start a conversation with her. It became plainly obvious that she was into me at this point because she decided after 5 minutes of "all this craziness going on, I can't believe it, how will I spend possibly my last night alive, etc...", a conversation I would assume helped many single people that night, that I was now her boyfriend. I wasn't going to argue against it.So we're all hanging out in my room and having a good time. Not really partying, just sort of getting to know each other, stuff I would expect in a situation where you're just sort of waiting for a mini-apocalypse. Courtney was stroking my hair, I was telling her things about me when she asked. Mila was quite the life of the party. I assume because she was free to talk and tell jokes with semi strangers without them glorifying her for her celebrity status (we really didn't care at this point). Courtney suggested we go to her grandparents place as they live in a remote area, countryside in a small town called "Hope" Oregon. Seeing as how we still had a few hours until the expected event and they were about an hour away, we packed up anything we could see as having weapon like abilities and packed the Jeep. Listening to the radio on the way, trying to gather any further info about the zombie out-brake. Nothing new, nobody knew where it would happen or what method was going to be used, but they knew there were eight different areas in the country that were planned for strike spots. We get into town and notice a lot of people in the downtown area. Definitely more than double the population of the town itself. Turns out we weren't the only group of people who thought it would be smart to come to this small town to get away from the amount of people in the city. We stop near a corner market to loot what ever else we might need. Out of the corner of my eye, I see a few people walking by with those same skinny syringes we were given. I immediately stop them and ask about any further information they had about what it is and where it came from, they had no idea other than they were given them in the same manner I was. They also knew a lot of other people in town with them and had decided to meet up near by in some sort of mechanic shop (for the purpose of the rolling garage doors, good zombie defense). They all decided to meet there and group up because with everyone having the supposed antidote, there was apparently very little risk of infection. I was very skeptical of the whole thing at this point, not having any info about the "antidote" at all, I assumed it was going to some how play a part in the actual infection itself. I talked it over with my group and we decided to give them our syringes. All but one that someone must have misplaced. We get to Courtney's grandparents' house for refuge and we have dinner which was already prepared. Through our conversations, I became increasingly anxious. Everyone just sitting and talking like it was a normal get together, it was starting to make me sick. I was still keeping the radio on to hear when the strikes begin to occur and listen for which locations are being hit. More and more reports of these purple syringes, nobody knew what they were. Courtney came over to me wondering what was wrong. It was an odd relationship we had, I started to think, I mean given the circumstances it made sense to me that two people who thought of each other as being attractive would rather rush into a relationship than be alone when there is a chance you would never be able to experience love again. I accepted this, kissed her and asked if I could use her phone. The grandparents didn't have internet, but there was still a few bars of phone service. I started google-ing anything I could possibly find about these syringes and came to a site that was just built to receive locations of everyone who had them. Trying to form a theoretical connection between them and the locations of the events. This made sense to me, so I inputted my location and found that we were in a hot spot. They were spread out pretty much across the country but there was accumulations of high quantities here, as well as 7 other obvious hot spots. I was taken back a little, although it didn't necessarily surprise me. I deleted internet history so Courtney couldn't see it. I didn't want everyone to know where we actually were, I had to come up with some sort of a clear plan that everyone could follow. My new girlfriend was increasingly interested in what I was so distraught about, kept asking me what was wrong but I needed to think. "NOT NOW, COURTNEY". The room went silent, she had a hurt look on her face and went to sob in the guest room. I felt like an ass, and everyone else obviously thought of me as one but I didn't care at the moment, I was on to something.The radio then flickered and cut to a live feed of a reporter covering the first known event. Apparently there was a reported explosion in the distance and within minutes, half of the people on the streets at the time were infected, the other half taken over by the infected. I heard someone in the background on the radio scream something about the purple liquid. In my mind there were two options. Obviously this was an airborne infection and we needed to stay inside. Given the fact that we were in a hot spot for the purple glowing liquid, we would most definitely see the strike here any time now. The two possible outcomes were 1: The syringes were there to further the infection. What a better way to do that then give people an "Antidote", and 2: The syringes were actually a cure, and in which case we were screwed anyway because we gave ours up.Either one of those situations would most likely have no positive outcome, seeing as how our only possible hope for surviving was the slight chance the antidote did work, that didn't even matter because I convinced everyone they were sketchy enough to just give away. All but one, I remembered. I asked everyone in the room if they remembered who didn't give me theirs but they all said they did. Except for Courtney in the other room, so I rushed in. She was in tears still and I felt horrible. She was brave enough to be so up front with me at the beginning and I could tell it was because she felt lonely, but I completely shut her down. I apologized sincerely and she forgave me. I asked her about the syringe, where she thought she might have put it and hoping she didn't leave it back at my place. She told me she remembered taking it to the car but didn't feel like taking the time to go looking for it when we gave ours up, so it must still be there. I stood her up, kissed her like it was going to be the last kiss I'd ever experience, and then I ran out of the house. I took the Jeep over to the area I heard everyone would be meeting up with these syringes. As I got there I found the missing one in between the seats, it was still good. As I am getting out of the car, walking to the location I hear a huge explosion and see a giant trail of smoke in the distance. Immediately after that, the group I was looking for opened the garage doors to the shop and sped toward the explosion in several different vehicles. One of them stopped in front of me, opened the door and the man I gave all ours to held out his hand and said "You need to inject this." I thought about it for a quick second and it was the only logical thing to do, I was dead if I didn't either way I looked at it. I took my own out of my jacket pocket and did as he instructed. He told me as I was pulling it back out of my arm, that I was basically their test subject in doing so. None of them had injected, because at this point they were as skeptical as I was (they had also seen the website with the hot spots). He closed the door and waited. Within a minute I was hit with what seemed to be an intense fever and starting with where I injected and streaming up my arm, I felt a burning sensation like molten metal. I collapsed and wretched. They figured it had started to infect me and threw out the backpack of syringes. The guy I had spoken with handed me a pistol, said he wouldn't blame me if I wanted to end it now, and sped off with his group to the hills. I sat there contemplating my options. I guess I waited too long, because I blacked out. I woke up minutes later to find everyone running and screaming in the streets. I felt more than fine, my heart rate was climbing, blood pulsing intensely through my veins, even the spot in my arm where I put the needle felt just fine now. I grabbed the pistol and threw the backpack on. This purple liquid I figured to be some sort of counteractive solution to the infection. Same side-effects, but I was still me. No time to think about it, there were zombies who had started to notice me and there were small groups of them gathering as they ran full speed in my direction. I grabbed the pistol and started running toward the explosion, the answer had to be there. The problem was the majority of the infected were between me and where I wanted to go. I found that I could now leap overhead of them, so I started doing this and anything else I could teach myself in the moment to avoid as much contact as possible. They began to start to follow me and group even more, but I was much faster. Eventually I arrived at the point of the explosion and I had about half a minute until they all caught up with me. It looked like the structure was newly built and it actually had a spot to put these syringes. About 20 ports for them, so I quickly inserted them and noticed a "launch button". I figured this machine started the outbreak since it already had empty syringes of the same size in the ports that I put these ones into. I slammed my hand on the launch button, just as the infected breached the barbed wire fence and I watched all the purple liquid stream into a canister, which then shot up into the air. The zombies tackled me in a group and just as I pulled out my pistol again, I heard another explosion. Everyone looked up in the sky dumbfounded by the noise, I stood up and pointed my weapon while backing away from the group. I managed to slip past them and started to run back to the house. As I looked back, I saw the group experience the same symptoms the glowing liquid gave me. Back at the house, I still had more than enough antidote for everyone. They all took it and now that we were certain her grandparents were safe, we packed back up and headed for home. Once we reached my place, we spent the rest of the night continuing our conversations we were having before deciding to find "Hope" in a deserted place.

I felt like an ass, and everyone else obviously thought of me as one but I didn't care at the moment, I was on to something.The radio then flickered and cut to a live feed of a reporter covering the first known event. Apparently there was a reported explosion in the distance and within minutes, half of the people on the streets at the time were infected, the other half taken over by the infected. I heard someone in the background on the radio scream something about the purple liquid. In my mind there were two options. Obviously this was an airborne infection and we needed to stay inside. Given the fact that we were in a hot spot for the purple glowing liquid, we would most definitely see the strike here any time now. The two possible outcomes were 1: The syringes were there to further the infection. What a better way to do that then give people an "Antidote", and 2: The syringes were actually a cure, and in which case we were screwed anyway because we gave ours up.Either one of those situations would most likely have no positive outcome, seeing as how our only possible hope for surviving was the slight chance the antidote did work, that didn't even matter because I convinced everyone they were sketchy enough to just give away. All but one, I remembered. I asked everyone in the room if they remembered who didn't give me theirs but they all said they did. Except for Courtney in the other room, so I rushed in. She was in tears still and I felt horrible. She was brave enough to be so up front with me at the beginning and I could tell it was because she felt lonely, but I completely shut her down. I apologized sincerely and she forgave me. I asked her about the syringe, where she thought she might have put it and hoping she didn't leave it back at my place. She told me she remembered taking it to the car but didn't feel like taking the time to go looking for it when we gave ours up, so it must still be there. I stood her up, kissed her like it was going to be the last kiss I'd ever experience, and then I ran out of the house. I took the Jeep over to the area I heard everyone would be meeting up with these syringes. As I got there I found the missing one in between the seats, it was still good. As I am getting out of the car, walking to the location I hear a huge explosion and see a giant trail of smoke in the distance. Immediately after that, the group I was looking for opened the garage doors to the shop and sped toward the explosion in several different vehicles. One of them stopped in front of me, opened the door and the man I gave all ours to held out his hand and said "You need to inject this." I thought about it for a quick second and it was the only logical thing to do, I was dead if I didn't either way I looked at it. I took my own out of my jacket pocket and did as he instructed. He told me as I was pulling it back out of my arm, that I was basically their test subject in doing so. None of them had injected, because at this point they were as skeptical as I was (they had also seen the website with the hot spots). He closed the door and waited. Within a minute I was hit with what seemed to be an intense fever and starting with where I injected and streaming up my arm, I felt a burning sensation like molten metal. I collapsed and wretched. They figured it had started to infect me and threw out the backpack of syringes. The guy I had spoken with handed me a pistol, said he wouldn't blame me if I wanted to end it now, and sped off with his group to the hills. I sat there contemplating my options. I guess I waited too long, because I blacked out. I woke up minutes later to find everyone running and screaming in the streets. I felt more than fine, my heart rate was climbing, blood pulsing intensely through my veins, even the spot in my arm where I put the needle felt just fine now. I grabbed the pistol and threw the backpack on. This purple liquid I figured to be some sort of counteractive solution to the infection. Same side-effects, but I was still me. No time to think about it, there were zombies who had started to notice me and there were small groups of them gathering as they ran full speed in my direction. I grabbed the pistol and started running toward the explosion, the answer had to be there. The problem was the majority of the infected were between me and where I wanted to go. I found that I could now leap overhead of them, so I started doing this and anything else I could teach myself in the moment to avoid as much contact as possible. They began to start to follow me and group even more, but I was much faster. Eventually I arrived at the point of the explosion and I had about half a minute until they all caught up with me. It looked like the structure was newly built and it actually had a spot to put these syringes. About 20 ports for them, so I quickly inserted them and noticed a "launch button". I figured this machine started the outbreak since it already had empty syringes of the same size in the ports that I put these ones into. I slammed my hand on the launch button, just as the infected breached the barbed wire fence and I watched all the purple liquid stream into a canister, which then shot up into the air. The zombies tackled me in a group and just as I pulled out my pistol again, I heard another explosion. Everyone looked up in the sky dumbfounded by the noise, I stood up and pointed my weapon while backing away from the group. I managed to slip past them and started to run back to the house. As I looked back, I saw the group experience the same symptoms the glowing liquid gave me. Back at the house, I still had more than enough antidote for everyone. They all took it and now that we were certain her grandparents were safe, we packed back up and headed for home. Once we reached my place, we spent the rest of the night continuing our conversations we were having before deciding to find "Hope" in a deserted place.

I met this girl last week on my way home from a show, we had a great conversation for about an hour before she asked for my number. I sent her a text the other day asking if she would join me for dinner next week sometime and she said it sounded fun and would let me know what day works for her when she gets her work schedule. Now, this is the first date I've been on in four years, but she is definitely my type and I would love to show her a great time. Maybe some of you can give me a few ideas. Thanks for reading!

1utub9	-30716	1389303337	armchairphilosophy	My thoughts on intimacy. Scientific reasoning for "Love" VS our own perception of it.	I think intimacy is probably one of the most important things to experience throughout our lives. I hope most people would actually, given that our most basic and primal instinct is the need for orgasm.Don't let the previous statement throw you off. The purpose of this is to bridge a gap between physical pleasure and pure emotional connections.Your body is telling you "orgasm is good, strive for it, you need it" because your body wants to pass down life, purely survival instincts at this point. Being mammal we look for a mate, have offspring, raise said offspring, they then carry on your legacy and genes to generations ahead. Now drifting away from elementary biology; our bodies have given us a gift. To be able to become emotionally connected to one another. You can call it love, or you could simply call it synapses instinctively firing in order to establish a sense of dependency to another living being in this void that is life. Either way, through direct communication (verbal or physical) to people you are attracted to (whether it is a hot one night stand, life partner of 30+ years, or a simple light heart-ed movie date) you can more effectively expand your own knowledge, consciousness, etc.Set aside the fact that our bodies quite literally drug themselves during these "love" encounters (first passionate kiss, cuddling, sex, even just seeing that someone for the first time that day). Set aside the fact that for emotional stability and health, simply "cuddling" alone has been proven to increase the flow of dopamine and serotonin over all throughout the day, and decrease depression levels to a near cure in some cases.Mammals are simply pairing creatures, we can't help but feel the need to connect. Biologically it seems so for very selfish reasons; carrying on your gene pool, survival, euphoria. The thing is we don't have to enslave ourselves to the instinct we all have of depending on another person to make us feel whole. We can choose to manipulate this, given the level of consciousness we as humans have. This is where the argument of "love" comes into play, as technically no, love does not exist at least by our current scientific findings. "Love" is what keeps civilization alive. Where would we be without emotional ties to the people in our lives? Now go back thousands of years and take those emotions out of the picture, I don't know if we would still be here today (at least not in any sort of healthy society).The beauty of it all is when you see these two creatures together, both longing for that connection and assurance that they are not alone in the void. When "love" happens, one might even sacrifice oneself to preserve not one's legacy, but just one life completely disassociated with it.Everyone spends most of their waking life alone, so why not take a chance, even if it's just sitting on a couch watching TV with someone you just met at a friend's house, because you never know where it could go or what you could learn.Intimate communication is what I personally find in my most cherished memories, sexual encounters not included. The way I see it, even if I head over to a friend's house who happens to be a girl, no intimacy at all, I still gain that much more knowledge, expand my awareness of the opposite sex that much more. To the point where now when I watch a movie with a girl I really do like, I'm not watching the movie completely for my own personal gain and entertainment (granted I might shush during intense scenes), but rather to learn about the person through how they react to the movie and how similar it is to my reactions. Actually that specifically is a great way to make certain connections that will either help establish deeper levels of communication with that person, or at the very least it is great practice.In conclusion, why try to argue whether love is real or not? Even if there is no undiscovered force that drives us together and links us in higher levels of consciousness we are not yet aware of, we can still enjoy this experience to the full extent just the way we are designed to do. Even without feeling like it is just an instinctive emotion that has no merit, because until we do discover that such a thing as love exists, we can still enjoy the search for it.

They have no faces, infact, boobs would be odd places for faces which is why boobs are just boobs and also why no matter who's face is facing these boobs, the heart for that face always races when those boobs it faces. Then again the face for those boobs can always see you facing those boobs, thinking you are facing with out a trace of your heart racing, when in fact you too, are a boob, and all boobs have faces.
2lsprv	-30716	1415569539	raspberry_pi	Clustering 2 Raspberry Pi computers and overclocking.	I was just wondering if anyone here can give insight into this. I am soon purchasing a setup and will probably buy 2 so I can stack them and overclock the CPU. Ultimately the goal will be faster downloading and, if it works this way, hopefully at that point being able to use N64 emulators without so much lag. I can see stacking even more and overclocking further if this works in order to at some point play PS2 and GameCube games. Any other suggestions are definitely welcome, I haven't purchased anything yet so feel free to throw my idea out the window and suggest a better one if you have it!

I recently began watching Gokaiger at the recommendation of someone online and holy crap I love it. I used to watch MMPR like pretty much everyone else when I was younger so all of this feels nostalgic as hell, which is awesome. I've actually become pretty attached to the characters and I hate the thought of the show ending and the next sentai I watch not being as good character wise. My question is what are some other good series where the characters are as good, if not better, than Gokaiger? Thanks

These are most likely either bots or untrustworthy people.For example, if you look into the review sections of many not-at-all interesting games you will find reviews written by people who have near a hundred games and only one review through their whole history, these look suspicions for a reason. If I am wrong, Reddit has full justification to tie me to a pole and burn me.

So, i got dark souls a couple days ago and absolutely love it, but I have noticed a thing.So, the second boss (usually) that the player fights, is the taurus demon or as the trader in undead burg calls him, the bull demon. Anyone who has as much useless knowledge as me, will notice that this is an allusion to the zodiac system.Basically, there exist 12 zodiac symbols, and they go as follows:1. ♈ Aries2. ♉ Taurus3. ♊ Gemini4. ♋ Cancer5. ♌ Leo6. ♍ Virgo7. ♎ Libra8. ♏ Scorpio9. ♐ Sagittarius10. ♑ Capricorn11. ♒ Aquarius12. ♓ PiscesAs you can see, there is a striking resemblance between the 2nd zodiac and the taurus demon, both in name and meaning, as the ♉ represents a bull, and that is what the taurus demon is: a huge-ass bull.Another example of this pattern is the Capra demon boss encountered not long after the bull demon in the game. This corresponds with the capricorn (♑) which represents a goat. This can be seen in the bosses design as it is basically that: a huge-ass goat.Both of these bosses follow the same naming pattern: **greek name for creature** + demon.But what I find interesting about this, is that there are only two examples of zodiac-related bosses in any of the dark souls games, as the zodiac system presents many interesting ideas - (like ♋ or cancer, which would be just a huge-ass crab).I believe that this may have been initially planned, but was later cut down, as 12 bosses are hard to do, or maybe it was just a small nod to ancient mythology by the developers.Anyway, I just thought that it was interesting that there would be these two bosses that have such a clear association with the zodiacs.thanks bye.

Well, today, on my second playthrough, I noticed the numerous tombstones lining the walls in the room along with Gwyn's statue.[knights](http://imgur.com/49kOapV,MZTGYY9)[Gwynh + Knights] (http://imgur.com/49kOapV,MZTGYY9#1)These tombs can be assumed to be those of silver knights (you can tell because it is obvious), but why there?We all know that Gwyn was essentially a super-god in all of Lordran, and statues of him by all rights should be everywhere, but why would it be in the same room as the silver knights?I believe that the knights whose tombstones were in that room, were the same knights who displayed the highest of honors and went to the kiln of the first flame with gwyn, knowing they will die, but going there anyway, the same knights you fight many times to get to Gwyn.Or alternatively it might be a symbolism for the great dragon war, as Gough said that for every dragon, the giants lost three score of knights, but I couldn't count the tombs in the room because I was too busy not giving a fuck.

I'm not too sureput in below the house of brown: alright, so I googled yellowstone brown. First thing that came up was a photo gallery that says "Night falls around what was then Ranger Gary Brown's home. —Originally published in "Yellowstone Wildlife in Winter," National Geographic magazine", so I go to it and find the picture of the house. In the description it says "Today, this structure serves as the Lamar Ranger Station, which provides housing for the Lamar ranger and emergency visitor services. Built near the turn of the century, it is on the National Register of Historic Places." interesting, well lets find lamar ranger station on a map, oh and what do you know, it's right down that canyon.from there it's no place for the meek: not too sure the meaning of this lineThe end is ever drawing nigh: there's a creek called rose creek that stems off next to that ranger station that eventually comes to an end, possibly alluding to that?There’ll be no paddle up your creek: once again, alluding to the creek in some way?Just heavy loads and water high: more stuff possibly referring to the creekIf you’ve been wise and found the blaze: if you look on google maps, right under where rose creek ends there was a giant fire, in fact you can see it on google maps if you look it upLook quickly down, your quest to cease: where to actually look down is the questionIt all sounds like it goes together pretty well so yeah.Anyway, if this information is helpful and you do find the treasure, throw some my way please.

265r72	-30751	1400711793	Cruise	Best cruises for honeymoon?	Hey everyone,I've never been on a cruise, and neither has my fiancee, so planning this whole thing is kinda crazy because neither of us know what to expect. I've been looking at Royal Caribbean (is the 50% off one passenger really good?), and Princess. I have a few questions, and if any of your advice doesn't apply to those questions, just say it! I want to be as informed as possible before I make my decision.First off, what's carnival like? I notice their prices are way lower, and that appeals to me because I could get a better room, but is it worse in quality? Would I be better off getting a cheaper room on a better cruise? Also, is it worth it to get a better room? I imagine that having a few drinks, or breakfast on the balcony would be really nice. What is the best cruise line for fun and entertainment? I notice that Celebrity looks like a 50+ relaxation sort of boat. I want relaxing, but exciting. Allure of the seas from Royal really appealed to me because of all the food, bars, and activities they had that all seemed geared towards younger people (we are 21 and 22), but is that really how it is?Are the drink packages worth it? I drink coffee every morning, I drink at least 3-4 bottles of water a day, I'd probably have 3+ alcoholic beverages per day.What other fees am I looking at? For example if I see that a cruise is 1249 per person, I'm paying about 2498 for the cabin. I know I can expect about 200 on top of that for taxes and fees, but what else? What should I expect to budget outside of that 2498 that I will need to fully enjoy my cruise? That's all I have on my mind for right now, but like I said before, if you have any other tips, tricks, or ideas to help make my honeymoon perfect that would be awesome. Thanks so much for reading my wall of text!

I really want to get into it, but all of it looks pretty intimidating, and I have relatively little knowledge of how electricity works. Any tutorial suggestions would be helpful as well. EDIT: in response to /u/TeaTrees, here's some more info to hopefully guide people in the right direction of what I'm looking for:I've used clearos, not really looking at that. I used a friends nemesis and thought it was absolutely amazing. He was explaining that it was a dripping setup, which didn't seem too bad, but I'd like something a bit more portable. So I guess what I'm looking for is a rebuild-able atomizer tank system, along with a nice mech mod. I'm open to suggestions for anything, but I guess what I want is clouds, and good flavor. My price range would be within 0-200, but the cheaper the better. Also, I know there are clones of builds, and I'm completely open to that as well.

The power poll that is associated with my address is way on the opposite side of the property and nowhere near the house (. That poll has no ATT, so ATT's system says "no service at the address", but we don't even use that poll for power or anything at all. The power poll that we get our power from is about 50 ft away from our house, and its associated with a different street. This poll has ATT uverse, I've confirmed it with our neighbors that live on that street. I've been trying to explain this to the representatives in the ordering department on the phone, but they don't get it at all. Is there anyone else to contact, or any way to just get a technician out to my house?

The power poll that is associated with my address is way on the opposite side of the property and nowhere near the house (. That poll has no ATT, so ATT's system says "no service at the address", but we don't even use that poll for power or anything at all. The power poll that we get our power from is about 50 ft away from our house, and its associated with a different street. This poll has ATT uverse, I've confirmed it with our neighbors that live on that street. I've been trying to explain this to the representatives in the ordering department on the phone, but they don't get it at all. Is there anyone else to contact, or any way to just get a technician out to my house? It'd be a super easy installation, we have PVC pipe with a rope pull from that poll, but just because they think we use a different poll, we can't get anyone to install it out here.

36la18	-30751	1432100237	magicTCG	I'm new and want to play at FNM	Hey guys,My brother recently got me into magic by letting me build a deck with some of his cards last week. I built a black and white deck and fell in love with the game. I bought 4 of the dragons of tarkir prerelease packs for 20$ each at my local card shop and built a deck. I've been playing against my brother (who's also pretty new to the game) and I really want to get out and play against some other people at my local Friday night magic, but its pretty intimidating since I know most people playing at those things have been playing for years and have poured hundreds of dollars into their decks. I have a few concerns:1) how do I know if my deck is even valid?2) will I just get absolutely destroyed really quickly?3) is FNM cool to noobs? Will I just frustrate people due to my relative lack of knowledge of the rules?I really want to get out there and play more but the whole scene is pretty intimidating having existed for twenty-two years.

I am posting this here, instead of /r/medical because I figure this community might have more knowledge in the area.I have fairly large pores in the creases where my nose meets my cheeks.(The sides of the nostrils)Out of these pores grows... What pretty much seems like skin/dead skin cells, in the shape of hair somewhat...It's more like a spikey shape of dead human skin... I'd describe it as skin flake scales? Really small though... Like regular hair follicles... but this is definitely NOT hair.It's similar to what those with "morgellon's disease" claim to have coming out of them, except this isn't fibrous.I think I have some sort of mutated sebaceous glands/hair follicles. Instead of the follicle growing the standard structure of hair, it's growing out something that's like a combination of skin cell and sebum.I've had these for a few years now, and my girlfriend is studying biology/medicine and she's fascinated by them.Any advice/ideas on what this could be?

About a year ago I came up with an equation to map out how many outputs you would have for a given number of inputs given a situation of multi-state logic.AKA a logic AND truth table with more inputs than just 0 and 1, like 2, 3, 4, 5, etc...Now, I don't remember the sub-rules I created for the 'AND' function...And I lost all my notes.I just remember that the equation I created was a very simple quadratic equation, it was something like 1/2*x^2 + 1/2*x + 1 or something like that... I don't remember if my rules for the AND were to literally just add the numbers together, or to keep the smallest number, IE 'AND'ing 3 and 5 produces an output of 3 or if this were a NAND and produced a 2? or does it produce an 8?I mean, essentially I just want to figure out that equation again, and not having the work I did laying around is killing me...Whoever helps me out with this may need to have a good understanding of logic, truth tables, and algebraic math.Thank you very much!

I actually chuckled when my dad said your baby sister died. Then panic happen. I actually gave all my money to my friend to drive me home.All the way home, I keep crying and I said to my self that my sister did not die. But soon after I arrived at hospital, I did not go to emergency room, instead I went to the morgue. As soon I see my mom there, I finally broke down and accepted my sister death.My relative blames me for her death. They said if she didn't drive me to the town, she wouldn't caught in the rain and that lorry won't hit her. I miss her . I miss her everyday.

The sound is more like something bashed their body to the door and the weird thing is we can hear something bouncing before another door were "knocked".My dad warned us no matter what, don't ever open the door. Mostly the knocking happened after midnight. So you can imagine that every night for a month, we slept with something bashing our door off.The knocking happened for 44 days but one week after the knocking, my dad finally had enough and goes outside. I remembered my dad stayed outside for always two hours. And then he come back in to the house but until these day, my dad refused to say what is he saw outside.I don't really believe in supernatural because I never been actually encounter live on the face (honestly I don't want to) but as far I heard for peoples who see it, [it would likely look like this](rossrightangle.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/pocong.png)

251wk0	-30763	1399566824	greysanatomy	Foreshadowing *spoiler*	What I love about this show is sometime it's foreshadowed something and we don't even realize it.*When Derek were apologizing for not telling Meredith he was married in season 2 season premiers , he said that relationship with her is freah take of breath and it's like she saving him from drowning. Derek end up saving Meredith from drowning in season 3*Arizona said to Alex in season 5 that she hates flying and the plane could highly crash with her, She end up in plane crash that she took a seat from Alex in season 8.*When Derek were carrying a ring that he use to proposed to Meredith in season 5, he said that it's dangerous and it's like a gun who going to get off, Derek were shot a season later* Don't you find it ironic that Derek also get shot like his dad. Both only males in Shepard's family. (Except Baby Bailey now)*Lexis said to Mark when she broke his penis in season 5 that when she hurt, she want someone to hold her hand and play with her hair. Mark were holding hand and were soothing her hair when she died in season 8 finales...What more?

1agedp	-30767	1363505261	leagueoflegends	My suggestion to new Champion Select system.	Hello people.Today i was thinking about new system to Champion Select and I have idea with I love to share with you.Many times I read in Champion Select conversation that look like this "I mid if you don't trust me check my Lolking and my last 3 matches with Katarina on mid"So why not just add that option to Champion Select screen?Example,When I enetr to Champion Select screen I can just run my cursor to nickname of my teammate and at this time on my screen appears small window/frame with last 6 matches what this player play.But this window/frame will show only last 6 RANKED game. Why only ranked game? Becouse many of us know that on normal game many players like to have some fun and test new builds on champions or just play with friends who just trolling by picking 5 tanks or 5 supports.Why that way? Becouse if we can see last 6 matches in game not in lolking (copy and paste nickname and search for this player this action take a lot of time) that will be more easier to find a bad player (troll) by view his last 6 matches with karma AD or always ending match with 0/12/0 stats.And now how we can kick that player? Maybe just for voting like surrender but all 4 players must agree to kick this bad player (troll) and he will get ban to queue for 2-3 min. Or just leave from game like it is now.This is only my idea and I wanna know what you think about it.Greetings Negnal.

Sorry, meant to get around to posting this yesterday...Anyways, we know Sorin helped seal the Eldrazi and that some helplessly stupid planeswalker (Nissa) opened up said jail and released unspeakable horrors upon said plane. It seems now that in the next set, a helplessly selfish planeswalker (Liliana) is going to open up the Helvault and release unspeakable horrors upon another plane.The discussion is this: What are you feelings about Sorin's nature and the cosmological circumstances that see his "good" actions being undone by other planeswalkers who are too stupid or don't care. I feel like Sorin is this sad sap jailer who keeps showing up just a few minutes too late to stop the criminals from escaping.And to fend off accusations to start, 1.) I am not trying to paint Sorin in a pathetic light, just want to discuss other's feelings on this 2.) I realize Sorin didn't necessarily MAKE the Helvault, but he made Avacyn, close enough.Reference:http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/178

I am hoping for some suggestions, right now I know I like the look of the Mustangs from 2005+, but I am not married to any make or model and am hoping to spend at most $15,000 but would be happier with something in the $10-12k range. I don't drive too often, usually just on the weekends. Hoping for something that will be at least as reliable as my last car which I had for 8 years. I also live in the Chicago area if that is needed (I am not looking for listings per say, just advice on make/models)Really just trying to educate myself but I don't know where to start! Also, sorry if this is not the reddit to ask this in, if its not please point me to the right place. Thank you in advance!

Originally I had way too much removal in it and had to cut back drastically, putting in more creatures. However, I feel that I built the cube too much around my own personal taste of draft, which is pushing as much awesome creatures and removal as I can in. I am looking for some feedback on the cube itself, card suggestions or maybe some interesting themes people like to draft around. Any cards (especially non creature) at common that scream "build around me" would be awesome as well. Thanks in advance!

Then I have my HUGE double ringed Case-It binder that has everything else. This second binder is the one I am having the issue with. My standard stuff will be staying in the small binder, so the issue is how to split the large non-standard stuff up into two binders. I want the collection to be easy to look through not only for trades, but also for myself when I am deck building.My ideas are...1. Modern and Non-Modern binders. This was my first though, but as I sat down to start I realized some issues. The first being that some old bordered cards were legal in modern, and would continue to be so. This would make keeping the binders organized more of a pain than I really want to deal with. Also, if I keep old borders and new borders separate, I have playsets of things that are half and half, like birds of paradise. Gets sloppy.2. Organize by color, half in one binder, half in the other. The only issue with this is that no matter what if I want to take a binder with me for trading, I would need to bring BOTH binders. Not a huge issue, but kind of annoying considering the size of these things.3. I do NOT want to make a "valuable" and "non valuable" binder. I know this is ideal for trading, but for my own deck building and personal organization it feels sloppy and arbitrary based on today's prices. It would also probably end up with one binder being much larger than the other.So, what I want to know is, how do you guys organize your rares? Is it good for trading? Is it good for your own organization? What are some pros and cons. Aside solving my own problem, it would be cool to see how others present their rares.

I know there will be some problems, but would love some feedback on these. Let me know what you think!http://imgur.com/a/kZ8Ye
13gt5q	-30776	1353355837	magicTCG	Venser Theorycrafting	Spoilers below for those that haven't kept up with lore specifically about Venser.So this came out of a discussion I had with my partner the other night because she really likes Venser and I was trying to tease her, but it kind of started to ring true. What if Venser comes back as the new father of machines? We know WotC has said he is dead and that their characters stay dead, but are Phyrexians really "alive" to begin with? Here are some of the things I came up with off the top of my head to support this theory.* Venser lost his spark, giving it to Karn in to form of his heart. Only planeswalkers can... planeswalk. They can't take other people with them. It is then probable to say that they had to leave Venser's body on Mirrodin when they eventually GTFO'ed.* In the webcomic when Koth and Elspeth first find him, Venser is working on planar teleportation. In other words, allowing non-planeswalkers to planeswalk or send materials to other universes. However, he also states that the problems he needs to overcome to solve it would "take a lifetime" (http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/webcomics/Webcomic12_EN_Pt3_4.jpg)* The phyrexians would be incredibly interested in a device that would bring them to a fresh plane to corrupt.* Venser's body could be reanimated into a phyrexian form, taking his knowledge and putting it to use for themselves. A heart is a relatively simple mechanical device, so replace it on Venser theoretically wouldn't be too difficult.Its an interesting thought, and a clinging hope for people that want Venser back. But my last, and most convincing, piece of evidence is this...* Mark Rosewater loves Venser. He also loves poison counters. He also loves flicker effects. HOW COULD HE NOT BRING ALL OF THESE TOGETHER.I'll leave it at that for discussion.**EDIT:** Just because its been brought up, its been said in the books that bringing someone with you when walking when they don't have the spark will tear them apart in the blind eternities. Since Urza and some others did it pre-mending, this is probably something that changed during the mending.

But deprive people of interesting choices for too long, and they start making the obviously stupid choice just to feel alive. Another way to say it: we would rather do the wrong thing that we choose ourselves, than the right thing that is chosen for us. I think this explains a lot of behavior that otherwise doesn't make any sense, and it's why even the most benevolent central control can never make a good society, or even a good family.I think Ran is right here. People shoot themselves in the foot all the time, because the obvious answers are always laid out for them and they never really have to make any meaningful decisions of their own. I remember my friend having this irresistible urge to turn in a blank page for his final assignment in college. There are also continual cases of prominent people dying in off piste skiing accidents. You would think that people who run large organizations are intelligent enough to understand the risk, but they simply don't seem to care.If you're a young adult, you have to head to college, study some technical subject matter for a few years and stay stuck at the place where you did your internship. You can diverge from this path, by studying something non-technical (history, literature), dropping out or not going to college in the first place, but in practice you're generally speaking merely setting yourself up for an even less desirable outcome, that involves humiliating costumes and trying to sell products to people that they don't want. We spend a large period of our life making decisions where the correct answer is obvious. When most of your life consists of hearing some variant of "You're free to *not* do this, but your life will probably suck and you'll work in the movie theatre", like me and other students were told in some petty talk on the first day of college by the president of the university I attended, the urge to do just exactly that increases every day.We now have a society where the outcome of the "correct decision" becomes increasingly mediocre. First a high school degree was sufficient, then a bachelor's degree became required, now a master's degree is the new normal, followed by an unpaid internship. At the same time, because of the growing lack of alternatives, the pressure to obey increases and people gain a growing urge to take the wrong decision. When you do take the wrong decision, you suddenly find that you have relatively little left to lose. So we find cases like France, where teens now dress up in clown suits and start beating random people up. The most famous historical case is probably of Leopold and Loeb, two wealthy and intelligent 19 year olds who murdered some poor fourteen year old boy. These were kids who spoke five different languages fluently and had skipped multiple grades. We also have James Holmes, a guy who received his undergraduate degree in neuroscience with the highest honors. To declare "well, he went insane" is too simple of an explanation, it's really hard to combine insanity with the type of discipline college asks of young people. Instead I would argue, when your entire life path is laid out in front of you, the urge seems very big to fuck it up. If anything, these kind of actions seem very similar to what people do in an RPG they grow bored of. It's obvious what the game expects you to do, the story is laid out in front of you and you've read on the internet how the game progresses, so you decide to save the game and slaughter a bunch of people. Our response to a lack of interesting choices is surprisingly similar in both reality and video games.
2ku0dh	-30782	1414712437	accountt1234	Who is really powerful in our society?	When lefties talk about banksters, white privilege etcetera, there's an implicit accusation that we're dealing with powerful individuals. White heterosexual males are powerful, especially if they work for banks. The question I'm forced to ask is: How exactly does this power express itself? During World War II, Hitler had complete control over the fate of most of the Jews of Europe. Napeoleon spread laws we still use today. Genghis Khan had the power to change the global climate, through the number of people he slaughtered. Muhammed decided 1400 years ago what a billion people today are allowed to drink and how they should treat the genitals of their children.Today, the CEO of Mozilla can be kicked out, because he privately donated to a conservative political group. The leader of the free world can be sacked because of a blowjob. The spectrum of opinions that's tolerated in our nations today is quite limited. We might argue that OKCupid has power, because they forced him out, but that doesn't make sense either. If he had donated to a pro-gay marriage group, they would not have been able to force him out. In a hypothetical situation where OKCupid decided "We're going to try to get the CEO of Mozilla to step down because he wears ugly ties", they would not have had any success. Clearly, his vulnerability originated from the fact that he endorsed a political position (opposition to gay marriage) that is agreed by about half of all Americans, but no longer tolerable for America's political elite. Just as Christianity spread as a radical fringe movement at first, before becoming accepted, after which it become endorsed, before finally becoming mandatory, we're now at the stage where acceptance of gay marriage is demanded of our political elite, while rejection is still tolerated for the working classes.There is no single individual who can claim to have dethroned the CEO of Mozilla. The power lies in the series of values that govern the society. If Bill Gates came out tomorrow and spoke out against gay marriage, against vaccination, or against interracial marriage, that would be the end of Bill Gates. The same would happen if Bill Gates had declared that the bin Laden videos seem staged. He would maintain his billions, but he wouldn't be welcome on TV, he wouldn't be invited to TED conferences and he would be shunned by other billionaires. The power he would hold on to would be the power he inherited from his previous self, the man who endorsed all politically correct positions. Even this power is vulnerable however. Corporate customers would abandon Microsoft if Bill seemed politically incorrect, new monopoly lawsuits might take a big bite out of his wealth as well.Where does the power genuinely rest? It doesn't rest with the people, because the people's opinions are easily manipulated against their own interest. Power today rests with institutions. The nature of power is that it leaks, when you enforce your power, you're forced to sacrifice some of it. An emperor who sends a powerful general to fight an enemy risks giving birth to the next emperor in the process, a capitalist risks his employees improving upon the products that he sells. Similarly although the US government is very powerful, its power is leaky. When Bill Clinton becomes its PR spokesman, some of its power leaks to Bill, in the form of the millions of dollars he and his family earn from speeches. In Europe, VAT taxes aim to centralize power in the hands of government, but power leaks to those who understand how to commit VAT fraud. Power is less prone to leaking than it was in the past however. A government today has to fear power leaking less than a medieval family would. Those medieval families have seen their power leak, both to the families who worked for the government and the institute of the state itself, which became an entity separable from the monarch and his power.How is power gained today by individuals? This is accomplished by aligning oneself with the power structure. How does one align himself with the power structure? The power structure depends on enfranchisement. People have to feel they stand to lose from the disappearance of the power structure, else the power structure faces violent resistance from within. Thus the power structure is continually engaged in trying to make everyone dependent upon the power structure. The power structure spreads medicines that allow people to survive who would normally die, wellfare to feed people who would otherwise die, college degrees that render people employable, etcetera. The poor man doesn't want a revolution, as any disruption to his food stamps or insulin would guarantee his death. The rich man doesn't want a revolution, as his property rights would not be enforced. High taxes are upsetting to him, but at least he has some certainty, lawlessness would potentially lead to him having his property confiscated.The power structure has to enfranchise everyone, thus it endorses two contradictory messages: Liberty and equality. Importing impoverished ethnic minority groups into its borders empowers a government, because these demographics are most directly dependent upon government. Their health care costs are higher than they can afford themselves, their employment opportunities depend upon anti-discrimination laws, their houses are built by the government. At the same time, the higher social classes are enfranchised by government laws that render the working poor subservient to their institutionalized power. Government subsidies ensure that the working classes become forced to attend colleges, where they are taught the cultural values of the higher classes by people from higher class backgrounds. Government subsidies enable people to spend fortunes on medical care from select medical specialists, originating from the higher classes. Government laws and regulations are intentionally vague and obfuse, mandating the hiring of armies of legal experts, bureaucrats and compliance officers.The demographic that is most disenfranchised is the same practically everywhere: Healthy young working class men with high levels of testosterone. They have physical power, that government is forced to address one way or another. It is suppressed to some degree by sending them to college or petty jobs, where lack of physical activity renders them weak. They can also be intimidated through propaganda, threatening them, not with death, but with a lifetime of low social status, as any kind of criminal record renders them unemployable. It's very hard to enfranchise this demographic. Rather, government is generally forced to keep them sedated, which Western governments partially accomplish through free promiscuous sex as well as legal alcohol and cannabis. Societies where alcohol, cannabis and promiscuous sex are unavailable to most young men are far more prone to spontaneous outbursts of violence, as seen in the Middle East.Governments always have an inherent obligation to prevent any kind of human allegiance to informal networks of association. This is referred to under various terms in our society: Nepotism, racism, casteism, good ol' boy networks, etcera. Most frightening to government is when people form bottom-up self-defense groups, which government will always aim to suppress. This is partially accomplished by separating people from their family. Government housing projects encourage families to separate, as well as encouraging people from different social classes to live nearby one another. Colleges have the effect of encouraging migration of children away from their parents. Generally speaking however, governments dissolve traditional networks of loyalty through the promotion of secularization and anti-discrimination laws. When governments fail at this, we end up with a society like Sicily, when government succeeds, a society like the Netherlands is born.

2kxsi7	-30782	1414801866	accountt1234	Why I am anti-science (reprise)	The scientific mentality is that of men who don't seek to discover mystery, but rather, to solve mysteries. Scientists believe in the value of consensus over reality. They're interested in having a stable worldview, where everything is predictable. Uncertainty frightens them.The exact opposite of the scientist is the occultist. The occultist isn't interested in arriving at correct answers, he is interested in giving birth to new questions. The scientists desires to discover universal truths, applicable to the entire world, occultists are interested in questions to which humans will never agree.Science and occultism have been at war with each other for much of recorded history, under differing names. Christians verses witches, heretics, pagans and satanists, Mu'tazila verses Sufis, and so forth. Atheists laugh at pagans, because they come up with the stuff they believe themselves, but fail to understand the point, that our belief itself gives power to ideas.Scientists believe there to be a single objective reality, but this is a self-fulfilling prophecy, when we consider the idea that reality itself is a product of human consensus and the universe merely takes on shape according to our observations and interpretations. On issues where humans can't come to an agreement on what is supposed to have happened, science is never able give a satisfying answer (Jesus' life, the JFK assassination, the health effects of cell phone radiation).My ideal world is one where nothing is certain to us. A world where monsters lure in the depths of the waters, the forest is a place where witches live, caves extend for miles under our feet and house dragons. Ideally we would all be illiterate and all human knowledge would be lost.Most men wish to enlighten the world. I wish to throw the world into another age of darkness.
2l17pu	-30782	1414896376	accountt1234	How I really feel about Ebola	The other night I watched a mouse be chased by a cat. I didn't want the cat to catch the mouse. I'd feel sorry for the mouse. At the same time, I don't want to live in a world where cats never manage to catch any mice. The world would be inherited by mice, as nothing could stop them from overpopulating the world, until all biological matter consists of either mice or food for mice.My grandfather was depressed before he died. He had lived a full life and didn't see any reason to go on living. It didn't take long afterwards, until he caught an infection that spread throughout his bloodstream and rapidly led to his death. I was sad and I mourned. At the same time, despite my personal loss, I did not have to cry for my grandfather, it was my own loss that led to sadness. It's possible for a life to be more or less complete. This is certainly possible at age eighty, but it can be true at earlier ages as well. Not every life serves the same purpose and so it's possible for a life to be complete at an early age, even in your mid twenties.We tend to look at death like burning a painting, but I would look at it more as shutting down a computer game. Nothing has ceased to exist, it has simply disappeared off the stage. Not everything can play at the same time, and some thing have to disapppear (Big.Fat.Sexy.Butts.Part.3.XXX.1024.HD.avi) for others to be able to appear (The_History_of_Russian_Liturgical_Music_2014_Assignment.docx).All life has intrinsic value, but at the same time, all value is relative. Both milk and yoghurt are valuable, but giving birth to the latter requires sacrificing some of the previous. A human life in our society can only exist due to the non-existence of other life. It is thanks to the death of entire ecosystems arond the whole world that the Netherlands can house sixteen million people. As humans, we appropriate from non-human species in the present, as well as from generations of humans born in the future.If some alien species had invaded our planet and decided to exterminate us so that they can grow further, we would resist and declare that our lives have value too. That's exactly how Martha, the world's last passenger pigeon felt when she died alone in a zoo. That's exactly how Truganini felt, when she watched her race go extinct after the British had landed. It's also exactly how the last animals in the remaining forest of Nigeria must feel.As humans, we have destroyed the ancient forests of Europe to make way for our agriculture. Today the same happens in Liberia, Nigeria and other countries, where humans colonize the forest to expand their population. The tropical forests of Africa are a much tougher nut to crack than the temperate forests of Europe however. They harbor a much wider range of species that European forests did, with the risk of the spread of disease infinitely higher as a result. It's possible to hold contradictory emotions about the same event. I can miss my grandfather, yet look at the plight he was in, and accept that he was ultimately better off. I can look at the drug-addicted orphans living in the slum of West Point in Monrovia, or the prostitutes doing their business in shacks with blood on the walls and accept that they will ultimately be better off. West point is not much different from the average nursing home you'll visit here in my country. Nobody is allowed to leave, everyone is mentally insane and gets through the day by being high on drugs and everything smells like urine. I've watched a lot of people vomit up blood, abandoned by all who were dear to them. I don't want them to suffer. At the same time, I don't want to live in a world where everything is either human or human-food, where all life is given the nutrients needed to survive in exchange for loyalty towards abstract theoretical concepts like "human rights", "freedom" and "equality".I can look at my own country and accept that what we produce is not better than what could exist in our absence. We sit in front of a screen in a room and write bits of code, before heading back to another room somewhere else and staring at another screen, until we go to bed. Sometimes we have a holiday season and we all dress up in orange and drink beverages made of fermented cereal, while watching men kick around a ball on our screens. Some of us are born with a gaping hole between our legs. We spend our days applying expensive powdery substances to our faces and wait impatiently for someone to show up who is dumb enough to sacrifice most of his monthly computer-stare reward in exchange for sole access to the magical gaping hole. The higher the particular human specimen's computer-stare reward is, the more we feel we have accomplished something in life. When we die, we expect to see a high score, where the number of computer-stare points we have converted into jewelry and face-powder is forever registered next to our username, ideally just above that bitch from high school.I fail to see how the whole product we have created is something that's worth sacrificing a forest for, let alone a beaver dam. The obvious question then becomes: "So why don't you just kill yourself?" I think that's not a realistic solution. I don't value human life as absurdly high as most people do, not even my own life. I'm not expecting however for there to be a plot of land in Brazil that won't be cut down, merely because I don't have to be fed. We have a problem, and that problem is the fact that the world we have created has no genuine added value over the world we destroyed in the process of giving birth to it. It has to go away and ebola is probably the best solution to it. I hope it strike here soon.

2ls4f3	-30782	1415557791	DarkFuturology	The birth of a techno-aristocracy and the return of class conflict	You already know where this is going, we've all thought about this at some point. There's a shrinking elite of people who are growing wealthier and wealthier, while automation has ensured that they no longer need most of us. We're now living in a society where we spend our days serving food to each other and teaching each other knowledge that we'll never put to practical use, but at some point the façade -No, you really don't need a four year college degree to be a telemarketer- can't be kept up any longer and disruptive change has to occur. If we don't prepare ourselves, most of us will be discarded like a dirty tissue."But really, they're such nice people! Mr. Zuckerberg looks like a regular nice guy, if the worst thing happens he'll simply pay half of us to dig ditches and the other half to fill them again" Well, besides the fact that every billionaire who doesn't completely shun the spotlights has a PR team behind him, Mark "they trust me, dumb fucks" Zuckerberg doesn't even have to be out to turn you into a modern day serf.The question you have to ask yourself is: How did people conquer the world? The answer in most cases was: By accident. When you are powerful, you are a threat to others. The only real solution you're left with is growth. Rome was forced to perpetually expand, because it was constantly surrounded by people who posed a threat. The Etruscans, the Latins, the Carthaginians, etcetera. These people had to be integrated in the empire. Had Rome gone another route, Rome would have been integrated by one of these competing groups.Ceasar conquered Rome, because he feared he would be prosecuted if he entered Rome without immunity. In our age, Berlusconi entered politics, because he feared the alternative was going to prison. Zuckerberg, Gates and others did not set out to become billionaires, it simply happened to them. As your company grows, your financial obligations increase, which require you to continue growing. In addition, no real stable niche exists other than world conquest. Facebook could not coexist with Myspace, Friendster, Hyves, Vampirefreaks and Xanga, one had to assimilate or starve the others.Until recently, this eat or be eaten mentality did not have to concern us, because being eaten was a tolerable fate. If your store is bought out, you may continue as a franchise manager. You're not dismantled. Today however, very few of us are really needed. We see this in the form of rising unemployment rates, rising college attendance, stagnant wages and various other symptoms. Many of us are artificially kept busy, through government subsidies towards healthcare and education, low minimum wages and other measures. The solution generally proposed to this convergence of problems is a basic income. It's not a bad idea, it's a case of trying to make the best of a horrifying situation. Ignoring for a moment the inevitable existential crisis humans face when spending their entire lives without any genuinely meaningful tasks to complete, where all of life consists of the choice between different entertainment products, the question we're faced with is: Who's going to pay for it?Most of our global economy today consists of industry and services. This is where money is made. Agriculture is 5,9 percent of the global economy, natural resources are 5,7 percent. The government can place a big tax on land ownership, used to provide a basic income to us, the teeming masses. For countries with plenty of fertile soil and natural resources, like Papua New Guinea and Equatorial Guinea, this may delay disaster. But what about countries mostly dependent on services and industry? Are these countries going to introduce a new "social media tax"? Are they simply going to tax any sort of remaining wealth? We know how this ends. We've seen it in [France](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27602312). A 75% tax rate on income above one million Euro meant that the rich fled the country, leaving the country with a 14 billion dollar gap between expected and realized income. The world's upper class is no longer bound by borders.Nations will inevitably chase away or eradicate their upper classes, because those rich who flee increase the tax burden those who are left will have to carry. In practice, countries dependent on service industries have just one real option: Join the race to the bottom. The race to the bottom means that governments will reduce taxes on dividend, corporate income taxes, inheritance taxes, eliminate wealth taxes and get rid of minimum wages and social safety nets. This is all meant in an effort to get a stateless global upper class to settle down in their particular tax district.Another race to the bottom is in the form of dirty energy. Countries that pursue clean energy end up raising their electricity costs, ensuring that manufacturing and energy-intensive data projects simply move to another country. The US natural gas boom is leading European manufacturing companies to [move](http://www.ibtimes.com/natural-gas-boom-attracting-manufacturing-us-overseas-take-advantage-cheaper-fuel-1582512) to the US.Perhaps some billionaires are altruisitic and willing to join the middle class. In exchange the entire nation will kiss their boots and they will be able to continue to live surrounded by their childhood friends. We already know that some, like Facebook billionaire Eduardo Sardin, don't feel like playing along voluntatily. We also know that companies don't have the opportunity to be altruistic. Companies have to dodge taxes, just to survive.We don't know how this unfolds, because it has never occurred before. We've never lived in a society where most humans are obsolete. We've had eras of enormous wealth inequality before, but these were still times when humans had the ability to sell their labor. Increased productivity per worker was accompanied by increased demand. Thus, although 1 employee could now produce as many suits as ten employees, we now wanted more suits, so disaster was avoided. This solution began to falter in the second half of the 20th century, when employees increasingly began to serve to artificially increase demand for a particular product, leading to the now pervasive sales jobs. It's clear that we're now entering an era where demand can not really increase much further. We've got a TV and a smoke detector in every room, a different tie for every day of the week and such a wide variety of food in our supermarket that we will never taste more than a fraction. Demand is mostly growing in things that we don't actually want. Consider the rise in health care as a sector of the economy, now employing ten percent of the population. Surely nobody would suggest that future unemployment should be adressed by ensuring that more people start suffering chronic illness? Even if so, at some point the elderly will pursue euthanasia, rather than spending the last years of their lives as blind, deaf diabetic "job creators".The "luddite fallacy" can no longer be considered a fallacy. The problem we face now is increasingly similar to the scenario that Marx anticipated. A growing mass of people are without wealth and dependent on selling their labor. At the same time, a shrinking elite is no longer capable of keeping the working masses sedated with the spoils of of other workers. Lenin's "labor aristocrats", first world workers kept loyal to the status quo by being handed some of the spoils of third world exploitation, have increasingly little left to lose. [Bill Gates](https://news.yahoo.com/bill-gates-yes-robots-really-jobs-180449215.html) recent suggestion that governments should "beg" corporations to keep workers employed is a desperate plea, from a man fearful of the inevitable return of class conflict.

2lwqji	-30782	1415661817	accountt1234	Why you should fear the computer	A recurring theme in my writings is the idea that collapse is the best option we have, because every other possible outcome of our present situation is worse. We've got a bunch of problems in our society that all have the same solution, but it's a solution that we don't really like. This is what I would like to look at today.Let's start with the issue of peak oil. We know that cheap oil is a thing of the past, it remains to be seen whether our economy is capable of sustaining the exploitation of more expensive oil, like shale oil. This would lead to collapse, but a large amount of our oil consumption is effectively optional, it doesn't necessarily have to exist in the future. This is especially true of the [45% of US oil consumption that is for personal transportation.](http://www.americanenergyindependence.com/fuels.aspx)We have to ask ourselves where this is spent and the answer is that much of it is increasingly obsolete. Why do you have to travel to an office to sit behind a computer? Why do you have to travel to the supermarket to pick the products you want to eat? Why do you have to travel to college, to hear your professor talk? You don't really have to do any of those things.This is dangerous, because humans are inherently lazy creatures. We evolved to avoid unnecessary energy expenditure. We need to be forced by our environment to do stuff, we lack intrinsic motivation. Our ancestors had direct extrinsic motivation. If you don't save food for winter, you get hungry and die. If you don't build shelter, you first start feeling uncomfortable, but eventually you die.Even today, we mostly deal with extrinsic motivation, in the form of social contact. If you lose your job, your girlfriend dumps you. If you lose your figure, your boyfriend dumps you. People who lack such social relationships tend to accomplish very little, because they have very little extrinsic motivation left. This is one reason loneliness is deadly: The motive to do anything begins to disappear. It's also why pets are so important. Pets create obligations, which lead to action, which leads to order.Anyone today who promisis to make anything "easier" for you is very dangerous, because he takes away what little extrinsic motivation we have left. I refer to such people as "pencil-dicked STEM-nerds" and ideally we would line them all up against a wall and execute them. We don't need Amazon.com to deliver products to our doorstep by drone. It's better for us to visit the supermarket and buy our own instant noodles. It's also better for us to buy ingredients for real meals, and it's also better for there to be no supermarket and for us to spend our weekend forced to travel to different stores to gather ingredients. Ideally the stores would not exist either and we would be forced to gather our food in the wild.Like its predecessor, the television, the computer doesn't supplement, it replaces. It replaces things we only begin to value after we lost them. When was the last time you played Dungeons and Dragons or monopoly with someone? Laugh all you want, but the social contact is more valuable than the quality of entertainment itself. Dungeons and Dragons is like sex in this regard: Crude, it's imperfect, awkward (especially if someone walks in on you!), prone to going entirely wrong, best when improvised and more valuable than any comparable activity.When it came out, Dungeons and Dragons represented a painful strike back against the beast, comparable in symbolic value to the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Here are the people most vulnerable to isolation and being lost to technology, invited back into the real world. How much of our time do we spend today, talking to each other face to face? Technology lost control over what should have been easy territory to defend, the evening hours of teenage boys living in an environment that doesn't really want them. It was successful, because the idea was so good.We could call Dungeons and Dragons a case of using the master's tools to dismantle the master's house, but I would disagree. Rather, the alternative that Dungeons and Dragons competes with, the virtual worlds of Skyrim and World of Warcraft and other electronic games, represents a case of the master using YOUR tools against you. The computer didn't come up with Dragons or with skill points, or with Goblins or with Dwarves, our ancestors did. These appealed to them for the same reason they appeal to us. When you design a video game, you're a slave working for your master. You're proud of your work, but the whip you produced, despite being gorgeous, is ultimately used to scald your own back. It's inevitable that children will end up alone and playing your games, in an effort to escape the real world.This isn't just true for video games programmers. Who still bothers going to the local theater to be entertained? I can hardly think of anyone. We watch movies, produced by an elite minority of actors and directors located in a particular part of California. How many social media specialists, object oriented PHP developers, sales professionals and corporate lawyers would rather be comedians, costume designers, dancers and actors? There are plenty, but the opposite, a comedian who want to be a social media specialists is relatively rare. Technology forced us to spend our days dealing with abstractions, because one man can now entertain as many people as a hundred could a century ago. There are hardly any comedians, costume designers, dancers and actors who will recognize technology as the threat it poses to everything they hold sacred however.The computer isn't done ruining our lives, because the next stage is now upon us. With oil depletion at hand, all obsolete human activities are going to be eradicated, because they can simply no longer be sustained. You won't visit the supermarket, as you will order your food online and it will be delivered to you. College is becoming unaffordable, so the solution is found in cheap colleges that can be attended online. You won't go to the office, you'll work at home, from behind your computer. You can't afford the cost of gasoline, your employer can't afford the computer, coffee machine, office building, toilet paper and other facilities you would need if you would work at his place. You probably already order most of your clothes online, so shopping itself is becoming a thing of the past.We replace education, which is a simulacrum of work, with e-learning, which is a simulacrum of education. Your entire life will eventually consist of interaction with simulacrums. Nobody seems to question the benefit of this, everyone pretends this is some sort of voluntary development we undergo. In reality, there won't *be* any jobs that require you to leave your home, or colleges you can afford to attend that will require you to get out of your bed. Every technological development that is at first voluntary eventually becomes mandatory, or at the very least takes away abilities you once had. I don't have Facebook, I don't have a car and I don't have a cell phone, but it comes at the cost of some degree of isolation. So, what do you expect will be left? If you want a picture of the future, imagine sitting in front of a computer, forever.

2lzjzz	-30782	1415729795	accountt1234	What Tolkien can teach us about ourselves.	The world Tolkien gave birth to is one where technology does not progress beyond the iron age. The exception of course is Mordor, where the industrial revolution takes place. Mordor is [inspired](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/19/how-the-west-midlands-black-country-inspired-tolkien-lord-of-the-rings) by Tolkien having witnessed the destruction of the natural landscape in his own childhood environment. Tolkien was a critic of modernity and industrialization and did not make a secret of it. In Lord of the Rings, the world is stuck in the iron age, because the races of Middle Earth are simply [not evil enough](http://www.reddit.com/r/lordoftherings/comments/1aryha/can_someone_please_explain_why_technology_in_the/c908kzc) for the world to advance any further technologically. Had the fellowship of the ring failed, technological progress would have spread further. Even in the transition to the Iron age, people noticed that the world was gowing uglier, as people saw the transition to iron as an impoverishment. Hesiod wrote: "And I wish that I were not part of [this] generation of men, but had died before it came, or been born afterward. For here now is the age of iron." Tolkien's writings fit in with the traditionalist position that the world is ultimately shaped by our moral inclination. If we are prone to evil, then the world itself becomes miserable. Evil is ugly and so as we engage in evil, the world around us becomes ugly. It is a specific type of ugliness, not the one we identify most readily, of an unfortunate birth mark or even a victim of burns. The ugliness we find in our world as a result of our actions is the product of an absence of beauty. It is a sterile type of ugliness, the type of ugliness of a porn star with blonde hair and silicone breasts. It is disgusting, in the same way a Mars candy bar is to anyone who has tasted the fruits of nature.We are evil, because we are lacking in the goodness our power asks from us. Evil is a reversion to a more default, banal state of man, it is morality without refinement. Evil is not a man flying an airplane into a skyscraper, it is a woman hugging and petting her deformed Chihuahua with bulging eyeballs. The Holocaust was not caused by Hitler's perverted sense of moral purity, it was caused by widespread indifference. To prevent a single person's death merely required *someone* at some point in the vast logistical chain to say *no*. It could have been the men around Hitler, it could have been someone working at the registration system where people's ethnicity is registered, it could have been the person tasked with rounding up the victims, the person tasked with operating the trains, the person tasked with guarding the camp or the person manning the gas chambers. Any single point in the logistical system could have failed if someone chose the difficult route and it would have been enough to prevent numerous deaths. The reason any people survived at all is because there were logistical points where failure to obey occurred. The reason so many people died nonetheless was because of the widespread indifference that characterizes us as human beings.The ugliness and evil we produce is ultimately the product of our widespread compliance. The global industrial economy has just one goal, the exploitation of all available energy. It is destroying something within decades that took billions of years to create. The passenger pigeon evolved after 3.5 billion years of evolution, but was exterminated within decades. Nazi Germany was a foreshadowing, it was evil translated into terms comprehensible for humans. It was an industrial death machine for humans, an analogy for the global industrial death machine that is eradicating all life on Earth.We are all aware that our civilization is on the road towards global destruction, this is no longer disputed. As the first nuclear bombs were built, any man could understand that soon the press of a button would be capable of making our planet uninhabitable for generations to come. Today we are all aware that our civilization is on the path towards eradicating the last remnants of the natural world. We're stuck in a global logistical chain that aims to eradicate everything. A third of the world's arable land has been lost since 1960. The economy creates a global wasteland, where nothing can survive.Every single one of us is capable of causing financial destruction far in excess of anything we could ever contribute to the economy. A Boeing 747 is worth more to the economy than its pilot will ever make in his lifetime. A single employee in Belgium shut down a nuclear reactor through sabotage for months. Any further sabotage of the electricity supply could bring Belgium to an economic standstill. All that is necessary is for us to say no and this monster can be brought to its knees.We don't need 51% of the population to recognize that industrial civilization is ahead of schedule for its ultimate goal of the extinction of all life on Earth. We need a minority, a fraction of the population to cast aside its indifference and give birth to an island of goodness in an ocean of indifference. It can be accomplished and everyone can participate, from hunter-gatherers in the Amazon to college students in China. Every further layer of complexity added merely makes Sauron's tower more vulnerable, and at this point, all it really needs is just a gentle nudge. We can be that nudge.

The first question that has to be asked, before all others right now is: Who the fuck cares? People are offended that others care more about Kim Kardashian's fat butt than about pencil-dicked STEM-nerds landing a robot on a comet on the other side of the solar system. I think it is completely justified for people to be more interested in Kim Kardashian's butt than in some space probe, for reasons I will outline below:**Unlike the Rosetta mission, Kim Kardashian's fat butt will actually affect you.** It is likely to spread sexually transmittable disease throughout the population. If you have a habit of exchanging bodily fluids with gangster rappers and similar figures, it is more directly relevant to you than the comet, as unlike the comet, it poses a genuine risk to your life expectancy. Unlike the comet, it harbors a variety of different forms of life. It is likely to harbor millions of lactobacilli, propionobacteria, it might very well harbor staphylococcus epidermis. It can sustain all these different germs. More importantly, so can your fat butt. The comet doesn't harbor anything. Anything that might have survived the journey from Earth to the comet would certainly die there. Nothing survives there, the comet is scorched by the sun. The comet doesn't affect you. You can't smell it, you can't touch it, you can't stand on it. You can do all of the prior three with the other big object that received a lot of media attention lately, if you're willing to invest some effort into it. If someone claimed the comet does not even exist, you would have no way of proving the opposite to them. They can show you pictures of the dead rock, but anyone could make those on his computer. Here's the thing you don't seem to get. Humans are irrelevant in space. The computers were willing to take some of us with them to the moon, but after that, our business in space was over. We're heavy, we're expensive, we're sensitive to the radiation in space. We have no business in space. We're given computer signals, from a machine that tells us what it happens to see on a particular spot on the surface. You don't see anything real. You see a different few photons radiated out of your computer screen, based on the server of some other computer, which if we go all the way through the chain of communication bases itself on what it was told by a machine that was sent out into space.  You're fed science-fiction scenarios about space, in an effort to get you excited about it, but there's nothing to be excited about, because you're not going into space. Perhaps the Chinese might set some people on the moon to prove they can do the same thing as the Americans, but after that, it's over. Nobody can afford to send people out into space. Europe can't afford to keep Greek children from fainting during gym lessons from lack of food, do you think we're going to Mars? That era is over. A handful of people were lucky and got to jump around for a bit on the moon in special suits, the rest of us got to see grainy video footage of it. Sending humans into space is dangerous to their health, costly and inefficient. Computers are taking over from here. There won't be humans landing on comets, or humans mining asteroids. There's no need for us there, artificial intelligence can do it much cheaper and safer than we can. You're going to sit on Earth and the computer is going out there showing you its holiday pictures. You don't like watching your own friends show off their holiday pictures, why do you suddenly care about the pictures a computer sends you?What if those thousand people spent the last ten years traveling through the Amazon rainforest? Wouldn't they have benefitted more? You want to see a moon landscape? Save our fossil fuels and ignore space, travel to the nearest desert. Outer space is like a desert but with less colour. Except the desert will surprise you with the occasional camel or even an oasis. Outer space won't. It will bore you to tears after a week.There isn't jack shit out there that's worth exploring anyway. I've seen bugs show up in my bedroom that are more interesting than that piece of rock. I've seen anthills here in my country that I could stare at for hours. How long do you think it would take you to grow bored of a giant grey piece of rock that smells like rotten eggs? Yes, that's right, it smells like [rotten eggs and cat urine](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn26447-comet-stinks-of-rotten-eggs-and-cat-wee-finds-rosetta.html). Why should we be excited about a dead rock that smells like the refrigerator of a crazy cat lady? This comet is the very opposite of life. It's static and sterile. It looks like a test object God put into an alpha version of the universe that was never removed. It is interesting in the same way an abstract painting left entirely blank is. It reminds us of how lucky we are at home."But it tells us more about the universe!" Us. You said it right. It increases our collective knowledge. Who cares about our collective knowledge? Your individual knowledge of space is probably embarrassingly low. Could you navigate a ship using the stars at night? Chances are the light pollution of thousands of STEM-nerds in your neighborhood sitting behind computers at night reading about a dead rock makes you incapable of even seeing the stars. If we find out tomorrow that the robot claims the comet smells more like donkey urine than like cat urine and all scientific theories are thrown into disarray as a result, does it matter? Step on a mushroom in your local park and you wouldn't be able to tell me what you just killed, it doesn't matter to you. You specialized in a specific brand of STEM-nerdism and feel a sense of power when its control over nature is increased, any other branch is like a rivaling tribe competing for its own share of government subsidies and student tuition. Outer space is like going out of bounds in a poorly programmed video game. You can walk on forever, but you're not going to encounter anything particularly meaningful. Nobody put any effort into putting anything interesting out there, the programmer figured you'd find out there's nothing there and move back. How many more billions are we going to spend walking out of bounds? Freud claimed that we have a death drive, the desire to explore the absence of life, to pursue self-destruction and return to the inorganic. There are more exciting ways to go about it than to stare at pictures of a rock that smells like a cat pissed on it, a smell we will never even smell, because even if we sent a human he'd have to be protected against the vacuum. Visit an underground cave instead. How many people could we have sent out there to explore underground caves, for the budget we have spent on building a robot that sends pictures of a dead rock to STEM-nerds back on Earth?Fuck that rock.

2n64s9	-30782	1416755583	accountt1234	The resurgence of the wild man	Nobody probably wants to hear what I'm going to say today, the perspective I wish to deliver here is effectively unique and should in all likelihood offend everyone. We know that humans are subject to the same forces of evolution that all other animals are subject to. There is no God who made humans exempt from Darwinian selection. Thus, we would expect different environmental conditions to lead to different outcomes.Animals respond visibly to domestication, something that can happen within a few generations. When the fox was domesticated, his entire appearance changed. The ears become floppy, his coat color brighter, he raised his tail and enters heat six months rather than annually. The same thing happened to wolves, to produce dogs.Domesticated animals show certain signs that are universal. The skull is generally smaller, the brain is smaller, the jaw is smaller, while the body is less muscular and often less hairy as well. We can look at our own species and notice that we display signs of domestication. We hardly have any hair, we're physically weak, our jaws are small (which is concealed in men through our beards), while our eyes skin and hair have often lost their dark pigment.Most importantly perhaps, we can compare our ancestors exposure to testosterone, to the exposure to testosterone of our own people. Digit ratios are known to be a good indicator of prenatal testosterone exposure. What we find is that in Neanderthals, non-human apes and premodern humans the digit ratios 2d:4d are far more masculine than in modern humans.1 Specifcally, out of 10.000 randomly chosen humans, only 19 will have a digit ratio as low or lower than the average Neanderthal.Where it gets controversial, is when we compare modern human races. As I explained earlier, the digit ratios are used as an indicator of prenatal testosterone exposure, but there is a strong difference between human races as well. Han Chinese boys on average have a ratio that is more feminine than the ratio of Jamaican girls.2 Even more interesting perhaps, is that feminist activist women also show a more masculine 2d:4d digit ratio.3What we thus find, is that the feminists are more similar to primitive women, as they existed before the Neolithic revolution. Women back then had a more active role within society and were more independent. If we look at women who have a more masculine digit ratio today, we find that they are more independent too. As an example, looking at modern black mothers, we find that they often take care of their children by themselves.Looking at my own family, I find that my mother has a relatively masculine/primitive digit ratio. When she writes a letter, people assume she is a man. My own digit ratio is very primitive as well, at 0.9504 on my left hand, compared to the 0.98 average for adult white men. When we look at people with a primitive digit ratio, we find that they tend to perform relatively poorly in modern society. Looking at women with a primitive digit ratio, studies find that they are relatively more promiscuous.4 When we look at men in academia, we find that their digit ratios are actually feminized.5 The reason for this would be because academia requires men to be docile and obedient. It takes years to earn any sort of salary you can live off, and you're continually told what to do by your superiors.On a global level, we find that successful populations appear to be less masculine than the less successful populations. The Ainu are one of the few Asian ethnic groups capable of growing strong full beards. They have been displaced by the modern day Japanese, who invaded the island from Korea. Whereas the Ainu are strong, masculine and virile, the modern day Japanese are more passive.In Indonesia, we find a similar story. The most masculine people you will find in Indonesia are the Papuans. They are a Melanesian ethnic group. The Moluccans are an Indonesian ethnic group who are originally descended from Melanesians as well. However, they were later dominated by the more civilized and less masculine Austronesians, to whom the modern day Javanese belong as well. Thus, today they are a mixture of both groups.You might not be convinced of the difference in masculinity between populations, but there is sufficient evidence.6 Adrenal research has been done and shows that Asian men's testicles weigh about a third less than the testicles of Caucasian men. In addition, lower levels of dehydrotestosterone appears to be what makes Asian men less able to grow full beards. If we look at Asian women, we find the hyperfemininity as well. Japanese women for example raise the pitch of their voices when speaking to their husbands.###The resurgence of the wild manGaia doesn't want her children to be domesticated, she wants us to be wild and free. The natural inclination of humans is to pursue wildness and freedom. Human wildness is always under threat. When we look at Indonesia, we find that the Papuans have their land colonized by Javanese Indonesians. The Papuans enjoy living like tribal people do. Violence is endemic, people wear little clothing, humans hunt and gather for food. The immigrants on the other hand, attempt to spread civilization.Because the wild humans have suffered such a long losing streak, there is a stigma on being primitive. Japanese people for example tend to see hairiness as bad. You won't find very many people self-identify as wild and primitive. Violence, destruction and theft is seen by modern people as terrifying and shameful. Primitive people see it as part of the natural cycle of life. By being violent and destructive to each other, we ensure that we can continue to live as hunter-gatherers, instead of ending up working in a cubicle as a social media specialist or an object oriented PHP programmer.Luckily, the wild man is resurging. In Europe and the United States, domestication is being weeded out. The domesticated people spend until their late twenties studying for their PHD, while the primitive people reproduce. When civilization collapses, the wild man will see his winning streak. While domesticated people will sit inside their cubicles, convinced that their salary will buy them food because the talking head on TV told them there is nothing to worry about, the wild men will plunder and conquer the essentials to survive. Humans will not have to obey the dictates of some petty supervisor any longer, instead, they will carve out their own direction in life. Many will die, some of them simply because they would rather be dead than free. They are natural born social media specialists, slavery is in their genes. Some will take pleasure in life having meaning again, the struggle for survival brings them joy. To them belongs the future.###References1 - http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2010/11/01/rspb.2010.17402 - http://lib.gen.in/next/MTAuMTAxNi9qLmVhcmxodW1kZXYuMjAwNC4wNi4wMDQ=/10.1016_j.earlhumdev.2004.06.004.pdf3 - http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01011/abstract4 - Clard, AP (2004).

Any accounts registered with his password, his username or his IP address are automatically banned. Unfortunately, this has not been enough to keep him away from this website.My new suggestion to keep him away is as following: Make a video of yourself getting pegged and send it to him through a PM. Also post it on /r/peggingforequality. Accountt1234, as a vicious mysogynist and homophobe, would be so disgusted by seeing this display of mutual love and understanding between genders and abilition of male privilege, that his rage would force him to stop using Reddit. This is my proposed final solution against the accountt1234 problem.Fellow intellectuals, get busy, videotape yourself getting pegged today! Ideally, videotape yourself while getting pegged by a big-strong beautiful plus-sized independent woman of colour, who owns her sexuality. Make sure that you apologize for your white privilege every time she smacks you on your butt. This will be Kryptonite against the accountt1234 menace.For equality,~~/u/accountt12~~ err /u/myohmywtf, the Reddit user who is 100% proven not to be accountt1234.

2nboe6	-30782	1416878695	ranprieur	Consensus reality and veganism	Ran Prieur has brought this idea up a bunch of times, the last time I remember was 9/11, where he proposed that the evidence on 9/11 is inconclusive, simply because we as a society can't agree on what is supposed to have happened that day. Reality simply adapts to what we dictate, so when there's no consensus, there's no answer.These are my own words, Ran said it more elegantly, but I've toyed with this idea a lot. The case where I keep encountering it is diet. We don't agree as a society on what a healthy diet is supposed to look like, so there's still no scientific consensus on the topic.Let's take the seemingy simple question of whether humans benefit from meat in their diet. We can all agree that the modern day processed meat from animals given antibiotics and kept in sterile cages deprived of sunlight and exercise is unhealthy. When it comes to animals that live a healthy life, we diverge, with one group proclaiming that we need meat in our diet for genuine health, while the other group disputes this.I've read about this subject for years, and frankly, I still don't know. I'm not even one inch further.Let's just go over some of the questions for now.Do we need animal products for vitamin B12? Well, natural manure contains vitamin B12 and organic food may contain some B12, so that may or may not be enough to avoid deficiency. In addition, some bacteria in our mouth may or may not produce vitamin B12. Anyone who claims he can give you the definitive answer here is lying. We don't know if we really need B12 from animals, but in practice we just try to make sure the vegans take a supplement.Then we can look at Omega 3 fatty acids. Humans can convert ALA to EPA and DHA, but most people get most of it from their diet. Do vegans convert enough of it? We don't know. They tend to have less of it, but is this genuinely problematic? We don't know. There have been authors who claimed that humans could easily get enough DHA simply on a vegan diet. Again, we don't really know.To show the opposite side for a moment, we've got plenty of evidence on the other side, suggesting that we should really absolutely avoid meat in our diet. Carnitine in meat may lead to the formation of atherosclerosis. There's also quite strong evidence that Neu5Gc, found in animal products, leads to inflammatory disorders and cancer in humans.But then to move back to the other side, we can also look at taurine and creatine and see that these products found in animal products seem to have quite a positive effect on our health. Vegetarians and vegans given creatine improve their mental performance on tests, whereas omnivores don't. Taurine on the other hand seems to increase their cardiovascular health.I can spend nights reading about this, without getting any further. Of course to make matters worse, the answer to the question "What is healthy?" doesn't automatically answer the question "What should we eat?". We've got seven billion people walking around today, if they all want to eat meat, it's going to have to come from animals stuck in tiny cages. If we need meat in our diet because early protohumans in the Sahel got their meat from animal carcasses they could reach before other animals thanks to our bipedalism, but for us to raise animals ourselves and kill them is a depravity of cosmic proportions, we've got a whole new problem.Of course on the other hand, there are questions where humans don't agree with each other, but where the answer nonetheless seems very obvious to me. Evolution for example, you don't need a degree in biology to understand that the evidence overwhelmingly points towards humans having evolved from previous species.

2nbymj	-30782	1416884413	DarkFuturology	This kills the futurologist	(Sorry if you don't like my title) This text is like Kryptonite to techno-optimism:**from *The End of Empire*, p.154-156**------------------Life is community. Community is biological. Our innate experience of natural morality is a biological feeling. It is not an intellectualization or romanticism. To be kind, helpful, sharing, and joyful is a natural state that comes right out of our cellular existence. That sense of unity and positivity is the way the universe works. No matter how damaged any of us have been by the culture of empire, almost everyone retains at least some shred of this positive sensibility. The personal experience of security, solidarity, sharing and love is the experience of beauty just as is a walk through an undamaged forest or sitting on a remote beach.With the loss of our free roaming natural life and direct relationship with the life of the cosmos came an all-enveloping attack upon the beauty of our lives and the earth. The beauty of our lives, the song, the dance, the direct participation in creation suffered, along with the beauty of the earth's body, the forest, the sparkling stream, the song of the bird and the call of the animals. The diseased human culture produced the ugliness of the injured and bleeding ecology, the eroding and withering life of the land and the visual ugliness of the modern city where the homeless huddle in cold doorways of architectural boxes and elites of the contracted social body grasp for absolute security behind heavily guarded barricades.Separation, isolation, disintegration, and death is the process of empire that is suffered by the homeless, the executive of transnational corporations, social bodies of empire culture and the ecosystem alike.Eight thousand years ago we began to see death of ecosystems from over-grazing and agriculture in Central Asia, the Indus Valley and China. Five thousand years ago we began to see the death of the conquered, the slaves and the land, as the empires grew. Two thousand years ago, death was accelerating with the Mediterranean empires. Five hundred years ago death was spreading planet-wide. Now all of the corners of the world are filled up. The finale of disintegration is upon us.The swelling mass that eats up its own sustenance has now reached the end. There is no more, but the mass continues to swell. It is not likely that the habits of empire, set subconsciously in the minds of billions, can be reformed in the decade or two decades that would be necessary to save the situation. Barring transcendental transformation of the whole culture of empire, we will see the trends of ten thousand years of imperial history culminate in our lifetime.The power of the empire is the power to destroy. Our role is not to fight for the power of destruction but to unify with the creative power of the cosmos. Our role is not to isolate, extort and destroy but to love, live and create.We are not fighting to reform a maladaptive and dying social body. There is no conflict with civilization, it is passing away. There is no battle for civilization's power, the power to kill. There is only the open, positive and sharing sustenance of the new life. The emergence of the new growth is our focus of attention. The emergence of our new babies, the emergence of our new culture and the emergence of the new earth is the focus. We have the standards of existence on this planet before us. They are simple and fundamental. We are simply righting the inversion.As with a physical wound, the imperial tissue that has lost integration with the body, lost coherence with the complex flows of energy, falls away. One allows the diseased and injured portions to fall away, while resisting injury to that which is still healthy. One focuses on the new growth, the area of healing. We attempt to protect the best that remains and focus on the new biological growth for the future. One focuses on the smiling faces of that seventh generation of the future that will be created.A crisis, according to Webster, is, "A stage in a sequence of events at which the trend of all future events is determined, a turning point." In the case of civilization, it is now poised, tipping and beginning the slide into complete disintegration. We are at the cusp of the last cycle. Since World War II we have seen the acceleration of the disintegration. Human population and the consumption of the earth's life -- "resources" have grown exponentially. Now the seepage of poisons is so great that everyone on earth is endangered. The seeping of poison is symbolic of the movement of the whole of industrial society. The popular parable of our situation is the boiling of the frog. If the frog is thrown in boiling water it will hop out. If the frog is put in cold water and the water is heated slowly the frog will not be able to recognize the rising of the heat. That is our situation. We do not consciously perceive the increments of dissolution. We now are at the pivot point where we still have the ability to maneuver. We are not yet in a state of social collapse with most of our valid options closed off.Our future is not a political problem or a technical problem; it is a cultural problem. We live in a diseased culture. It is our way of life that is destroying the earth. Look at the big, dead and poisoned spot on the planet that is called a city. Simply the poisons that run off of it in rainstorms are killing life for miles around. Civilization is now so poisonous that if a city were blown up in a war the most severe danger would be from the spread of chemicals from factories as well as the nuclear power plants rather than simply from the bomb itself.Humans easily could deal with the problem. Humans, individually have the innate abilities. If all humans on the planet could center their attention on the whole picture at the same moment, see the problem and then take action, the solution could be at hand. They would then reduce the birth rate to one child per woman and begin to live in balance and to restore the life of the earth. As the birth rate radically declined the "wealth" would increase proportionately.Rather than wait for this to occur, we need take action now. We must overcome our paralysis of fear and confusion and take control of our lives. We must cease investing our emotional energy and condition in the events of civilization. It is diseased to the core. We must realize the "dear thing" cannot be saved, even with major surgery. Anytime change is presented to us we suffer a wave of reaction, a "security crisis." We begin to grasp for rationales. We begin to find reasons why we cannot change. "If we prepare to survive, 'they' will just come get what we have," is a customary response, which rests on some unexamined assumption that presents future masses of hungry refugees wandering about while "survivalists" sit on a pile of goodies. The image of the "survivalist" is the final extrapolation of the social isolate. The reality is, that if we cannot reach out to community, to cooperative self-organization, we cannot survive. It is the movement toward a positive and adaptive new culture that is needed.The path leads back to the source. The standard to guide us is the "solar budget." We must allow the planet's life its net photosynthetic production, aid it, and live from the increase. The full-blown climax ecosystem is the standard of health for our earth. This means drastic reduction of human population density. We must return to what our human family has known for two million years, a life that produces life and encourages full participation by every member. This reality is our basic grounding. Our task is to create the healing of self, community and planet. There is no other way.
2nc74v	-30782	1416889209	collapse	Accept the collapse and focus on dealing with the effects while we still can	What makes the current collapse different from any previous collapse is that we're now living in an industrialized society. The cities export death to the surrounding countryside. We live in cities where the chemicals escaping from our factories and nuclear power plants would kill more people than the bomb that destroyed the city.We know about Chernobyl and Fukushima and the ongoing catastrophes of these disasters, but look at a non-nuclear case like Bhopal, where some pesticide precursor chemicals escaped. According to the Indian government, the Bhopal disaster has caused over half a million injuries alone. The soil is still contaminated with all these chemicals, people will be exposed for generations to come.Look at a case like the Gulf oil spill, where the animals die and the fish can't be eaten. The oilcano only stopped spewing after they capped the well, but who can guarantee this can be done in a collapse scenario? Even now the dolphins are still dying from the effects of the toxins they sprayed to hide the oil.In 2000, the leak of cyanide eradicated practically all life in rivers in Hungary and Yugoslavia. Centralia in Pennsylvania had to be evacuated, because of a coal mine fire that has been ongoing since 1962. In Australia, Wittenoom is uninhabitable, because they used to mine asbestos there. In China 20% of all arable land is already contaminated with chemical pollutants.If we're going to be dealing with a massive economic downturn in the near future, we won't have the resources to prevent disasters from occurring. We have to respond preemptively to this situation, by voluntary deindustrializing our economies. Instead of trusting on hypothetical contingency plans that depend on the overall functioning of society, we have to look at the facilities that have the most potential to do harm to our environment and preemptively dismantle them.We won't have the resources to extinguish a coal fire, cap a leaking deepwater oil well, prevent radioactive water from spilling into the ocean, clean up soil contaminated with chemical pollutants. If we move away from trying to prevent collapse through technological solutions and further growth, to acknowledging collapse and preparing for it by dismantling our most dangerous industrial facilities, a lot of disastrous effects can be prevented.

2nj9hr	-30782	1417051071	accountt1234	America does not really exist	I came to the conclusion today that America does not really exist. It may be a media hoax that got out of hand, invented as a film set for dystopian movies about capitalism gone rogue. Perhaps it's promoted by the government, to make people less cynical about their own lot in life. It might have been invented by the English, to promote their language as the new Lingua Franca, instead of French. It might have been invented as a metaphor for neoliberalism, invented by people on the far right or far left. It might even be a collective hallucination, or a product of our subconscious fears.There is no strong persuasive evidence that America really exists. It has seemingly no history prior to 1492, when some guy named Columbus supposedly discovered it. Through some sort of disease, everyone who lived there then suddenly dropped dead. It's very convenient, as it means you can make up anything you want about the past. I was taught in college that "Native Americans had no alphabet because they communicated using knots in ropes." Who really believes this? People who claim to be Native Americans all look suspiciously similar to white people. These original inhabitants seem to have left no impact on their environment either. White people had to build most of the cities, much of the continent consists of forests, South America still does. We probably have three bucks left in our country, but in America, they have to shoot their deer because they simply have too many of them. When the first white people arrived, they could simply shoot up in the air to eat some passenger pigeons.The people who supposedly migrated to America don't seem to be alive. It seems they died. We're supposed to believe that millions of Irish people went to America during the Irish potato famine. It sounds a lot like the British covering up their crimes. "No, those people are not dead, they left, they went to America you see!" Or how about all the Puritans and other British religious wackos? Supposedly they went to North America and became a new nation's upper class, rather than being thrown into the dungeons and never heard from again. While the rest of Europe slaughtered ethnic and religious minorities, the English supposedly handed them an entire continent for free. American politicians are never really seen in the media, unless they have to fight a war or have some embarrassing problem, like lack of affordable health care or rioting. I suspect they're hired actors, used to read a script. European countries that want to invade third world countries claim they're simply helping "America", a country that doesn't exist. If you look at the biography of these politicians the Americans have, you find out that they're simply actors. Ronald Reagan was originally some sort of cowboy actor. Arnold Schwarzenegger went from being an actor and a bodybuilder from Austria to running the government of California. This guy Barack Obama simply doesn't even seem to exist. He showed up out of seemingly nowhere. Do we even have any video footage of him before he began to run for president? Even his own former classmates [don't remember him](http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/obama-s-israeli-columbia-classmates-don-t-recall-the-young-president.premium-1.509648). American presidents don't live normal lives, their lives look as if they live in bad soap series. Ronald Reagan got shot and survived. Kennedy got shot. Clinton got thrown out because he cheated on his wife. And where did Sarah Palin come from? That woman was almost Vice-President, but she looks like a minor character used simply because the sexual tension was missing.Americans claim to have all sorts of stuff that sounds completely unrealistic. They supposedly won an independence war against the British, but they will readily admit there was hardly any real fighting. They supposedly bought most of mainland America from Napoleon in the Louisiana purchase. Here we have an insane dictator who wants to conquer Europe, but decides to give away his land to some exiled religious fundamentalists? In today's dollars, they bought much of the country for 42 cents per acre. They even claim to have bought Alaska from the Russians. I don't know if you've ever heard about how many wars we've fought with the Russians over land here in Europe, but if you had, you wouldn't buy the story that the Russians simply decided to sell a plot of land the size of all of Western Europe.America is supposed to have been settled by French people, Germans, Scottish people, Dutch people, Italians, Scandinavians, Irish and others, but all these people have no issue at all speaking English all day long, they supposedly don't even remember their native languages. Moroccan immigrants here still have Moroccan flags hanging from their balcony and the elderly don't speak Dutch, but the French and the Germans supposedly have no issue at all with speaking English everyday. I recommend everyone to try talking to a French guy here in English, see how it goes. Make sure to keep your distance though, so you've got at least somewhat of a chance to dodge his punches.Perhaps the most ridiculous story of the Americans is that they claim to have a giant city in the middle of the desert called Las Vegas. The only purpose this city actually serves is as a place for people to gamble. Obviously this makes no sense. Nobody who is rich enough to travel to the middle of a desert is going to be desperate enough to spend his days gambling. We have casinos in my country, they're owned by the government, they're fun for a night, but that's it. How can you have an entire city dedicated to gambling? This story is as ridiculous as the myth of Atlantis.What did the Americans ever do for us? Supposedly they liberated us in World War II, together with the Canadians and the English. Here you have a bunch of English speaking people march through a starving traumatized population, wearing similar uniforms and using similar weaponry but telling us that they're really all from three different independent nations. Sounds like a case of intimidating your enemy by making your force appear larger than it really is, a myth to fool the Germans, just like the carrots that help their pilots see better at night. What really happened here was obviously that the Russians pushed back the Germans and the English decided to quickly land as well after the Russians had won the war.What do you ever see of America? You hardly see anything other than New York City, where the most important landmarks, Wall Street, the World Trade Center and the Statue of Liberty are. Now that the WTC is gone, the new scenery they like to use to lure you to New York are the coffee shops and other hipster spots where Lena Dunham hangs out. If you're successful enough to get invited to work there or visit as a tourist, you end up in New York city. Surprise surprise, Manhattan happens to be on an island. Here we supposedly have this giant continent, but for some reason everyone decides to live on an island with the very original name "Long island" and all business happens there too. This is basically as if some guy claims to own an office building, but he invites you to the door step and won't let you in any further. I don't know anyone who really managed to stay in New York City, all I know are people who visited for internships that never led to real jobs and tourists. I suspect the skyscrapers are made out of cardboard and empty inside.What does the American economy consists of? Nobody really knows. Supposedly they're the largest economy in the world, but I can't remember the last time I bought something that said "made in America" rather than "made in China". They seem to spend their days waiting each others tables and selling their homes back and forth to one another. Americans also earn money producing movies and music, but this doesn't mean anything. Hollywood could simply be the name of a film set somewhere in England and we wouldn't be any the wiser. What about all these massive American corporations then, like Google and Starbucks? They're not even located in "America". They're located in Ireland, the Netherlands and other European countries, supposedly because of our low tax rates. This is like someone claiming to own a Lamborghini, but his garage is empty, so he claims he stores the car in *your* garage, because it saves him money.How about American culture then? For fun you should check it out, you'll find out most of what we think is American is really produced by marketing companies. My suspicion is that marketing companies use the "America" meme to pretend something they came up with is cool and we Europeans should try it out too. Let's take some examples, shall we? Rudolf the Rednose Reindeer? [Invented by a retail department.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer) Bacon and Eggs? [Invented by Edward Bernays.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer) How about surprising your girlfriend with an engagement ring? [Invented by De Beers, because they discovered that men buy more expensive rings than women would pick.](http://oldweb.fgc.edu/media/67303/sheri%20carder%20diamonds%20article.pdf) Everything they told you is a lie. America is the name of a movie studio.
2nllr7	-30782	1417114642	thenetherlands	Mijn achternaam brengt mij een hoop ellende. Wat moet ik doen?	Hallo,Mijn naam is Danny en ik ben 21 jaar oud. Mijn achternaam is Tokkie. Dat klinkt misschien als een grap, maar het is echt zo en voor mij is het al lang niet grappig meer. Er zijn ongeveer 150 mensen in Nederland die onze achternaam delen, en de problemen van één gezin waar alleen de moeder de naam draagt leveren mij en waarschijnlijk ook andere Tokkies erg veel problemen op.Ik heb de hotelschool afgerond, maar de ellende bij het zoeken van een baan is enorm. Ik snap dat dit momenteel voor alle jongeren het geval is, maar mijn achternaam zorgt ervoor dat ik als grap behandeld wordt of uit angst voor het stigma gewoon genegeerd. Als ik uit ga met vrienden en me ID moet laten zien word ik soms spontaan geweigerd. "Je ID ziet er nep uit" Krijg ik dan te horen. In de trein brak een conducteur enkele jaren terug spontaan in lachen uit en vroeg "Je ouders heten zeker Henk en Ingrid?".Nu kan ik mijn achternaam wel laten veranderen, maar ik kijk daar erg tegen op. Mijn grootvader is een broer verloren in de oorlog vanwege onze Joodse achtergrond. De naam Tokkie is van Sephardische afkomst, vermoedelijk een verbastering van "Tucci". We zijn ondertussen net als de meeste Nederlanders geseculariseerd, maar het veranderen van mijn achternaam zou erg pijnlijk zijn gezien onze familie geschiedenis.Ondertussen is het normaal geworden bij mensen die zichzelf vaak als heel progressief zien om het woord "Tokkie" te gebruiken voor autochtonen waar ze op neer kijken. PVV-stemmers zijn PVV Tokkies, een grote bulldog is een Tokkie hond, een achterstandswijk een Tokkie wijk, enzovoort. Mensen doen dit ongetwijfeld niet bewust, maar het veroorzaakt ons een hoop ellende. Ik weet niet of iemand echt een oplossing weet, maar het lucht al erg op om dit gewoon met anderen te kunnen delen.

The correct answer would be Donald Trump. By encouraging trade tarrifs on products from China, Donald Trump would do more to stop the destruction of our natural world than Greenpeace ever will. The problem we face is the economy itself. It's a monstrous machine that seeks to perpetually continue growing and subject every aspect of the natural world to its own internal order.Greenpeace is a disease. It is your enemy infiltrating your own ranks. Anyone who genuinely cares about our world instead of appearing like part of the good guys by repeating leftist dogmas has abandoned the organization, including Paul Watson, a genuine ecowarrior who bailed ship after founding the organization and seeing that the organization had been castrated. Even today, the gaping wound is treated with ointments composed of neolibalism, political correctness and a naive faith in technological shortcuts that will allow us to avoid tough choices altogether.Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd Society has exposed multiple times that Greenpeace refuses to address any actual real problems. There's no mention of animal husbandry and its destructive impact on our remaining natural beauty whatsoever.1 In addition, the Greenpeace leadership pretends that overpopulation will solve itself. If you have a steady stream of donations, why risk alienating people by telling them that we can't have our cake and eat it too? Greenpeace is run by people with the mentality of white collar management types. They care about their status and growing their own organization. If they were not working for Greenpeace, they'd work in some other NGO or some government department, because like all liberals they like to be part of the world's big movers and shakers.Paul Watson is the real deal. He has spent months in jail because of his actions and risks his life to save the remaining wilderness of our world. He wants to reduce the world's population to less than one billion and get rid of cars, airplanes and all other destructive technology. There are others who are really genuinely concerned with saving the world's remaining wilderness from being consumed by human civilization and like happened to Watson, all Greenpeace does is attempt to obstruct their success.In Switzerland, ecologists have succeeded in forcing a public vote on their proposal to limit immigration to a maximum of 0.2% of the population and force a minimum of 10% of the federal foreign aid budget to be spent on family planning services. How does Greenpeace Switzerland respond to this proposal? They're against it.3 Greenpeace Switzerland claims that the solution lies in sharing and educating women and girls, as if this will magically convince people to stop having children. When education reduces birth rates, it is because it exports the same liberal values and cultural orientation that is prevalent in Europe and the US today. Instead of having kids, the women have to be "liberated", which means spending the first 25 years in school until they have a master's degree, after which they can find some sort of job in a call center or as an HR worker, with such strong social pressures throughout their day to day existence that they would never even dream of having children. How do you create such a society, where women and children in general can be educated? You'll have to create a social infrastructure that enables the families to avoid having their children participate in day to day economic life. In many cultures families collectively plow the fields and the help of children is essential to the community they belong to. Some African cultures refuse agricultural modernization, simply because it means they can no longer cooperate in food production. The solution that Greenpeace proposes in other words, is synonymous with economic development and the spread of Western neoliberal culture. Greenpeace effectively demands that agriculture in the third world is modernized, to ensure that the underlying economic developments can occur that enable children and women to spend their first twenty years or more in school and create jobs for them, for which they will need the education. In other words, Greenpeace declares that the solution to ecological destruction is for the third world to take over the lifestyle of the first world.At the same time, the Greenpeace piece proclaims that environmental destruction is caused by the West and those who should really be handed contraceptives are rich people. They're wrong of course. The regions with the highest tropical deforestation rate between 2000 and 2005 were Central America and tropical Asia. Places that are losing their rainforests are those that are undergoing the disease of economic development that Greenpeace hopes to export to the third world. Incorporating land use changes, Papua New Guinea had a higher level of CO2 emissions per capita in 2000 than the United States. Why is that? Because the country is being economically developed.Nothing is sustainable about our developed lifestyle, the cancer that Greenpeace seeks to export to the third world. Tim Jackson looked in 2009 at what would need to happen for the whole world to take over the Western lifestyle. If we want to have the whole world live a lifestyle of Europeans in 2007, CO2 emissions per dollar of GDP would have to be reduced to 14 gram, from our current level of 768.4 This would have to happen before 2050, to keep CO2 levels in the atmosphere below 450 parts per million. In other words, when Verena Mühlberger, leader of Greenpeace Switzerland, declares that the solution lies in the sharing of our wealth with the rest of the world, she's proclaiming that she has a miracle solution. Perhaps she is going to teach us how to produce meat for Africans ex nihilo. Maybe she has stolen a car that runs on water from an oil company's safe and heats her house with a cold fusion nuclear reactor she built in her basement.Alternatively, perhaps Mrs Mühlberger is simply talking out of her ass. Perhaps she's mostly interested in promoting the politically correct social justice agenda that has reigned supreme over Western society since the end of world war two. There exist no zero sum games in the world of people like Mrs Mühlberger, technology and the ideology of human(!) egalitarianism combine to ensure that we will always be able to have our cake yet eat it too, without ever having to face any real tough choices. We can eat what we want, pop out as many children as we want, drive a car and use a computer and a yakuzi, without ever having to hear the word "no".-------------1 - http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:y-UhSVnFKoMJ:www.seashepherd.org/commentary-and-editorials/2014/05/06/v-648+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=nl&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=nl2 - http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/06/leftist_bigshots_openly_proclaim_they_wont_live_by_the_rules_they_want_others_to_follow.html3 - https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=nl&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenpeace.org%2Fswitzerland%2Fde%2FNews_Stories%2FNewsblog%2Fpk-ecopop%2Fblog%2F50373%2F&amp;edit-text=4 - http://steadystate.org/wp-content/uploads/Jackson_2009_Beyond_the_Growth_Economy.pdf

Who could have imagined that?The problem comes with trying to interpret all of that. Perhaps humans in industrial civilization prefer extremely masculine and feminine faces, because we're generally rather sexually ambigious. Our women suffer elevated testosterone from polycystic ovary syndrome, our men are exposed to estrogenic chemicals in plastics. Look at old pictures of people and you'll notice the boys generally looked like men at an earlier age. Studies from multiple countries show that men used to have heavier testicles fifty years ago than they do now:http://link.springer.com/article/10.1046%2Fj.0022-7722.2002.00009.x#page-1Why is that? Very hard to say. Some blame estrogenic pollutants in our environment, but I think there could be a variety of potential reasons, extending to poor diet in general. An alternative explanation we could consider is that people today are simply under severe stress and display behavior that is associated with that, just like wolves in captivity behave differently. Thus we want more masculine men.At the same time, women's role within society has been gradually reduced since the Neolithic revolution. During the industrial revolution, the ideal became for women to sit at home and not really do much of anything at all. We can look at digit ratios of people in the past and notice that both the men and the women had more masculine digit ratios:http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101103081915.htmThis would be expected to have made the men as well as the women more promiscuous, because testosterone makes both men and women more interested in sex. Thus, we can imagine what would happen over human history. Agriculture emerges, men impose monoandry on women. Sex before or outside of marriage carries the death penalty. The women who comply with that would have less interest in sex to begin with. Elite men pick out the most feminine looking women in society. Gradually humans, both men and women, become more feminine. Traits that are now only seen in men, like a brow ridge, used to be seen in exaggerated form in our ancestors, both male and female. Neanderthal women were stronger than most men are today.Studies find that feminist women today have more masculine digit ratios:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25250010Thus it could be that the idea of hunter-gatherers being gender-egalitarian is true, but that it happened because the women were generally more masculine in personality and physique than women are today. Which would probably offend both feminists and anti-feminists.

2p54bm	-30782	1418440733	collapse	The end of agriculture	I'm predicting that agriculture will gradually disappear in the 21st century. The Neolithic revolution took place more or less simultaneously in multiple areas of the globe, during the beginning of the Holocene. Our ability to practice agriculture appears to depend on our unique climatic conditions.Agriculture is practiced by non-human animals, most notably [ants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant%E2%80%93fungus_mutualism). This however, is an argument against our ability to continue practicing agriculture, rather than for it. If ants can evolve to practice agriculture underground, why are there no species practicing agriculture above ground, other than us, who have only done this for about six thousand years now? Eusociality can evolve in mammals too, as the, naked mole rats show, so that can't be the problem.The reason we won't be able to sustain agriculture is because it was temporarily made possibly by unusually low atmospheric CO2 concentrations and the relatively stable climate that accompanied it. When atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise, our plants won't be able to compete with fungal pathogens, insects and other plants. We're not yet noticing effects of the problem, because we now have pesticides. When we lose those pesticides, the fungal pathogen, insect and weed populations will grow, even disrupting the success of farmers that don't use pesticides themselves, but benefit indirectly from their application. [Evidence for this assertion is found in the fact that the 1980's saw 13 percent of crops lost to pests, compared to seven percent in the 1940's, despite people using more pesticides in the 1940's.](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/10/1/l_101_02.html) Crops have become dependent on pesticides to survive. The changing conditions probably even helped spur the development of industrial agriculture in a positive feedback loop, simply because applying pesticides became necessary.The expectation that we'll somehow end up colonizing space is silly, because we've seen no evidence whatsoever that any other species has succeeded at it, hence Fermi's paradox. My expectation is that we will ultimately end up returning to life as nomadic hunter-gatherers. We've done that for 99% of our existence, so it's a relatively safe bet. It's also a good thing. Hunter-gatherers don't practice slavery, don't have a caste system, don't mutilate their children's genitals, don't mass-produce deformed animals stick them in cages and feed them antibiotics, don't stick their parents in nursery homes, don't teach their children that parental love depends on their ability to memorize arbitrary factoids, and don't live in concrete cubes stacked on top of each other.

I no longer think it's useful to imagine some sort of dichotomy existing between Celts and Germans. The problem is that I had bought into a misrepresentation of our Germanic heritage. Germanic heritage has multiple aspects to it, but some aspects receive a disproportionate amount of attention. What I interpreted as the old religion may be better referred to as "ponytailism". Ponytailism is Germanic heathenism, but of a type that emphasizes all the aspects that appeal to angry teenage boys and fit into a metal song: Beer, mead, animal sacrifice, human sacrifice, plunder and war. I am not opposed to those aspects of religion, but I do not believe that it is constructive to place the emphasis on these aspects. These aspects of Germanic heathenism became more important when Germanic heathenism became threatened with extinction due to the spread of Christianity, which also happens to be when Christians began writing down their surviving traditions.Some Africans, Papuans and Indians are lucky enough to be born into a culture where their ancestral religion is more or less intact. The first genuine expression of a living heathenism that I encountered as a child was African, from an African man who visited our school to tell a lively and animated tale about an African trickster spirit, the spider Anansi. Anansi has survived the transatlantic slave trade and ended up in the Dutch colonies, from where he eventually ended up in our school.Anansi was lucky. The heathen tales of Europe had to withstand a test of time much longer than the legends of West Africa. Furthermore, unlike the Germans and the other converted peoples of Europe, the African never stood a chance of being assimilated and passing as yet another Christian. If you are forever chained to the bottom of the social pyramid, you have little incentive to take over the traditions of your master. Preserving your heritage becomes a way of spiting your master. The Africans are not alone in this, the Saxon peasants, who had lost much of their freedom after their conquest by Charlemagne, clinged on to paganism for as long as they could as well, even despite Charlemagne imposing the death penalty on those who refused to convert to Christianity. Most of us Northern Europeans arrive at heathenism not through birth, but through a deep sense of grief. There is an emptiness in our hearts, where a rich cultural and metaphysical tradition is supposed to live. We are born to atheist parents who take irreligiousness for granted, as they are often themselves the children of lapsed Christians. As Moldbug would say, they have replaced Christianity 1.0 with Christianity 2.0. This metaphor becomes more relevant as the days go by. Newer versions of the software we use are almost universally forced down our throat, delivering us nothing except for new clausules too long for us to read that serve to further infringe upon our privacy. Christianity 2.0, generally referred to as Atheism, is a deterioration of Christianity 1.0, which itself is a deterioration of the early Christianity practiced by Roman slaves as a form of rebellion against the cult of Emperor worshippers. It appealed to them because it inverted the power dynamics that existed there. The emperor is rich and strong, the Nazarene is weak and nailed to a cross. Christianity was eventually legalized by an emperor as part of a strategic decision, with local power dynamics in the back of his mind, from which point onwards it began to evolve into what we know today. Christianity thrived in Europe by becoming a chimera, fulfilling deep seated spiritual needs that were normally taken care of by the Heathen religions. Christianity developed a pantheon of its own, of saints who do not interact with each other, but occupy niches that other Gods would normally fulfill. Surveys show that in 1960's France, just 5% of working class people had visited mass in the previous year, while 49% of men and 78% of women had visited the shrine of a saint.1 In some cases, pagan Gods appear to have been transformed into saints. The Irish Saint Brigid is celebrated on 1 February, just as the Goddess Brigid was celebrated during Imbolc, on the same date. Atheists also have their own pantheon, of scientists whose knowledge governs every aspect of material reality. Note how the most prestigious scientists are astrophysicists, cosmologists and astronomers, whose realm exists somewhere above. Supreme deities are Carl Sagan, Neil degrasse Tyson and Stephen Hawking, to name but a few. They fulfill the same function, to take away uncertainty. They don't just have answers to mathematical equations, but understand how to live a meaningful life and fill the void in your heart. It generally involves going to college and studying some technical subject matter. An ancestor could once become a pagan God, a good Catholic can become a saint, a good atheist may very well one day find his face adorning pictures of space on Facebook.Both religions, Atheism and Christianity, don't appeal to me. They share their biggest vices. Both Atheism and Christianity teach a kind of weakness. Atheism teaches a kind of morality that comes down to secularized Christianity. Be kind, be generous, obey the law, don't put your own kin above the families of others and avoid violent retribution at all cost. This is the type of value orientation that keeps the poor and powerless poor and powerless. The rich and powerful pay lip service to this type of morality. When a medieval man was knighted, he used to be slapped in the face, as this slap in the face was the last he could accept without enforcing retribution. This is of course hard to reconcile with the turn the other cheek mentality taught to us by the man from Nazaret.Christianity is a slave religion. It served to sedate slaves, to make their suffering and humiliation a bit more bearable. Those who convert to this religion are the same as ever, the hopeless attracted to its celebration of weakness and poverty. Prominent people who convert to Christianity are opportunists. Scandinavian royalty converted because of trade interests, the Saxon upper class converted because it allowed them to further restrict the rights of the lower Saxon castes. Ultimately, the better response to slavery is to cast your master off your back, rather than to adhere to a metaphysical belief system that places you on top and your master at the bottom, even if only in the afterlife. Your servile status implies a chronic death. Genetically you are dying over generations, psychologically you are dying every day. The acute death of resistance is preferable, but those who have chosen resistance are not with us today to tell their story. Charlemagne once slaughtered 4,500 pagan Saxons in just one single massacre. Many surviving Saxons were dispersed, to encourage their assimilation.Christianity is a Roman religion. It is intimately tied to imperialism. The spread of Christianity has meant the spread of Roman culture. The Franks were latinized and became French, a language mutually intelligible with Italian. Even in the 20th century, priests wrote the taboo parts of their book in Latin, to avoid having commoners understand what they were talking about. Christianity inevitably teaches you to think like a Roman subject. Its morality and impoverished theology that places salvation at the center is meant for the peasantry, its culture is meant for the upper class. Hence we find the servile classes converting to Evangelical churches whose scriptural language is English, while the upper classes are attracted to Catholicism with its elaborate rituals and Anglicanism, a church for a Norman upper class that has always considered itself separate from mainland Europe. Ever notice how "high church" is used to refer to more Catholic forms of the Church of England?What unites Atheism and Christianity is the hatred of pleasure. Pleasure is never to be indulged in, but always to be deferred, to some time in the future or some point after death. Atheism has been more successful at this than Christianity, when we consider how occupied young people are with their education, as opposed to their grandparents before them. Compare how much time you spend reading your college textbooks to the amount of time your grandparents spent reading their Bible and I'm sure you will be shocked, especially if your grandparents are Catholic.The heathen religions, in contrast, are hedonic religions. They celebrate the here and now, the living breathing creation that surrounds us. The English Free and the German Frei come from the same root as the name Freyja. In Dutch, we use "vrijen" to refer to making love, with emphasis lying on love over sex. For the Saxons, freedom became intimately tied to the state of paganism they remember from before the imposition of Christianity. Freyja is an erotic and passionate Goddess, replaced by the paradox Mary, the virgin who gave birth. Missionaries decried Her as a harlot, plants named after Freyja were renamed after Mary, as a Romanized elite sought to eradicate the organic culture of the peasantry.I don't like the Roman empire. I never have. I hated having to learn Latin in school. Nothing about the language is intuitive, it's a puzzle, a system with an artificial order that only a programmer could appreciate. The language only serves to unify a caste that governs Western civilization. There's nothing praiseworthy about the Roman empire. It eradicated entire cultures. Many of its contemporary writers hated it and when it began to collapse, Germanic invaders were welcomed by its underclasses. The Roman empire however never really died. It split into two parts, the Western empire was eventually replaced by the Holy Roman Empire and today the new incarnation is referred to as the European Union. Even the United States were modelled off the Roman empire in its glory days.What characterizes the Roman empire is that power is gained through loyalty to its culture. Whatever benefits Rome will benefit you. With the new Roman religion being atheism/secular humanism, taught in universities throughout the world that preserve Roman heritage, promoting faith in the scientific method and our ability to improve upon the spontaneous order of nature gains you prestige. When a man like Bill Nye criticizes GMO crops, he loses the prestige within the Roman community that he earned by encouraging children to become STEM-nerds. Rome doesn't need principled individuals loyal to their internal moral compass, it needs people who can grant it power.With the new pope, Christianity 1.0 and Christianity 2.0 are now open to ecumenism. Just as Microsoft continually delays ending support for Windows XP, Christianity 1.0 will receive extended tolerance as a transitory form of the Roman religion, still useful for imposing Roman culture on the third world masses and once more sedating the poor in an era of unprecedented wealth inequality. In exchange for being tolerated by the new elite, Christianity 1.0 had to abandon its disgust with homosexuals that was rendered obsolete in Christianity 2.0, even though it can not abolish the doctrine itself, as it was hardcoded by an old team of programmers.I'm sure I'm not alone when I state that I am happy to see that Rome's days are numbered. There are many of us out there who would like to see Rome burn. Because Rome is sick, it can only expand and leave behind wastelands. Bonifacius converted the Germans to Christianity by chopping down a sacred ancient Oak tree. Everyone knows the tree can be chopped down, that's not what makes it sacred. What makes it sacred is that nothing better can replace it. Bonifacius illustrated this himself, when he chopped down a sacred tree to build a church. What does this tell you about Rome? Are you thankful for the cubicles, colleges and churches it built to replace the trees? Chopping down the trees of Europe is what plunged this continent into the little ice age.2 This century is the century in which the Roman empire dies. The gaping holes discovered in the Siberian permafrost are a harbinger of Rome's own future. Perhaps it will finally figure out why we venerate trees.--------------------------------###References1 - http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0015587X.2011.6082622 - http://lib.gen.in/next/MTAuMTAyOS8yMDAwZ2wwMDYxMjE=/govindasamy2001.pdf

We're talking about getting the **cheapest seats** @ ~~$35 + whatever fees~~ about $45 after fees on IRC so thought we could gauge interest here.  Tickets go on sale 3/31 so we have time to set up a group buy for the **best** cheap seats :x    Update 1 (3/20@1400PST): Pre-Sales start this coming Monday 3/24 @ 10AM; 4 tickets maximum per little monster early access code  **Update 2** (3/23@1630PST): There's presales for parking as well.  [Prices ranges from](https://tickets.axs.com/eventShopperV3.html?wr=fa7f6c88-1025-4dfb-a96b-ca92871b1de0&amp;skin=staplespark&amp;preFill=1) $18-25 + fees based on the pricing from the 7/21 show.  You can order one for yourself [here](http://www.axs.com/events/246722/lady-gaga-tickets/promos/13460) or let me know which lot you want to park in and I'll include it in the ticket order.    **Update 3** (3/24 @ 1030PST): So Pre-sale tickets are live.  The P4 $35.00 + fees seats are not available so I'll be getting the next one up which is $49.50 + fees = $62.xx.  Ticket sales are done automatically as "best seats available" so some crappy sections are being filled first.  Holding out for seats with a better angle.  Also, the likelihood of getting 7 consecutive seats is probably a non-starter.  Most likely we'll be in the same section but not together (3+4).  **Update 4** (3/24 @ 1230PST): ~~I give up.  Presales seem to be very limited for the "cheaper" seats.  I'm going to try again tomorrow through the citibank early access and hope they open up better sections.~~  **Update 5** (3/24 @ 1330PST): So apparently the site updated and you can choose sections now.  Not sure when it changed but **I ended up getting Section 301, Row 3, Seats 6-12.  Total price was $62.50 as they're the 2nd to the lowest priced seats.**  You guys can ping me on IRC to get info on sending payment by paypal or chase quickpay.  **Group buy Participants:**  aknite  CKtalon    kevph  YongChicken  momoyome  Jude  FreddyBlackJack  ~~hg4wee~~  ~~peachee~~

Been busy with work and school so I'll make this brief.  Reference Links: [Phase 1 Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/crayonpop/comments/22z7ku/uhee_cd_giveaway_phase_1_crayon_pop_cover/)  ||  [Phase 2 Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/crayonpop/comments/24frjd/uhee_cd_giveaway_phase_2_crayon_pop_cover/)  **Cover/Art Contest Winners** -------------------  **Signed Uh-Ee Albums**  /u/JRAGuam  /u/imjude28  /u/Sebrene  .  **Unsigned Uh-Ee Albums**  /u/025geru *  /u/asm1th  /u/chibihara  /u/Trn4mr  .

Updates on Covers/Art being shown/given to Crayon Pop---------------------------  Things didn't go accordingly to plan due to time constraints and issues that came up at KMF.

As to how it gets to them, we are looking at a few options and will update you in the near future.  .  .  **T-Shirts** ----------------  I have contacted everyone that ordered shipped **in the US** by private message/email and should have everything shipped out by Wed/Thurs to those that paid. If you didn't see a PM, send me one and I'll give you payment info. Had an issue with supplies coming in later than expected so couldn't get them out this weekend.  I'll be messaging those getting them shipped internationally later this week as I calculate shipping for each individual.  ----------**Extra Albums**  I'll have extra albums from Mwave so **send me a private message** if you want to reserve either signed or unsigned albums. I won't be responding to any inquiries not made by private message.-------------------------------  That's all folks.  Congrats to all the winners!

We'll be joining [@CrayonPopMexico](https://twitter.com/CrayonPopMexico) and Japan's Crayon Pop fansite, [Heart Pop](https://twitter.com/crayonpop_info), in their twitter campaigns to wish Soyul a happy birthday. However, we're going to add our own /r/crayonpop / [Crayonpop.US](https://www.facebook.com/Crayonpop.us) twist.  .  So what's different? Well, in the recent Beatles Code episode, Soyul mentioned that during her ulzzang days, fanboys would post banners all over school for her birthday [like so [Link]](http://i.imgur.com/k0vLdMo.gif).  We want to help her relive that experience so here's what we're doing!  .  **How to participate**  1) Pick your favorite Soyul pic [[some Pics Here]](http://www.reddit.com/r/crayonpop/comments/23qtw3/this_weeks_side_bar_ellin_doesnt_want_her_month/)  2) Add a birthday message to it in English or Korean [[some messages in Hangul]](http://pastebin.com/h8zvMfgd)  3) Tweet  "[Short message]  [Image link]   @crayonpop   #HappyBirthdaytoSoyul!   #HappySoyulDay"  Edit the spacing if you're copying and pasting, reddit uses double space as a line break4) Start tweeting once the clock strikes midnight in Korea! Here's a sample of a banner that /u/junxz came up with [[Link]](http://i.imgur.com/BhblGYah.jpg)  Feel free to share your creations below to help others come up with new ideas!

Please read carefully before purchasing **What is the mosaic?**  Every copy you purchase will give you 1 (one) entry onto the mosaic. During the live stream, the group will randomly pick X out of the 49 to also receive a special badge/pin. If you are picked, you will receive a large button with  and MWAVE on it, which will be shipped with your signed album  **What is happy hour?**  During the live stream, towards the end, the group will randomly pick a few more members from the mosaics to receive a signed poster.  **What are the top supporters?**  The more you purchase of the album from MWAVE, the more you are "entered" into the top supports. Whoever purchases the most albums will be number 1, and followed by 2-5. The prizes are as follows:  **Top 5 Supporters normally get:**    Top 1: A Polaroid Photos of ALL members [sometimes + Special Present]  Top 2~5: Polaroid Photos of one member  **Refer to specific Meet &amp; Greet pages for exact prizes.****How does shipping work?**    This will depend on your country. However, please be aware that shipping times are very, very long depending on the artist's schedule. This can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months to ship out after the live stream ends.  **When is the live stream?**  At the time of this posting,no exact date is announced. Once listed, the above chart will be updated. All live streams are recorded and uploaded at a future date for reviewing in case you missed it.  **Do I have to purchase to watch the live stream?**  No purchase necessary if you are just interested in watching the live stream. Feel free to join us on the stream date regardless!  **Have more questions?** Just comment below and we will answer them to the best of my ability

1aa5c8	-30786	1363265997	leagueoflegends	My champion select idea	In my opinion they should implement an "Team builder" mode, with votekick, no time limit and without asking for roles. So that way when the team is completely ready they can start to find (automatically) a challenger team to select the champions and begin the game.Anyone should be allowed to quit the team, and another player will be randomly added. This should solve the problem when more than one people are asking for mid for example.Should take a little time, but i think would work.edit. i'm thinking about the vote kick... if there is a quit button there is no need to vote kick. if a player is not ok with this team, this player should leave.

[Dark Psy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuMkZsoTVcU): "tend to be more haunting than uplifting".3. [Progressive psy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijfnmwNfOYA): Lots of bass without losing psychedelic environment in a "slow" and clean music.4. ["Night" Full-on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGWFegKWlMA):  Dark elements, high BPM (speed).5.

2jclwq	-30786	1413403862	ClashOfClans	[MISC] About Clash of Clans Economy in TH9/TH10	I play this game for more than a year, and i'm feeling that getting loot is increasingly harder by time.If you want more loot you have several options :1. Climb trophies to masters or above, and get wrecked because you are farming and don't have everything upgraded.2. Stay around gold and spend your day pressing the next button trying to barch or giant/archer like 99% of the ppl around there.3. Try to mix #1 and #2 in crystal league because 20k bonus should cover some next'sWhats the point for the next button to cost gold ? I mean, this is a fixed value, and the bases i'm getting something useful are harder to find. For me this is inflation. Could make sense if this changes by trophy range, but not by TH lvl.If there is more ppl playing, there is less loot for everyone.What's your TH, trophy range and how's your farming ?

It seems chromecast needs to open a netflix native app then open some content (movie) inside it, and the first time i'm doing that, it throws an error on google cast extension. Second time i do that, the netflix app on chromecast is already loaded and starts to stream my movie right away.IF i select to cast before selecting any movie, it will stream my tab to chromecast, and will not load "netflix app" (im not sure its an app, but its not streaming from my computer).When i try to do this from my cellphone, i open netflix app and select my chromecast then the thing i want to see, this way i never got any problems.TL;DR: Netflix from website throws an error the first time i try to cast.Anyone with similar issues ?

354sh8	-30786	1430966316	networking	Advice for networking in a 40-person company	I need some networking advice for ~~my company~~ the company i work for, we have currently 40 employees but we're growing.We Currently have :* 3 Different ISPs, 1 Cable, 2 DSL (one of them is kinda slow).* 2x 24-port switch* 150mbps half-n wifi router on 1st floor.* old 54mbps router on 2nd floor (less than 10 ppl, we dont have problems here).* We dont use our local network a lot, we are more internet-based, files are generally stored on cloud.* ~5-10 notebooks who can go to skype meetings on wifi. We have remote ppl who comes once a week and use wifi, sometimes clients too.* Everyone's smartphone is connected to wifi.* ~30 wired desktop computers, ~5 server/printer/etcI'm thinking this may blow if we grow a little more, wi-fi is dropping once a while, switches are almost full, and if a ISP drops we have to set our IP to manual and change the gateway address.* There is any simple way to change ISPs in a easier way ?* Buying a cheap wifi and forcing all smartphones to use it, restricting the other one to serious stuff would would keep the 150mbps wifi reliable ?* Maybe forcing smartphones to the crappy DSL ISP since we dont care about them ?* Switch i think we have no option to buy another one, build a big one would be too expensive.Thanks!

d19tz	-30793	1281834568	funny	When bigotry backfires...	So my family had a party at our house today. My cousins were in the basement playing Wii Sports bowling.One of the Miis I made when I first got my Wii was Jesus, with darker, more realistic pigmentation than the blond-haired, blue-eyed whitened Jesus. He was Jesus of Nazareth, not Jesus of Austria. Bear in mind, I am not religious. I just thought it'd be cute to play Wii sports as Jesus. Evidently one of my cousins thought it cute too. He started a game of bowling against Mitch Hedberg and some other Mii I made years ago. I forget which player position he was, but his player color was red.It wasn't long before my aunt (his mother) came downstairs, took a look at the screen and asked, "Who's the terrorist in red?" Ya know, cuz he was brown and had a beard.This is a super Catholic woman who tried to "save my soul" some years ago. Blasphemy has never been more awesome. TL;DR - My aunt mistook a caricature of Jesus for that of a terrorist.

3g57h5	-30828	1438964563	askgaybros	Dating out of your league.	I get the feeling I am falling back into an old habit of attempting to sabotage relationships before something goes wrong. I met this older guy last week [I'm late 20s and he's turning 40 and age isn't an issue for either of us] and we went on a date and hit it off immediately. We have had a "date night" every day this week which may seem a bit fast to be that frequent but we both want to. I consider myself a 6 or 7 at best but he's a 10 in my book. He's IMO the perfect guy but in the back of my mind, I can't help but think he could do better than me or there is something wrong with him that he isn't admitting to. He does compliment me on my body and my personality as I do the same for him so the attraction is mutual. We haven't had sex yet so I dunno if there is any incompatibility there but I don't see any hangups from what we talked about. The only red flag I see is that he was a bit of a globetrotter, teaching English in various countries [he's a polyglot too] and he's never had a serious relationship which might signal commitment issues but I think that's just me overthinking. I know rating someone is subjective and I don't think my self-esteem is terrible to not attract a "10" for me but like I said, I almost feel like he is dating beneath what he could attract.

To give you an idea of what I mean, the most common example of this is when a movie starts out lighthearted but then something darker happens and that overshadows the rest of the film.I don't mean movies that just mix genres like a violent action movie with lots of comedy, or something like that. The switch should happen at a certain point in the film. Also note that I don't just mean plot twists, though obviously that overlaps.So I know just telling me the movie title is kind of a spoiler, but please try to avoid explicit spoilers like giving me the exact details of the scene.I know I laid out a lot of specific rules, so I really appreciate all your suggestions.

So last year, Criterion's master: **The All-Powerful Wes Anderson**, finally broke the barrier that seemed to lay between Criterion and animation with the release of "The Fantastic Mr. Fox". I am aware that they had previously released Akira on laserdisc, and that Brakhrage is technically animation, but this still seemed like a good step towards acknowledging animation in the collection.What films would you like to see added? Personally, I think *The Thief and the Cobbler* would be an excellent edition if they could get the rights to it, and release it in the "Recobbled Cut" form. I don't know the legality of all that though.*Allegro Non Troppo*, the Italian Fantasia parody, would be a good choice. Jiri Trnka would be another obvious choice, at least an Eclipse set would be great to see. I would also love it if they did *The King and the Mockingbird*. Anyway, I'd like to know what films you think they should release, or even just expand on any of my choices.

What I want out of Study Abroad is to experience somewhere that's different from the US by a good margin (I only speak English so this limits me), somewhere where I can meet and hopefully make friends with locals, and also if I'm honest, I want somewhere where I can drink and party a lot.Obviously this is my choice to make, but I was just wondering if you guys had any input.

2udmsv	-30829	1422765658	FilmsExplained	[Request] Marley and Me	So my friends and I have two differing opinions on this film. I think the dog was dead the whole time, which seems like the most obvious explanation. However my friend insists that the dog was alive, but in the scene where Owen Wilson gets angry at it he actually kills it in a fit of rage. The rest of the movie is his delusions trying to deny the event, until finally he accepts it by killing the dog off in his fantasy.Who is right? Or is there a different explanation entirely? This seems like a film that could have endless interpretations, but there has to be one that's better than the others.

I'm writing my attempt at a comedy story, and there a few points in it where the narrator will make a snarky aside to the audience. Basically joking about how unlikely the situation is, or how stupid a character's choice is. I have mixed feelings about this. I kind of like those moments in my particular story, but having read other things with somewhat similar jokes I realize I am often annoyed by this. It makes me think "Cool, you realize you're writing a work of fiction, how clever of you to acknowledge that".I'm curious as to your opinions on this, and any tips you might have for what can make these types of jokes good or bad.

It would serve as the tipping point for my main character to become a very different person (after many other factors have built up).Is there a "right" way to do them? Should they be done at all? How long can you make them last before they become tedious? Should you describe it as if it is actually happening or keep reminding the audience it isn't real?Just wondering if you guys had any thoughts/advice/warnings on these in writing. Obviously it's all a matter of opinion, so don't feel like you have to say "anything goes". In my particular case I'm speaking about a drug trip, but I'd like to keep it somewhat open-ended so that anyone can benefit.

Something that you don't necessarily want to be seen by others, but can be interesting to write for yourself.

3boaei	-30829	1435696410	changemyview	CMV: The glorification of illicit topics in fiction (such as Fifty Shades of Grey) is not immoral	I have heard many people on Reddit state that *Fifty Shades of Grey* is bad not just because of the shitty writing, but also because it celebrates an abusive relationship. My view is that one of the most attractive elements of fiction is to revel in things that are not feasible/accepted in the world we live in. Erotica often deals in the taboo, and I believe that there is nothing wrong with that. I don't see a difference between getting sexual pleasure out of reading the abuse in *Grey*, and say, the rush of excitement you get when Walter White blows shit up. Neither would get the same reactions in real life, but when presented in the comfort of a separate fiction world, they give us enjoyment. I believe a clear line exists between fantasy and reality, and that enjoying something in fantasy does not translate to enjoying it in reality.That's my view, now change it._____&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

3ch6v0	-30829	1436305835	TrueFilm	"The Silence" (1963)	What I enjoyed the most about this film was the mysterious qualities of the hotel, and the city it occupies. The tanks and the siren suggest a city at war, but the location is never named, it could be anywhere. The language spoken there is seemingly fictional. The hotel also seems mysterious. In a special feature I watched about the film, the film historian (Peter Cowie) references the hotel in *Last Year at Marienbad*, and I too see the similarities. Cowie also referred to the location as a type of "No Man's Land", and I find that description very apt.I also was intrigued by the porter and the troupe of dwarfs that we meet. They both communicate physically with the main characters rather than verbally, and they both possess a childlike sense of imagination/fun when interacting with Johan. However, Johan more readily accepts the dwarfs, while he is at first intimidated by the porter (perhaps due to size). The porter is also a source of comfort for Ester, staying by her side at the end, even as her sister and nephew leave. He seems to be the kindest person in the film.I'm interested in your thoughts on the unnamed city/hotel, the porter, and the dwarf troupe. What meaning do you think they bring to the film?Feel free to discuss anything else about this film that you want to of course, the above are simply things I was most curious about.

3ckxv0	-30829	1436380885	TrueFilm	"Have You Seen...?" by David Thomson (book)	Was wondering if anyone has read this book before, and recommending it if you haven't. David Thomson is probably best known for his book "The Biographical Dictionary of Film", but I enjoyed this book a lot more.The book is simply 1,000 pages talking about 1,000 different films, from A-to-Z. They are not his favorite films, or the most popular films, but simply films he thought were worth mentioning. This means we get his opinions ranging from hatred to love.One thing I loved about this book was the condensed nature of his essays on the films. They are usually only 4-5 paragraphs, and jump around wildly to different topics. They might focus in on the cinematography, the dialogue, the relation to other works of the director, whatever Thomson feels is pertinent to mention. They give a brief snapshot of how he views the films, then move on. In this way he admittedly leaves much to be desired, but also much to be discovered the next time you watch. He's like shepherd, giving you only a slight nudge, but just enough so that you keep venturing forward, deeper into the themes of the film.Fair warning, you may get pissed off at times while reading this. He can often come off as an asshole. Sometimes I would think: "How dare he say that about this film?" But this is because he is unapologetic in his opinions, and doesn't feel the need to qualify them no matter how unpopular they may be. While this may be maddening at times, it is an effective way to open up new perspectives on films. This book does not restate what hundreds of other critics have said about a film, rather it explores areas you might never have thought of before. He does not tread a well-worn or easy path when speaking of even the most revered and extensively analyzed films. This is an extremely valuable quality and why I consider it one of my favorite books about the movies.

Spencer is an 8 month old pup who was originally taken to the Shelter I work at back in February after being found on the side of the highway.  He was adopted but when the new family found out he would need surgery to repair a previous injury, they had to return him to our shelter because they couldn't afford the surgery. Unfortunately, even though we strive to be no kill, we are an extremely tiny shelter, and an animal being returned needing that much surgery is just not something we would be able to afford. He would have been in danger of being euthanized, until his new awesome family stepped up to take him home!            Spencer has recently been adopted by a loving local family and he is now enjoying his forever home. His new family needs your help though. Spencer has a shattered hip and broken leg. He was injured before he was brought into the shelter, and for him to make a full recovery, he will need extensive surgery. The procedure is estimated to cost between $1000 and $2000 and will be completed by a qualified veterinarian. The exact cost will be determined once the procedure is finished and Spencer is in recovery. If there are any funds left over from the donations for Spencer's surgeries, they will be donated to help the other animals in need at the Shelter they adopted him from. Please think about donating anything you are able and help improve Spencer's quality of life.***Word from the Adoptive Family***He's a very sweet dog and he loves everything!  We think he is just thankful to be alive.  He deserves a second chance and to live out the rest of his life without pain and disability.  He's doing great - he loves our dogs and he's so sweet. We have over 3 acres, so he will have lots of room to play once he is done with his recovery. Also, any extra donations that are received will be donated to the Shelter which he was adopted from to help other needy animals get the loving homes they deserve!**tl;dr** We've found Spencer his wonderful new home, now if you are able, help his new family give him the lie he deserves!!

I dropped it off and got a call back today from the mechanic. He said that the intercooler sucked all of the oil out of the engine and dumped it into my turbo, which caused it to break, so  i'm looking at $2000-2500 in repairs. In the past, I opted not to have a different mechanic replace my radiator and saved about $900 in the process.  I have no problem having him do the work, but realistically, is this something I can do myself?

I'm buying my buddy around $80 in Legion units (technically $100, but I'm getting him a template set, dice, and tokens also) and I need some help picking out units to buy. He currently has a battle box, a shepherd, and a feralgeist. I'm trying to get him to a solid 35pt list with (maybe) a couple extra units to swap in and out. I'm okay with spending more if it's a "must have" kind of thing, but I would like to keep the units at around $80. Any recommendations?

I know I need to replace all 4, but is there a way I can convince insurance to cover the other 2?

2iie24	-30886	1412644643	subaru	How much can I realistically expect to get for a dealer trade in vs selling it private party? (04 WRX)	TL;DR I want to get a new car and i'm looking for a realistic ball park on how much I can get for my '04 WRX.I'm in a position now that I can get a newer car and I'm weighing the option of just trading it in and not dealing with the bullshit, or selling it private party. The car is an '04 WRX Premium. I've upgraded the audio significantly and haven't done any major changes to it otherwise. The engine is in good mechanical shape and, as far as I know right now, just needs an accessory belt replaced. The bad things about the car are: * trunk is pretty messed up. It's all cosmetic damage, but the previous owner put a carbon fiber trunk on it and decided against getting a UV coating on it, so most of the coating has peeled off.* I had an issue with my turbo a few years ago and had it replaced by a friend of a friend. You get what you pay for because he got an ebay turbo and the car has a whine when I accelerate now. There aren't any performance issues with it though, but the whine is annoying. * I smoked in the car for a few years, but haven't done so in a year (Cigarette free for 12 months since the first)* The driver side carpet is a little ripped, but nothing major.* Minor dings on the outer body.I get my oil changed with full synthetic every 3-4k miles and have a mechanic do regular maintenance.Looking at prices on the internet, I'm seeing a really wide range of what I can expect for a trade-in and for a private party. I'm seeing some 04s go for 10-12k through private party, but some trade-in sites saying don't expect more than 2k.So, what should I realistically expect for my car?Edit: Forgot to mention that I'm in Florida.

2ug65i	-30889	1422827725	smashbros	Just one small request as someone who doesn't really watch Smash	Hey, I really started getting into smash and Apex is my first big tournament I'm watching and it's really cool. However, the thing that really gets to me is when the commentators are really visibly being biased towards one of the players. I don't mind them pointing out mistakes or anything like that, but it just makes it kind of annoying to watch when even commentators are obviously rooting for a player to win. In my humble not-good-at-smash opinion, it's a lot more enjoyable to watch a game when the commentators at least make it seem like both players have equal support behind them. Just my two cents.

I'm now level 24 and on Faimon 5 (normal) with a couple 5* and such and on my second week of playing. My question is what am I supposed to be doing? I feel so behind because EVERYONE is talking about fusing their next nat 5* and clearing b10 and stuff like that, while I'm just here chilling hoping that I at least get a Raoq drop or something. Just a lot of tips would REALLY help. I've gone through tons and tons of guides trying to see which monsters are useful and the farming locations and everything, and rune set ups and everything, but I'm not even sure what my progression level is supposed to be or if I'm supposed to be struggling on the campaign normal maps... All the notes and guides out there seem to assume you're already level 40 and know all the little aspects of the game already. If someone is willing to kindly give some little noobie tips for a dumb player like me that would be amazing... I can post my box of monsters too if needed. Sorry if something like this is not allowed or redundant. EDIT: http://i.imgur.com/7N16f4Lh.jpg my box

My issue is filling the last spot, because my Ahman is only 20k HP and feels very squishy. He's on violent energy and 100% cr.

3ea3d3	-30889	1437621273	summonerswar	[BUG] Passive skills not using accuracy?	Hey guys I don't wanna have any knee jerk reactions here but I've noticed that even with 85% accuracy, my Aqcus doesn't DoT the dungeons with high resistance the majority of the time. However, he is able to apply debuffs perfectly fine with his second skill. I heard similar things with Tesarion and his passive, so I have high suspicions that perhaps the same bug exists? When I'm home later I can record a video (iPhone 6, iOS8.2).

3ewonn	-30889	1438096915	summonerswar	Aqcus Passive Bug: Video and Statistical Analysis	Hey, I recently noticed that my Aqcus wasn't DoTing as frequently as I would have thought - especially with 84% accuracy. Like most people though, I just brushed it off as poor RNG. However, I've decided to test if it really is just confirmation bias or not. EDIT: I know this has been happening with Tesarion, hence the footnote :p However I'm certain this is a bug because it's different from the interactions that all the other normal skills have. I'm just documenting it and showing proof so there's solid recollection of the event happening rather than just hearsay.EDIT 2: Turns out many other passives do in fact take into account their accuracy. For example there's good evidence in the comments of Hwa working, and screenshots of a [100% resistance Hwadam](http://imgur.com/8tPDAwW) getting [armor broken by a Jultan](http://imgur.com/gLK6hHg) (screenshots courtesy of /u/angelv255).**Monsters*** *Belladeon* | 60% Accuracy : Comparing between two different monsters, because his Skill 1 is 100% chance - just like Aqcus' passive.* *Aqcus* | 84% Accuracy: Obviously, to test him out. Testing both his Skill 2's percentage (100% normally without accuracy) compared to his passive (also 100% normally assuming crit [Aqcus has 99% crit]).*****Skills*** **Belladeon** &gt; **Skill 1 (Armor Break)**: 100% Chance to land without accuracy. This is identically to Aqcus' passive, and provides a consistent comparison from a different monster.* **Aqcus**&gt;**Passive Skill:** 100% Chance to land without accuracy. Applies on both skill 1 and skill 2. Only counting the attacks that crit (only one attack in the whole test did not crit). The main test subject.&gt;**Skill 2 (Attack Debuff/Attack Speed Debuff):**Both have 100% Chance to land without accuracy. This was used as another test comparison to see if the monster itself was bugged or simply his passive. ***[The data!](http://imgur.com/JCC7J4V) with the [video of the battles and the stats of the monsters](https://youtu.be/WnpRu0jlIlM). (Video may still be processing).The test was conducted in boss room of Hall of Magic B10. This is because we will be only testing against a single enemy to have only one resistance value we are testing against.Three trials were conducted to give a larger sample size. **Expected Outcome**: We would assume, if everything were to be working as it should be, that all the three last columns of success (Aqcus' skills) percentages should be nearing the same - high - percent, while Belladeon's should be about the same but perhaps a little bit lower if the boss has a resistance higher than 75 (because the minimum resistance can be reduced to is 15).&gt; This is because all three skills have an expected success rate. This means they should all converge towards a similar percentage of success. **Experimental Outcome*** What actually ended up happening was that we saw Belladeon's accuracy working perfectly: nearly 85% of her armor breaks landed. This means that (again, assuming everything else is correct) that we can assert the boss's resistance to be equal to or smaller than 75.* However, some strange occurances happened for our poor shark friend. Because we had already calculated previously Belladeon's skills, we already know that the boss has a resistance lower than 75. Therefore, we can expect a success rate of around 85% for all of our shark's tests. First, we can look at skill 2. &gt;*Combining the n from both parts of the skill (the Atk/Atkspeed debuffs) because we are assuming they're both working the same way, we have the two success rates of both parts of the skill (72.72% and 90.90%) that average to 81.18% - a little bit lower than our expected 85%, but that's going to happen seeing our relatively small sample size (22 when combined). We can generally assume that this skill is working quite fine too. **Passive**&gt;*However for our passive, we have an astoundingly low success rate - 17%! This is especially surprising, considering the passive had the largest N out of all our tests, so we would expect it to be the closest to our expected. Instead, we're left with a number that's the lowest of all the samples with the largest sample size. *****Conclusion:**The shark's passive ability is bugged, unable to use the monster's accuracy for it's application. Despite the fact that Aqcus has near max accuracy and a 100% chance to apply the DoT, the resulting percentage of success is much too low to be correct. ****Aside*: I would encourage those with Tesarion to try going to Hall of Magic B10 and seeing your success with his passive there. I would assume much of what I see here with Aqcus.

You would simply just do what you want to do and take what you want to take without worrying about it.The mere fact that TRP'ers have to create support groups for eachother and identify as TRP'ers, is pathetic. I almost feel sorry for these kids because they are genuinely unhappy. But they are coping with it by trying to drag others down with them, and that is despicable. They are behaving in the exact way they accuse feminists of behaving, i.e. belittling the other gender and seeking every opportunity to establish dominance.Here's an idea, stand up for yourself, and bring the human race up with you.
2ujpq2	-30890	1422904913	StarWars	One of the best quotes of the franchise was from Revenge of the Sith.	The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them do not. Miss them do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed that is.Train yourself to let go... of everything you fear to lose. 
2ux2qo	-30890	1423174507	atheism	My kids watch Veggie Tales on Netflix, and it bothers me.	Before this my wife's aunt and grandma would sometimes give our kids presents, that would sometimes be christian story books and shit. One time it was Veggie Tales and my kids watched it. But later I threw it away.That didn't do me much good because now my kids are watching Veggie Tales on Netflix pretty frequently, and we don't stop them. My wife convinced me it's just a show like any other cartoon, so it will be ingested the same. But the thing I hate so much about Veggie Tales, is the characters stop their little skit and kind of talk directly to the audience with a "matter of fact" lessons they are trying to teach. They aren't subtle about it at all, just directly brainwash kids into thinking comfortable thoughts. Such as, "You have nothing to fear, because God is watching over you."My son is very sensitive and worries about things sometimes, so I am now worried he will latch on to this. Now my son's been asking questions, "Is God watching over me? Is god on my team?" We just explain "some people believe there is a god, and some people don't." We also say, "But we're your parents, and we are watching over you and protecting you."I have never explicitly told our kids that I don't believe in god. My wife is kind of agnostic but she's open to "spirituality" in some sense. She defends respecting religious belief, but I'm pretty much militant atheist, and think religious belief is harmful and poisonous.I try to emphasize in private to my son, "Even adults don't know everything. Some adults think pretend things are real, and some adults think real things are pretend." I've also said things like, "Ghosts aren't real, but some people think they are." And, "Some people believe in aliens in space, and some don't. I think they probably do exist."I wonder if there is anything more/different I should be doing. I don't want to force any belief onto my kids except for being kind to others. I feel like I should hold off on initiating discussion of the philosophical issues of religion/supernatural until my son is older and asks more specific questions. (He is 5 now).

The doctor said it's fine, and my body will absorb it. But it is uncomfortable, and bothers me to have such a visible lump on the side of my throat. Anything I can do to make the body absorb it faster? Sleep on it? Head elevated or lay flat? Massage it or leave it alone? Neck exercises?UPATE: Turns out it was not a blood clot, but swelling and fluids (Wallbrack called it) gathering due to post-surgery infection. The thing kept getting bigger until one night at dinner it burst, and a bunch of orange-brown slimy-stinky blood drained out of it. Now I've been getting it cleaned out 1-2 times a day and on clindamycin. My ENT seems pretty knowledgable and capable, but turns out he guessed wrong the first time, and says it's the first time he's seen this happen.

376ff9	-30890	1432537441	dating_advice	advise for out-of-practice online dating dinosaur	Ok, I'm 37, just getting separated and moving into my own place. I have two kids, and both wife and I are completely happy separating and just being friends/parents/family.Me being the type that fears being alone more than anything else, I start looking at online dating sites. I joined "Zoosk" and met this 38yo woman who is awesome and sweet. We met because we both clicked "yes" on eachother, or something. Anyway, she said she likes my profile, blah blah, she is new to this and not sure about meeting someone online, etc, but she wants to just chat for now.Ok so we chat for awhile that night. She did ask about  my separation, and I told her, and said it was a good sign that I get along with my ex. So to me, this means she approves. Hooray, moving forward!but then over the next two days her responses come farther and farther about, now it has been over a day. Not a big deal but I can also see she has been online and looked at my profile.I guess I am quite insecure in this aspect of my personality. Really this whole thing took place over less than 3 days. I barely know the girl and I'm acting like this. It's stupid. But she is my type and a good match for me.Ok, so I messaged her again for the last time on Zoosk and told her I plan on quitting Zoosk, but I am interested in speaking with her again. I gave her my email.I find it just really odd that she won't respond. I wonder if she got scared away by the online thing or she decided against dealing with a guy just newly separated. Maybe I just need to be more secure and likewise more PATIENT. Maybe she has just been busy, tired, or maybe she just isn't too comfortable yet but may still warm up to the idea of continuing our chats? She is a professional woman and coincidentally lives pretty closeby.I am not a creep but I actually used google to find her, based on her profession and first name. And yeah, there she is, same picture, and she works VERY close to me, and I have been a client there...The stalker in me wants to go down there and meet her face to face and say hi. But I'm not insane so I won't do that, don't worry. Should I still have any hope that she will respond, or should I force myself to drop this whole thing?Thanks, sorry for being crazy. And I am stoned too.
3cu88o	-30890	1436560638	OnlineDating	i need some basic advice to make a good first impression	I have had a couple dates from online dating apps, they were ok and nothing much came from them. But I have one coming up next week that I am SUPER FUCKING EXCITED about, because this girl is simply fantastic, as in I would marry her in a heartbeat even though I've never met her face-to-face yet.  Foolish and stupid? Yeah, I know. But that doesn't change the fact that it's of utmost importance I don't mess it up! I need to CHILL, and be confident and fun and mostly normal (as opposed to the quirky awkward weird guy I can be sometimes).  What are some suggestions to get myself in the 'groove' of loving life, loving who I am, so that I can just be myself and have fun with this?  Thanks!

Contest is simple, pick a number from 1-666 and tell me why would you like the game. Good luck I'll contact the winner here on Reddit with the key. I will pick the winner through random.org and the one who gets the closest to the number wins.EDIT: The giveaway will end when this post gets 24 hours old, forgot to mention that sorry.Winner- /u/MidKnight_Corsair

yoraj	-30906	1345711759	movies	Can we get a petition to have David Yates, the extraordinary director of many of the Harry Potter films to direct The Justice League? 	David Yates, along with many other incredibly gifted directors, took up the helm of the Harry Potter films and did so with such a brilliant vision. His films are a provocative portrail of a fantasy landscape that is so tactile and rich with detail and heart that seemingly anything is possible and believable. This is the environment that a Justice League movie should be bred and thrive upon. A landscape where a number of heavy hitting characters all live simultaneously, personally interacting and simply living and breathing. Their supernatural powers of great magnitude need to be treated with the creativity and care that they were in the Harry Potter films. David Yates pallet of rich color, detail and respect for the material is what the Justice League so desperately needs and with a dark reality that could greatly separate itself from what Marvel is doing and really create something beautiful.I dunno, I think he's a perfect fit and hope that some of you feel the same.

1s516x	-30906	1386219608	gaming	My gaming franchises are dying..	I feel that myself and few others are being swept under the FPS shooter and Open World rug. I am both a fan of boxing games and skating games. I fear the days of the beautiful simplicity of these games and their power are long gone. I once looked forward to the releases of games like Fight Night or Skate, I mean hell I craved realism but even a few of the last Tony Hawk games were still fun in their own way. I dont know if im ready to let these franchises go and now with this big beautiful PS4, I cant help but wonder what a hyper realistic skating or boxing game would be like. tl;dr a ramble about how the future of realistic boxing and skating games seems to be in serious jeopardy and it makes me sad.

Anyone who has tried to cancel a membership with RetroFitness knows the totally unnecessary hoops that you have to jump through, but why the run around? I am being told that I have back payments and to get in touch with ABC Financial Group, who coincidently said they cant help me either? I am just simply trying to put stop to them from trying to charge a debit card that I dont even use any longer due to identity theft and cancel my membership because I moved. ABC said that there's an auto-renewal clause in the contract so that they can just simply continue to charge you, despite never being told about this when signing up. I was told it was an annual membership and that it would only be active for a year!I wanted to join a gym not sign up for a mortgage or take out a loan! Upon looking into the Googles, it seems that every person that has something to say about ABC and RF has had the same run around, most of which were still looking for solutions after months of attempting to cancel to no avail. How do they get away with it? Any advice on how to get out?

I've been playing around with some songs that incorporate tons of palm mutes in quick succession, and I've noticed that I can't alternate pick while palm muting. Well, I can do it, but the notes I down stroke always seem to be cut off when I play at speed. When I play the palm muted sections with only down strokes, everything sounds just fine, but I get a bit more sloppy with the playing. I've watched videos of the artist preforming the songs in question, and they just strum out the whole song just fine.

So if I send 5 messages on one channel, and 5 on another, am I at 10/20 messages commands per 30 seconds, or am I only at 5? I'm trying to expand my bot a little, but having it reply in multiple streams and minding the rate limit is causing a bit of wait time between responses.

306i2r	-30918	1427233320	BabyBumps	Severe Miscarriage Anxiety	After 3 ivf attempts I finally conceived last summer. My husband and I have been married for 10 years and have been trying for 5. I was so excited to get the bfp for the first time in my life. It was exhilarating! I didn't feel anxious or sick at all and was "glowing" at 6.5 weeks when we saw the little heartbeat. At 8.5 weeks an ultrasound showed that the heart stopped beating with no real explanation and we were heartbroken, but excited to try again as soon as possible. We tried again and I am now 14 weeks with twins. Our 12 week ultrasound looked great, and, according to my OB, things look as good as they can at this point. I, however, have been truly anxious and sick ever since I got the bfp. I can't seem to allow myself to be as excited as everyone around me. I wake up every night in the middle of the night with horrible anxiety that I am going to miscarry and lay awake thinking of all the "ifs" involved. This has made me somewhat depressed and I wish I could feel the way I did the first time: happy and relaxed. I know there is nothing I can do but wait and hang in there, but it is very challenging. How do I stop this anxiety from destroying my ability to enjoy all the odd and wonderful things about pregnancy?  
307sc5	-30918	1427255192	BabyBumps	When did your first trimester pregnancy nausea/vomiting go away?	I hate calling it "morning sickness" because for me it's been either all day sickness or extra bad at evening and in the middle of the night. I've missed several days at work due to being up the previous night dry heaving or puking. It's also hurt my social life not being able to stand going out to eat. Further, I haven't cooked for my poor husband in 2 months. I'm 14 weeks tomorrow and have had some slight relief on and off the past week. Hoping this is almost over. I miss liking food!Update: At 14 weeks, 3 days I have had 4 days now where I didn't feel sick at all until late evening. Last night I had the worst stomach ache and it was back full force. This morning I am fine. I am really hoping this is on its way out of my life. I have gained a lot of respect for women who go their whole pregnancy with crippling nausea and especially those who keep a full time job or take care of little kids at the same time. You are truly heroes! 
30frcx	-30918	1427415657	BabyBumps	By best friend of 20 years has just set her wedding date 3 days after my due date.	I get that she wants a September wedding, but I'm trying to convince her that I simply can't be there. It would require me to either travel across the country at 9 months pregnant, or bring along 2, very fresh, newborn babies. Not happening. She's banking on the idea that my twins will arrive early, or that I can leave them behind with my DH for a couple of days. I don't think I could do any of the above. Is my lack of experience blinding me here? Is it even possible to travel with babies that young, or being so pregnant? Thanks! Edit: Not to mention the fact that I might be recovering from a c-section due to twins...Updated thoughts: Great comments! Maybe I will just send my friend a link to this thread and perhaps she will get more of a clue about the whole labor/recovering/taking care of newborns process. I really think the problem is that her own lack of experience is what gave her the unrealistic idea that I could somehow attend the wedding. 
30icjl	-30918	1427475789	BabyBumps	I was a bit snotty to a coworker after her snide comment that I thought ridiculous. Perhaps I overreacted.	"I heard you're having twins. I'm so glad it's you and not me." I replied, "Me too! I'm so glad it's me who finally gets this wonderful experience!" And honestly, after years of fertility issues, I'm so glad it's me! 
30lyd8	-30918	1427559406	BabyBumps	Only 14.5 weeks and I already have the "everybody stare at the pregnant lady" syndrome.	Yes, I'm a slender gal AND carrying twins, so I am totally showing a lot already. Why does everyone have to stare at me? I wasn't ready for this. What other annoying things from the public should I be prepared for?

Painful cough, thick mucus and hardly any sleep the last 3 nights. I've done saline rinses, steamed, drinking fluids. My OB's nurse said there's not much I can do being barely into 2nd trimester but I am plain miserable. Am I forgetting something?

31dk6a	-30918	1428110882	BabyBumps	A Rant: My MIL from hell	My MIL has always hated me and blamed me for various things. A couple examples: I "took" her son away from the family's religion (even though he already left it 3 years prior to meeting me). She also blames me for not being able to have kids. Although being married young, at 20, I wanted to finish college first and after that we have struggled with fertility issues. She went ahead and made up horrible stories about why I won't just get pregnant already to everyone in our hometown (even though she knows I have fertility issues). One story is that I hate kids and won't let my husband have babies (did I mention I chose a career working with kids?) Another is that we are being cursed because we do not attend church. The latest is that I don't have a uterus... The list goes on. Anyway, for 10 years she has been hassling us to have kids, shoved adoption pamphlets in our faces and repeatedly brought it up the lack of baby situation every time she saw me. I always ignored her comments to my face or took it with grace, but would always end up in tears at home because really what she did was repeatedly rubbed salt in my wound. Now, after 5 years of fertility treatment I am pregnant with twins. Suddenly my MIL is being nice and saying "I love you" and "you are so good to my son" and such. This makes me want to vomit because she only now is okay with me because I'm pregnant. I have not reciprocated her "love" and "care" because I feel it is fake and I know that she still hates me. I can't just forget how she treated me for 11 years, so I'll admit I've been a little cold with her lately. The day my husband announced to his family I didn't answer her phone call. Should I just be the bigger person and let her smother me and by future babies with her grandmother love? Am I being stubborn?

31k925	-30918	1428271859	BabyBumps	In need of baby shower advice.	My problem is that I've lived so many different places and have close friends scattered across the country. I have a handful of good friends in my current town who want me to have a baby shower, but then it would be about 5 of us...lame. Even if I fly to my hometown for a shower I don't want to deal with shipping gifts back home. I've thought of doing an e-shower and registering on amazon. Is that a totally stupid idea? I'm not really big party-throwing person, so maybe it's fitting for me?

31srng	-30918	1428443284	BabyBumps	Carrying twins. First pregnancy. Need advice from those who have been through this!	I am 16 weeks and already look very pregnant. People started noticing as early as 10 weeks. It doesn't help that I am slender, so I have the whole snake-swallowed-a-basketball thing going on. My twins are fraternal with different sacks. Thus far they have measured almost exactly the same size, but have different faces.  One is always super visible and positioned perfectly for the ultrasound. The other likes to hide and point his/her head toward us. I am scared about what labor will be like. Is it best to schedule surgery? My OB said in 3rd tri I will have to be seen twice a week to check things out. What can I do about purchasing baby items? What can they share (crib?) what will I need 2 of? I was through the roof excited when I found out it's twins, but I have nothing to compare my experience with. I'd love any and all advice. Thanks! 
31x3tu	-30918	1428526859	BabyBumps	rant: So incredibly exhausted, 16 weeks!	I'm not sure if it's the pregnancy or the head cold I'm at the near end of but all I've done so far today is showered and ate waffles. The thought of grocery shopping or doing anything else on my list makes me want to cry. 
321wn1	-30918	1428618659	atheism	It's been building up for a while now, but I've become an atheist.	I grew up Mormon, but quit at 18, but called myself a Christian for years. Now that I'm in my 30's, with more life experience, I've grown into a total geek about science, humanism and environmentalism. I had a traumatic life event last year and thought I'd try to pray. I couldn't pray. It felt silly and juvenile. That's when I realized I don't believe in a God and have 0 spiritual beliefs left. I also feel like I've reached that point of no return. Once fully liberated from fantastical thinking the only thing that makes sense is the here and now. I also find myself caring more about this life and wanting to make the most of it. 
322bxp	-30918	1428626037	BabyBumps	I hate bras.	I used to be okay with bras, but I also didn't used to have hardly any boobs. They are hot, they itch, they tug, they give me under-boob acne. When I get home the first thing I do is take it off.
32qkw7	-30918	1429137204	BabyBumps	Maternity leave advice needed: Any pregnant teachers on here?	I am getting interviews for teaching positions this fall. I've taught full time before, but it's been a few years and I am in a new state/new district. Because of this I would sort of fall into "first year" category for benefits and leave and all that. My due date is in September, which is horrible. I've thought of just taking a whole year off since we can survive off of my husband's income only, but it won't be easy. I love teaching but am also dreading having twins in September and having to return to work too soon. Not to mention childcare costs. Any experience with this? Thanks! Edit: I am also showing, and the pregnancy will be obvious during interviews.
336pqt	-30918	1429493588	BabyBumps	The question you're never supposed to ask, but here I go: How much weight did you/have you gained with your twin pregnancy? No judging!	I'm 18 weeks, have gained 11 lbs. My OB says to expect to gain 55ish lbs with twins, which seems like QUITE A BIT, so I'm wondering what other moms have to say. Thanks! 
33juqs	-30918	1429756507	BabyBumps	Just discouraged and venting. Job interview while pregnant = I really screwed this one up.	I've been subbing for this school district for years and I even did a long term sub job last fall for them. I have 3 years of full time experience on top of it. The principal of one of the schools even wants to hire me. I finally get called for a hiring pool interview by the higher-ups in the district. I felt like an idiot afterwards. Pregnancy has made my brain fuzzy and I'm sure this had something to do with it. It's not the end of the world. It might be best if I just sub for another year while the twins are young, but it feels so bad to be rejected. It makes me never want to interview pregnant again. 
33k3fl	-30918	1429761234	BabyBumps	18 weeks. Twins. I can't tell if I'm feeling babies fluttering or gas, because I have a lot of that in my belly too.	Do early quickenings feel like gas?
33o3j0	-30918	1429842991	BabyBumps	Watermelon, finally! I've been craving it since January. It's finally in season.	
33xd6c	-30918	1430062275	parentsofmultiples	When did your twins arrive?	I am nearing 20 weeks and this is my first viable pregnancy. I've read that bed rest in the third trimester and early labor is common with twins. I have no reason to think I'd go early other than it's twins, but it is a fear of mine. If you have a story to share, I'd love to hear it!Edit: Thank you for sharing your stories! This has been extremely helpful!  
34ba3i	-30918	1430337040	BabyBumps	What are some fun, pregnancy hobbies?	I've found that all my hobbies are too dangerous to do during my twin pregnancy. (mountain biking, rock climbing, backpacking, motorcycling...) My social life is practically built around these hobbies and now I'm feeling secluded and bored. I know I'll be plenty busy when the babies come, but for now, any suggestions? 
34fqxi	-30918	1430423010	BabyBumps	My solution to prevent the strangers' "They must have your due date wrong" comment.	I am skinny and carrying twins and so my belly is huge already.  I tell strangers that I'm due in July (really, I'm due in September). It totally works. No further explanation needed. As I get bigger, I'll probably up the due date :D 
34kamv	-30918	1430517597	BabyBumps	Everything I ever wanted all in one ultrasound.	I went in for an un-related pregnancy issue and the doctor decided to scan the babies anyway. I am going to have a baby girl AND a baby boy! My real anatomy scan is in 5 days and hoping so much for healthy development. 
35c7p6	-30918	1431123940	BabyBumps	20 week anatomy scan of my boy/girl twins was normal! Relief!	The boy is just one ounce heavier than the girl. I think it's his penis. 
35c8uq	-30918	1431124552	BabyBumps	Job interview pregnant. What do I wear?	After living in a few different states, I know that professional attire can vary quite a bit. That being said, I live in the greater Seattle area and this is an elementary teacher interview. I'd say this district is slightly more formal compared with others I've worked for in other states. My suit pants definitely don't fit and neither does my long pencil skirt. (I'm very much showing with no mistake). I can't go spend $100+ on maternity suit pants right now. Can I get away with a solid colored-classy, knee-length dress and a maternity blazer? 
35eln3	-30918	1431188516	parentsofmultiples	Mammas of twins: Is going back to work 5 half days a week realistic 6 weeks after having babies?

362yie	-30918	1431711301	BabyBumps	Im in the middle of 2nd trimester and I've been having very mild, menstrual feeling cramps here and there. Is this normal?	It's not even and every day thing -more like every few days. This is my first and I'm trying to decide if it is normal. I've read some places that some cramping can be normal, but other times I freak out because I've also read that cramps can indicate preterm labor. Thanks for any insight! 
3635op	-30918	1431714631	parentsofmultiples	Did you use a belly support band while pregnant with twins?	I'm only 21 weeks, and I look more like my friend who is 32 weeks. My doctor recommended a belly band. If you used one, what brand and would you recommend it? Thank you!

36ucuf	-30918	1432270087	BabyBumps	My favorite time of day: I lay down in bed at night and feel my babies kick. So funny and so adorable.	
36xetr	-30918	1432333650	BabyBumps	Try swimming all my pregnant friends!	I haven't been able to run since 8 weeks. Now, at 22 weeks, walking my usual couple miles a day gives me horrible cramps and doctor says, "don't," so the last couple of days I tried swimming. I'm not great at it, but it feels so good to move around in the water and to have the weightless feeling for a short amount of time. I can do SOMETHING physical. Relief! 
3724xo	-30918	1432439606	BabyBumps	Approaching end of 2nd trimester and thinking of buying a house. Is this insane?	My husband and I are renting a nice home that we could start our family in, but we got approved for a very low interest rate loan and could buy a house right now for about what we're paying rent each month in our current neighborhood, which we love. It all sounds so fun, but the timing sucks. Twin pregnancy is kicking my ass and I wouldn't be able to do so much as pack dishes at this point. We could get help from relatives and hire movers, but I'm worried about adding more stress to a stressful pregnancy. Sign another year lease or buy a house? Any thoughts? thanks.  
37h2hd	-30918	1432742910	BabyBumps	My sister texts and/or calls me every day to ask if my babies are still alive.	My sister is a very emotional, sensitive and sentimental person to begin with and she had a late miscarriage/still born 7 years ago when she was 25 weeks pregnant. The baby had died at 20ish weeks but she had never felt much movement before and didn't know the difference, so they didn't catch it sooner. It was a freak thing with the placenta- nothing genetic or anything like that. She had a full on funeral and she still visits the grave often. She cries every birthday and mothers day. Because of this she will probably never try to get pregnant again. It's a really sad situation and it sucks that it had to happened to her.  I am now 23 weeks pregnant, FTM. She texts me every day and asks things like this: "Are the babies still kicking today?" "Can you hear the heartbeats?" "Do you feel like you're not alone?" "Do you feel pregnant still?" I am fully aware that miscarriage is always a possibility, and already being a pregnant, hormonal, bag of nerves, I don't need this daily reminding. Do I just suck it up and let her do this my entire pregnancy because I know she is sensitive? Am I just being a jerk or is it time to say something? What would I even say? I am so opposite of her and don't speak her hyper-sensitive, emotional language so well.  
37h3yx	-30918	1432743529	raisedbynarcissists	Have any of you raised your own kids in the same town as your borderline/narcissist parent? Advice?	My mother is the definition of borderline personality disorder (and very narcissist). She's been fairly tame the past couple of years, but in the past has done some pretty shitty things. I'm giving birth to twins in a few months, living 20 minutes away. She has acted fairly cool about the pregnancy in a normal-grandma sort of way, but I fear for the future because I know how shitty and damaging she can be. 
37jqk3	-30918	1432782669	atheism	Atheist parents: How do you deal with religious folks while wanting to raise your kids to be critical thinkers?	I'm jumping the gun a bit here- I'm not a parent yet, but will have twins in 3ish months. Lucky for my husband and I, having escaped the mormon cult a long time ago, we get to raise our kids in a mostly non-mormon community. I do, however, worry about when kids visit religious relatives or hear about religious this and thats. Friends and family already have expressed their spiritual beliefs about my unborn children such as, "These little spirits chose you to be their mom," and "From God's arms to your arms..." Mind you, the only reason why I am pregnant is because some amazing scientists invented IVF. Pregnancy is really quite amazing and I love my babies, but I don't have spiritual beliefs. To me, it's biology. 
37jrpe	-30918	1432783273	BabyBumps	My twin preggo friends: How are you feeling? (this is mostly a vent) I'm wimpy.	My uterus today measured to be 29 weeks, but I am only 23 weeks. This means I'm huger than huge for this stage and really feeling it. I'm hardly able to work any hours right now and the couch is my new best friend. I am hungry and thirsty all the time and walking down the street is exhausting. My back is hurting and I'm already dripping pee. I hope that I am wrong about this, but I worry that I won't be able to walk in another month. I've always been a tough and fit gal, but I feel so wimpy and pathetic right now. 
37n4rh	-30918	1432847860	BabyBumps	Pregnancy has literally turned me into a baby.	I cry, I pee myself, I am off balance when walking, I throw up, I don't sleep through the night and most recently I've been spilling everything I eat on my belly. Do they make adult bibs?

Is it okay to just set up a crib and get some diapers? How complicated does this have to be? I just want my little ones to be cozy and loved. Thanks! Edit: Thanks everyone for making me feel okay about my lack of nesting. I guess everyone is different and we all have to do what we're comfortable with.  
385v9e	-30918	1433209990	BabyBumps	Worst night ever rant	I started having strong period-like cramps OR constipation cramps (I can't tell) around 11pm that went on all night. I don't think it was contractions because my belly didn't tighten. Then, I had what I think was round ligament pain really bad on the left side that wrapped around my hip to lower back. This all resulted in 0 sleep and an exhausting day. My husband stayed home to take care of me because I feel like I got ran over by a train. Things have calmed down for now after a couple of naps and bowel movements. My OB at my last appointment said that some cramping is normal but if it's persistent I will be calling L&amp;D on call. If I'm already this miserable at 24 weeks, I'm frightened. 
38jnco	-30918	1433439803	BabyBumps	96 more days. Can I do this?	Pregnancy just got really hard a week ago with these little loafs of baby love growing so fast in my tummy. I can't wait to have them on the outside and just hold them. Sigh.

I am a teacher and I am used to going on mountain biking, rock climbing and backpacking trips all summer long. I never realized how active I was until I couldn't be. I miss this so much! However, when I feel little babies rolling around in me it reminds me that this is also the best summer of my life. I guess this is why pregnancy is referred to as the "longest shortest time."

3auvqu	-30918	1435083731	BabyBumps	What surprising, scary or odd pregnancy symptoms have you had?	Now in 3rd trimester and having been a regular baby bumper, I'm finding that "uncommon" pregnancy symptoms are actually quite common. I freaked out over most of these at some point because all references don't list them as "normal" pregnancy symptoms. I've had extra appointments to check these symptoms out along the way and everything turned out to be normal. Here are some of mine: Bleeding all of 1st trimester, super swollen labia, lots of watery, clear discharge. Update: I have to add 1 more. I became a vegetarian on accident the second I got pregnant. Meat is gross and stinks. 
3b1rfd	-30918	1435216569	BabyBumps	My OB said it's okay, but I'm wondering if any of you have swam pregnant in cold water, such as a lake or river.	There are not any outdoor swimming pools where I live and I'm tired of the indoor pool. Most lakes and rivers here are on the clean, unpolluted side, but I'm worried about what is too cold. I swam in cold water all the time pre-pregnancy and am pretty tolerant of it. Update: Went swimming in a cold river over the weekend (not frigid, just a bit colder than a swimming pool). It felt so amazing on my muscles! I think the babies loved the experience because they were popping like popcorn in my belly afterward.  Yay for cold water!

3bjjbh	-30918	1435605047	parentsofmultiples	Planned cesarean with twins or no?	I realize I might not have a choice is baby A ends up breech, but so far both are head down (28 weeks here). I'm a little nervous either way being a first time mom. Any stories about how your birth went down vaginal or cesarean? Any regrets? Did plans change mid-labor? Just trying to get some perspective here and do what's safest for babies. Thanks! 
3bw2fo	-30918	1435856199	GestationalDiabetes	What happens when you're diagnosed with GD?	I just failed my 1 hour test (quite miserably) and am supposed to schedule the 3 hour test. I really, really don't want to, because the first test was really hard. It made me shaky and queasy and I didn't even have to fast for it. After I drank it, my twins weren't moving much and it really freaked me out. I feel like ingesting double that sugar bomb, 3 times without eating will be really bad for me and babies. I know that if I refuse the 3 hour I'll be diagnosed with GD. So, whether I fail the 3 hour or get diagnosed, I'm trying to get an idea of what I'm in for. Thanks in advanced ladies! Update: I declined the 3 hour test. My OB is having me track levels at home for a week instead and go from there. 
3bw4nl	-30918	1435857200	BabyBumps	What happens when you're diagnosed with GD?(copied post from r/gestationaldiabetes)	I am posting this on 2 subs to see if I get more responses. I just failed my 1 hour test (quite miserably) and am supposed to schedule the 3 hour test. I really, really don't want to, because the first test was really hard. It made me shaky and queasy and I didn't even have to fast for it. After I drank it, my twins weren't moving much for a couple hours and it really freaked me out. I feel like ingesting double that sugar bomb, 3 times without eating will be really bad for me and babies. I have a healthy diet- lots of fruits and veggies, low-fat everything and this sugar bomb business really bugs me. I know that if I refuse the 3 hour I'll be diagnosed with GD. So, whether I fail the 3 hour or get diagnosed, I'm trying to get an idea of what I'm in for. I have no high-risk factors other than being pregnant with twins. I'm a skinny gal and entered this pregnancy in the best shape of my life. I've stayed fairly active and swam laps 30 minutes/day all pregnancy. If I have to modify my diet, this won't really bother me at all. What I'm worried about are how many extra appointments/monitoring will I have to have? I'm already getting an ultrasound every 2 weeks because it's twins.Update: I declined the 3 hour test. My OB is having me track levels at home for a week instead and go from there.  Thanks in advanced ladies!
3bxmkw	-30918	1435882532	BabyBumps	Any experienced moms with nursing bra advice?	I've got a couple months of pregnancy left, but I'm trying to plan ahead. As far as regular bras go, I usually like more sporty kinds and hate fancy or underwire bras. Pre-pregnancy I was an full A cup and pregnancy has made me a Cish. I tried on a few nursing bras at motherhood maternity and hated them as they were uncomfortable. What brands are comfortable but do the job? Thanks!

3cdt9z	-30918	1436239174	BabyBumps	Happy that I've met a lot of happy new moms randomly in public recently with their happy little babies!	I even had a happy mommy ask to touch my belly at the gym as she was holding her 4 month old (I've been totally cool with this as long as people ask). She was so excited for me and I was equally excited to see her sweet, sweet LO smiling. So why is it that every older-woman gives me the "advice" that my life is over and that it's all going to be hell and etc? Makes no sense! Anyone else notice this? I guess I just extra appreciate all the positive vibes from new moms! 
3cgcq3	-30918	1436293212	BabyBumps	Another job interview- A phone one. Bring up pregnancy with closeish due date? Yay or nay?	I was really surprised to get this interview, as I applied months ago and assumed it had been filled. I REALLY, REALLY want this job. The problem is that on my application I said I could start ASAP, but that was back in March. Although I'd be free to start a new job just a few weeks after delivering (my husband has 12 weeks paternity leave), I know this organization would possibly want me to fly somewhere for training, and I'm on a travel restriction due to 3rd tri with twins. The timing stinks. This is just an initial HR interview with probably a few more steps to go. When do I bring up the due date issue? Edit: After training it is a fully work-from-home position, which is one reason why I really want this job. Training is in a city where I have lots of relatives and husband could accompany me with babies to make it more possible. 
3cgea8	-30918	1436293839	exmormon	How do you think your life would be different if you had been allowed to think for yourself from day 1?	I often wonder this. I think I would have pursued a career in science had I been exposed to real science curriculum growing up. As an adult I've become more and more fascinated with all things science. I've learned that I don't need to believe in magic to think the earth and life is amazing. I grew up in a TBM town and the word "evolution" was only whispered in dark, dark corners.

3d1acm	-30918	1436725148	BabyBumps	Feeling anxious. Other third-trimester moms out there? Especially if you're having twins-How are you feeling?	30 weeks with twins here. I was doing great up until 3 days ago when I started to get a pain in my lower back that makes it really hard to walk. The support belt I bought only seems to make it worse. My hands also started going numb in the middle of the night, which is weird because I'm not the slightest bit swollen. I'm all belly. I've also been having a lot of anxiety about how far I'll make it and really hoping I'm not completely bed bound by the end. My baby shower is in 4 weeks and hoping I can still walk by then. I'm also having anxiety about out-of-town visitors constantly asking me "when will the babies come?" As if I can predict that this early, and if they come too early they will be in the NICU anyway. Plus, I really don't want anyone visiting until I'm good and ready. Gifts are arriving from out-of-towners, which is great, but it seems to really put the pressure on- hoping everything goes smoothly with both babies. They have consistently measured well and growing at the same pace. Their outlook is good, but I'm still nervous about cutting tags and opening boxes. 
3dekex	-30918	1436981852	parentsofmultiples	I've made it to week 30 with twins and REALLY starting to feel it now. Needing encouragement.	I felt so great up until week 29 when my back started hurting, making walking a challenge. Insomnia and kicked in and I get hip pain in the night, even with my snoogle and tempurpedic bed. I have a job interview in 3 days and questioning my ability to get myself there. The great news is that both babies measured large at 3lbs each at my 28 week appointment, growing at the same pace. They are very active and I feel them almost constantly. I will have a scheduled C-section at 38 weeks and I'm really starting to wonder how/if I'll make it that far and how much worse I'm going to feel by then. Strangers are staring at me and making inappropriate comments about me going into labor. I am thin with a huge belly and look equivalent to full term with 1. How did you manage in carrying your multiples into the week 30's? Any advice? Is it normal to feel this pregnant this early?

3ebyra	-30918	1437665065	BabyBumps	Great news today! Twins could make it through the the premie stage.	I was having tons of Braxton hicks 5-8 minutes apart yesterday (Only 31 weeks) along with some cervical pain and pressure so I went in and got checked out. The contractions slowed down and my cervix is still long and closed. Babies likely to hang out a few more weeks :) no restrictions which means sex and swimming are still okay. Cheers to possible future chubby twin babies! And I'm likely to make it to my 34 week baby shower.

My OB saw the results and said it's apparent that I do not have GD. One less headache! yay! 
3emghi	-30918	1437879148	parentsofmultiples	How much time did you take off work after having twins? How do you feel about your decision?	I am a teacher and need to decide quickly if I want to sign a full time or part time contract or take the whole school year off (wouldn't guarantee I get my job back). If I take a contract I'll get 8 weeks leave. Husband can take 12 weeks. Money will be super tight if I don't work at all but it's possible (we would be living check to check which we have never had to do and scares me). Edit: Due date is 9/9 My updated thoughts: Thinking I won't go back full time after just 8 weeks. So it's down to part time or take a year off. Update: I've accepted a .4 position, so I'd be working 2 days a week.  My husband will be taking his FMLA in bits and pieces so he can stay home possibly on days I'm working for the first couple of months and then we plan to find a part time nanny.

3foy76	-30918	1438651249	BabyBumps	33 weeks with twins. Already getting pop in visits and calls from relatives "are you in labor yet?"	Any time I hiccup or cough they assume this is it. I sat on a chair that had a bunch of soap on it that leaked and when I stood up my mom was convinced my water broke. I laughed and told her I would have have noticed if that goo came from me. I'm not expecting showtime for at least a couple more weeks. If it's any sooner the babies will be way to tiny for everyone to hold them and in the NICU so why are they all so antsy already?
3fq183	-30918	1438674095	BabyBumps	Should I switch OB/hospital at 33 weeks? Long story.	I had an NST a couple weeks ago and had a cervix check due to many Braxton hicks. Everything was fine and the on call OB sent me home on "no restrictions." A few nights later I was having several painful Braxton hicks and went in to be checked again and the other doctor told me its because I had had sex within 24 hours and she pretty much chewed me out for having sex as if I was trying to go into labor at 32 weeks. She ordered me a large dose of ibuprofen as a one time thing saying it stops the sperm from ripening my cervix. I thought this was total bullshit but I was in a lot of pain and needed the contractions to stop so I went ahead and took the pill against my better judgement. I've been doing research and not finding solid evidence that sex causes labor. Plus, I've had a lot intercourse this pregnancy with no issues. I'm so annoyed with this one OB that I want to switch groups just in case she happens to be on call when I'm really in labor. I love my regular OB and all the others I've met there. The nurses at nice too. This experience was just so bad that I've been having severe anxiety before all my NSTs, paranoid that doctor will be there. FYI, my own OB said no sex restrictions are necessary. Would you switch or suck it up?

I am starting to get severe anxiety that is affecting my sleep/appetite about how/when the birth is going to go down and about becoming a new mom even though I've suffered through years of fertility treatment and have wanted this for a very long time. Is this just how it is for everyone near the end of pregnancy, or do I need to find some better ways to cope? I have a very supportive spouse and mother in town, but I'm still a bag of nerves right now. Any words of encouragement from those on the other side? Thank  you!

A 50ish year old lady was entering as I was leaving and held the door for me. I thought that was nice but then she said to her friend, "Wide load coming through." Wish I had punched her in her stupid face. What a rude thing to say! Not only that, but I am seriously a stick with a bump. No swelling. I am very fortunate in this way, but what an insult!

My first check my OB said I was "thinning" and my last check she said I was 50% effaced. However, the ultrasound tech said my cervix was 47mm after the fact, and that sounds pretty long to me. Is effacement different than length? If not, how is all this variation possible?

2a3bmm	-30922	1404773577	weddingplanning	Can I have two maids of honor? (mini rant)	My mom says no but I have been hearing of more and more brides that have decided to have two. There are a few reasons why I want to have two maids of honor. My very best friend, since I was just a baby, has to be my maid of honor. We promised each other when we were little and although we don't talk often, we are still very close. However, she is not the most reliable. She kind of proved this when she went out drinking the night before we were going wedding dress shopping. She had to go the hospital because she ended up tearing a ligament. Luckily my first appointment ran short because I had to pick her up from the hospital. She did come with me on crutches to the other appointments and I am grateful for that. But if it were her, I would never have gone out drinking the night before.The other girl I want to ask would technically be a matron of honor as she will be married by the time my wedding comes around. We have been very close friends since high school and have become even closer in the last year. We talk and see each other often and are at similar points in our lives. She is actually flying out with just her groom to get married in November. I figure this would lessen the planning/monetary burden on just one bridesmaid. And they do know each other but they are just acquaintances, I don't want to force them to work together. I have already asked my more unreliable friend to be maid of honor and she does know I am considering a second. She said it doesn't bother her. I just don't know what to do.

Really it was the first theme I could think of.  However, it seems like everyone and their mother is choosing this theme, including a friend that is getting married a few months after me. I haven't purchased anything for the burlap thing and I'm not getting married until June 2015. First of all, do I even have time to change my mind? Second, what other themes are there?!

Any ideas? Also is there an inexpensive way to clean it myself?

2bs1cc	-30924	1406382526	Awesomenauts	Help with Playing/Fighting Sentry	I've discovered a problem recently in that I can't play as, nor effectively fight against, Sentry. When playing as him, I feel slow, weak, and inefficient with my black holes and teleports. When I fight against him it always feels like they are always pushing, always have a black hole, and never die. At first I thought it was because I'm in League 2 and everyone was just better, but I can play as or kill other Nauts just fine, just not Sentry. It's come to where I simply don't like him; he's the only Naut I won't stick with when I random. However, I want this to change. What can I do to be better with (and against) Sentry?TL;DR: My goal is to get better at playing Sentry, so that I'll better understand his weaknesses and thereby make him easier to fight against. How do I do this?

I liked it, but didn't want to take the time to remake all of my Cockatrice decks in it, so yesterday I wrote a Python script to do it for me. I thought people here might be interested in it. It will either convert a single file that you type in or scan the directory it's in and all subdirectories for .cod files convert all of them. It'll place the .dck files in a "Converted Decks" folder, retaining the hierarchy of your decks if you have one.If you don't want to fiddle with anything like required libraries or Python versions, download the standalone .7z file, extract the contents, place your Cockatrice decks inside the extracted folder, and run "c2x.exe".Alternatively, if you are cynical and want to see the script itself, that link is below the standalone.

Don't know what I was doing on omegle back in November of 2010 but it amazes me that all the disconnects and reconnects for hours on end, between thousands of people, put me into a conversation that just clicked. And it's been clicking since.&gt;&gt; fast-forward to Oct 2011We decided we wanted to meet each other and found the perfect time and place to do so. She worked very hard at getting into the disney college program so what better way to meet a person than at disney world? The experience of her opening up the hotel door and seeing her smiling face...words cannot do justice for what that did to me. It is something I will never forget. We spent a week doing all the parks in Orlando having the times of our lives, just us. Since then I've been back down to florida for a second time where she got to meet my family. I've never had a girlfriend before her and honestly don't ever want anyone else. This girl makes me happy everyday, gives me security, comfort, and confidence in myself. She's the first person I talk to when I wake up and the last person I talk to before we have to say good night. I share everything with her.It's amazing what months online and only days in person can create between two people.I can't wait until the next time we meet.It's getting quite late! Just had to tell everyone how great meeting someone online can be! :)  [and the obligatory pictures!](http://imgur.com/a/kH8OR#85cIf)

My first night in them was hell, waking up every hour or so to readjust my body so that half of my waist could breathe a little. My parents (the only people who saw me in them) told me I should send them back when they first saw me wearing them and I probably should have listened to them. Instead I said Oh I've been reading all of these online forums saying that I should size them down at least half an inch because they'll stretch out. I did do my research. Everyone who apparently owns ub221s on this forum said they'll at least stretch out about half an inch (on other forums they said they stretch out a ton (an inch plus I can only assume)). I haven't remeasured them because there's no point, they hurt and my waist is turning black and blue. Unless I magically gained a few inches in the past few days I can't see how I messed up the sizing this bad to induce this amount of pain.I do appreciate Jay and Kevin at blue owl trying to help me size them out. Its just that when I received them based upon what I read online they should be a pain to button up and are painful to wear for about the first week (was this a joke and to what extent?). I'm not sending it back because the tags are all messed up now and the denim behind the knees  are already permanently bunched up.Nothing against Unbranded or Blue Owl. I dicked up and now I'm giving up, fortunately I'm only out about a hundred bucks. I'm literally a sore loser and I'm okay with that. Now I'm just trying to get my slightly smaller brother to wear them; who knows, may end up being a perfect fit for him?

I would rather have it integrated into the site than just have a user download a file and run it. Also, I am planning to write the game in Java, but if python or even something like javascript would work better, I am also open to those options. JUst asking for a little help getting started. Thanks!

I just finished my first year majoring in comp sci at university and I wanted to do a project over the summer to try and improve on what I've learned and to learn new things. So I chose to try and build a text adventure and put it onto a website (similar to http://candies.aniwey.net/, but obviously the game will be very different). Anyways, I was wondering what a good way to get started with this. I already have a good outline for the story and I'm able to translate it to code or at least learn how to on the way, but I think I need the most help with getting it onto a website. I can host my own, but I was wondering which language to use and how exactly to get it on the website. Ideally, I want to use Java because that is what my CS classes next year will be in, but I'm open to anything. Thanks!

1i004n	-30932	1373452653	CODZombies	So I have a problem with the easter eggs and maybe you guys can help.	BURIED SPOILERS. So since the ending easter egg came out where all four people have to do all of the same side easter eggs, my group has been trying to get it, naturally. Right now, however, we seem to have run into a wall. Of the four of us, two of us have all three richtofen easter eggs done, one of us is missing one the tranzit easter egg, and the last one is missing only the buried easter egg. Normally this wouldn't be a problem. We were all set on having to do buried and tranzit again and it wouldn't be bad... BUT. the problem is we can't. When we tried tranzit, the tower was already lit up and we couldn't do richtofens easter egg. In buried, the parts to the guillotine simply weren't there. So we tried each of us being host and starting a game. It's been the same every time. So I'm asking for advice or help on how to do this. The way I see it, there's only two options. 1 we get our teammates to go find other people to do their respective easter eggs or 2 we do the maxis side as we can still do those.What are your thoughts?

So I recently felt like playing runescape after a couple of years off and I went to log on only to find out that I had been permanently banned recently (during the time I hadn't been playing). According to Jagex, the nature of the ban did not allow an appeal or for me to view the evidence of the ban so I was stuck. I've had customer service related problems with Jagex in the past so I do not want to start a new character or give the company any more money. Is there any game that can give me a similar experience as runescape? Since it was the only mmo I've ever played I'm not too familiar with the other ones. Thanks

I am a junior at a good state school (although technically a senior due to taking extra classes and having high school credit) looking to graduate either next year or maybe the year after. I'm enjoying both of my majors a lot and have a ~3.5 gpa. In addition I will be getting a math minor since I have already taken a ton of math classes for my majors.Right now I think I'm leaning more towards a software engineering internship, but if I could incorporate my physics education that would be great too. I have looked at my university's career services, but just wanted to see if reddit could help my search as well. Midwest internships would be preferable, but anywhere in the US is fine. Even if you could point me in the right direction to look or recommend certain positions that would be great. Thanks.

I played a bit yesterday and it seemed like there was a lot of stuff I didn't know about, but I might just be forgetting certain aspects. Anyways thanks for whatever help you guys can give me

138m2p	-30935	1352987724	leagueoflegends	League of Legends Voice Chat Client	Hi guys and gals,I'm posting here for two reasons:1) To get an idea for the demand for a League of Legends voice chat client.2) To get some feedback on the client I've made and plan to, in the near future, publicly release.Client Setup: Consists of the client itself and requires an installation of the latest TeamSpeak 3 client.So here's how the client works for a user:- You start the client and it runs in the system tray.If it's your first time playing you will specify what region you're playing on (can be changed later if you change server).- You start the Lolclient, login and enter a queue.- When you hit champion select, the TeamSpeak 3 client automatically launches and joins you into a private channel with the other summoners on your team running the same client. For anyone not running the client there will be a URL available that players can copy into chat that will launch TeamSpeak and join them into the private channel. After 3 minutes from champion select the channel will be locked permanently from anyone joining.And that's it.Any feedback is greatly appreciated as long as it's constructive and please show me your support if it's something you could see yourself using.Thanks.

13bkrr	-30935	1353103554	leagueoflegends	League of Legends Voice Client	Hi,Recently I developed a voice client for league of legends that will recognize when you enter champion select and launch TeamSpeak 3 joining you into a private channel with other players on your team.To use the client, you launch it, select what region you're connecting through (ex. EUW) and then launch the league client - the whole process is automated after this point.I am working on adding a hotkey mute feature so you can mute anyone you don't want to hear.I plan to release this soon, publicly, but want to get an idea for the demand before I invest in hosting etc.So please show me your support if you would want to use it, constructively criticise the idea or even suggest nice-to-have features.Thanks.

1d1hir	-30935	1366842159	leagueoflegends	League of Legends Bug Reporting - EUW Forum just for placebo?	I don't know how it is for NA but on EUW the bug reporting forum seems completely neglected by Riot.There is sticky set up to list currently known bugs in which they state they will maintain and keep a close watch on the new reports. Despite the 10s of new bugs (some of which are quite serious such as gold exploits) that get reported there is no word or even acknowledgement from Riot.Sure there's a lot of unhelpful "my gAIm fRozE rIOT! FIX Eet &gt;:(" with no information on how to reproduce the crash but at the same time there are a lot of very detailed reports that come in weekly.As things are I do not know what Riot's stance is and I'm looking for some transparency. Are they just ignoring us? If not, why not post, not daily, but maybe a weekly update onto which bugs are being looked into and what bugs have been acknowledged to be looked into?It's frustrating, as I'm sure others will agree, because we want to help highlight these issues to be fixed to ensure quality of League of Legends games but it just feels like our posts are being ignored.P.S. This same issue came up around a year ago and Riot assured us that there would be a lot more communication (you can read it on the stickies). There was... for a few weeks.

1dnf1g	-30935	1367623979	leagueoflegends	ARAM Suggestion: Champion Value Weightings	Too often are ARAMs unbalanced due to the champions on one team being much more suited to the aspect of the game mode and the randomness of the champions rolled.What I would suggest is that there is a hidden ARAM value for each champion that would hold how valuable that champion is in the game.For instance, Nidalee would have a high value because she is amazing at poking and Fiddlesticks would have a high because he can dominate in quarters combat. Low value champions might be Ashe, Tryndamere, Sivir etc.When it comes to the gamemode randomly choosing each team champions it tries to keep the total of these values relatively close for each team resulting in a much more balanced and interesting game.Just an idea though - what do you guys think?

It is counter-intuitive and unhelpful to their player base to not make these issues clearly and immediately visible.

So addictive!It broke the player record today and I can only see the server continuing to do so.With this in mind I think it would awesome to keep track of the expansion of the player created world over the lifetime of the server by generating an map image from above with all player chunks patched together. The image should be saved off each day and archived so it will be possible to track how the world has grown.To get the best result it would need to be implemented as soon as.Is this something anyone else would like to see too?
212qnc	-30935	1395497396	MCNext	Griefer mechanic problem	The griefer mechanic needs to give a warning to players when they are tampering with blocks that could render them a "griefer".What has highlighted this for me especially is the below:--------------Today I invited a friend to play for the first time on MCNext, gave them full diamond gear, food etc and let them go to get started on establishing their player home.Within 10 minutes I see he has been declared a griefer, is killed and loses all the items I gave him.I talk to him to find out what happened and he's completely bewildered as to what happened and angry that he lost all the items without even knowingly having done anything wrong.My friend told me that he started digging down and forward to reach the lower levels of the world where there are more ores before being *randomly teleported* to a player house and killed.It has been a terrible first experience on the server for him and left him dissatisfied and not wanting to log back on.--------------The current implementation needs work to make players and especially new players aware that there are consequences of manipulating the terrain around other player's houses and alert them if they are in the running to commit a potential griefing offense.

The next person should reply to me,&lt;their_player_name&gt; : Linked!and then place a sign in their plot referencing the name i gave salad_pie.*(although I have no one to link currently, I will update this post with the name of the last person to have joined the chain as well as update the sign in my plot with their name accordingly)*REMEMBER: REPLY TO THE LAST PERSON WHO REPLIED IN THE COMMENT CHAIN, DO NOT CREATE A NEW COMMENT AGAINST THE OP.
27a402	-30935	1401876951	leagueoflegends	Honor System Suggestion	Simplify the honor system to one option, similar to a like button: "I would like to play with this player again".Incorporate the use of this data into the matchmaking system to prefer players you have "liked" or have "liked" you when matching games together (does not matter what team side they appear on). Aside from good spirited players getting more frequently matched with good spirited players and games being generally friendlier and therefore more enjoyable, you will also be able to see your liked rating on your summoner profile and visibly build up a good reputation that could be rewarded for reaching certain milestones.(This could be expanded to have a button "I would not like to play with this player again" with a hidden value attached to your profile but I'm not sure if that would be a good thing).Thoughts?

29cur5	-30935	1403999418	RocketLeague	Initial Impressions	Today was my first day playing the game (and discovering it!).Here's the things I liked and things I didn't:**Liked**+ Gameplay is quick and I see a lot of potential for coordinated cooperation that can result in some awesome matches.+ Loved the replay cut when you score a goal.+ The graphics are great, very polished and the game has a nice arcade feel about it which it should given games are short and the tone of the games I've played in is that it's all for a bit a laugh - I don't mind losing so much because I will probably have had a great time.+ The customisation implementation looks really cool prospectively, I see a lot of potential here. Kind of like the TF2 reward system but with a lot more possibilities for customisation and therefore personalisation.+ Menus are good, responsive and descriptive.**Disliked**- I started the game by joining a "easy" bot game. Those bots are NOT easy - they destroyed me over and over. I know how to play now but I still reckon I'd do no better against those bots. Make some actual easy bots for true beginners!- Some games people were using voice chat and it seemed to lag the gameplay when their mics were broadcasting. Plus the voice quality was always poor to the point it was hard to make out anything people were saying.- **Retracted after discovering controls and settings options** - Visibility of the ball and indicators of where it currently is were frustratingly bad.  I feel the indicators provided are good but they aren't enough. Players shouldn't be limited for planning their attack on the ball because of not knowing exactly where the ball is. Maybe give the option to zoom further out from the vehicle/unlock the camera so it can rotate around the car up and down/add a mini map.- There was quite a lot of lag in some games that effected movement really badly, but I guess this is just a technical issue not a problem with the game. Maybe its already in the road map but having servers dedicated to and in different regions would be cool.- Assists don't seem to get recognised and count as assists - a bug I guess?Overall I love the game and will certainly keep playing. I look forward to seeing where it's going.*IGN Salad Pie if you see me in game say hi!*

Handing in a bounty gives you a ton of experience that applies the full amount to all your equipped gear over.Also (for the new players), make sure you spend your:Vanguard/Crucible marks before hitting the cap at 200 as any you earn before this will count toward your weekly limit but you won't get the marks. If you are maxed out with the best armor/weapons you want you can just buy some gear to break down into ascendant materials.Glimmer before hitting the cap at 25000 as any you earn beyond this will be lost. Some players buy heavy/special ammo synthesis if they have max glimmer as they can come in handy when playing the end-game raid content.

You'll find it helps to use the specific type of damage against enemies with shields:  * Arc (light blue) against the Fallen  * Solar (orange) against the Cabal  * Void (purple) against the VexFeel free to contribute anything you think would have helped you and I'll add any good information to this post.

I haven't tried too many things yet to get it into solution, but I was wondering if anybody has any ideas. Could I acidify/basify the solution, or would a little heat help? And if not, could I just dilute it enough to get it all into solution?Edit: I mixed it with 5 ml everclear and it all went into solution fine. Thanks for the advice.

This seems to have been ages and ages ago, but possibly the time just hasn't come yet.Anyways, I remember this guy was a respected member of our community here, and said he had information of vital importance relating to either a market or an event that was allegedly about to occur. For security reasons, he was unable to post his findings at the time, but he encrypted his message using some one way hashing algorithm and asked people to post it as a comment, and that in x amount of time, he would post his findings and everybody could verify their authenticity by hashing it themselves. Did he ever post those findings? Has it not been long enough yet? Does anybody else remember what I'm talking about?

2itx1p	-30954	1412917726	DarkNetMarkets	Need help ASAP! I signed for a package and it wasn't my normal mail delivery person.	At just about 4pm today, I heard a knock at the door. "Weird" I thought, because the doorbell works perfectly fine.Anyways, because I was so noided out, I looked through a window on the opposite side of the house before answering. I was really fucking high, but I could swear I saw what looked to be a disguised mail truck sitting on the edge of my driveway.  There was nobody in it, and the back must have been plenty big to fit six or seven officers in there. I'll post some pictures I took at the end of this post. I've been expecting something really big for a while, so although something fishy was obviously going on, I decided I'd just crack the window a bit and tell this "mailman" to leave whatever he had on the porch. I was firm and unwavering in my approach, and figured if this was a controlled delivery, my whole "plan" would work. Well you guessed it, the bloody cunt told me I needed to sign. Now you've got to understand, what was in the package this man was holding, was worth thousands of dollars. This is my trap house, and if need be, there are some real animals in the upstairs and downstairs, and in the kitchen and garage that would make sure I didn't get hauled off today. So I opened the fucking door and signed. He looked anxiously over his shoulder and I could see he had some kind of walkie talkie in his pocket, but I was set. The bastard scurried away and I didn't even get to see if people that were potentially hiding out of my line of sight (in front of the garage for instance) got into the back of his truck before he left the house. Now, (t)he(y) may have recognized that I had more or less an army to back me up, and it wasn't the time, or possibly, they needed to get out before I realized there were NO FUCKING DRUGS IN MY PACK.So either this was an operation to get me to sign as some kind of evidence, or I just got ripped off in the bravest fucking way possible. You tell me what my best course of action is though. [This](http://i.imgur.com/9DVjsUS.jpg ) is a picture of the truck. [This](http://i.imgur.com/HcbG7DZ.jpg) is my package, and I guess just because, [this](http://i.imgur.com/pGe8RVN.jpg) is a couple of the homies that also think something weird is going on..../s

2uobzq	-30954	1422995938	opiates	Getting the most out of dilaudid (with ketamine)	I've been shooting a lot of dilaudid lately. The rush is incredible, but the nearly nonexistent high afterwards leaves me feeling like I just got my dick teased with no hope of busting a nut.I experimented with mixing some dope into my shot. That was nice, but my scale broke a couple weeks back and I was really nervous about overdoing it since I was eyeballing my smack. With a scale, I believe this would be a great way to get the most out of that precious dilly.Last night I prepped a fat shot of ketamine. I wanted to k-hole, but again because of the lack of a scale, I was nervous. I know I would have had to have done a hell of a lot more to reach an anaesthetic dose, but I tend to vomit when I do K, so still, nervous. I didn't want to go full K-hole and have to deal with throwing up. So I IM'd my K, and about 7 minutes later I realized I hadn't done nearly enough.  So with my robot legs on, I walked over to my table and started prepping another shot. I'm typing on my phone so I'll spare you the details, but this shot was beautiful and put me right where I wanted to be. Anywho, this brings me to the current time. I just got back from the dentist, and was anxious to do some dilaudid. When I got my spoon out, I realized that in the haze of my K trip last night, I had left a lot of kitty on my spoon. Instead of cleaning it, I decided to leave it there for my shot. I poured out 6mg of dilaudid, put 90units of water, mixed that bitch up right, and drew up through a cotton. I always double filter my dilaudid, so I cleaned the spoon, emptied the barrel back into it, cleaned the rig out a bit with some water, and drew it back up through another cotton. I got situated watching some Gumball, tied off, registered, let the tourniquet off, and pushed the plunger down. Now I've never IV'd ketamine, so I was kinda nervous. But the rush hit immediately and was just as great as always. I started the timer on my watch to see if the k affected the duration of the high at all, and laid back. The high was not letting up after what felt like a significant amount of time, and I looked down and realized the rushing sensation was just starting to leave at about 7 minutes. This is more than twice as long as it usually lasts for me. And as I type this sentence, it still feels like the dilaudid is keeping me warm. It's been about 30 minutes since the shot.  I usually feel a dill shot for around 30 minutes, but that's about the very tail end of the high, and its barely noticeable by then. Right now I feel warm and comfortable and how I usually do at like t+7-8 minutes. Maybe it's just cuz I've never IV'd K, but this is so great I had to share.My dream opiate is one with the rush of dilaudid and the duration of oxy, so anything that extends the dilaudid high is fucking primo in my book.I'd estimate there was about 25-35mg of k in my shot. Much love.

He replied very promptly (&lt;12hrs) to tell me that he would indeed make me the listing, but that he would need some time to gather a few extra pills for me. I received another message within the day stating that he had gotten the pills and made the listing for me. His highest listing was for 10 pills, and I was hopeful that I would get a price break for asking for 13, but I didn't. I don't take any points off for this, however, because the cheapest 4mg dilaudid I saw on any other market was from WALLSTREETx2, and it was $13 each, and he would not do business with me because I hadn't made any prior purchases from him. $10 per pill was still an excellent deal and I was very happy for it. I made my order, and it was marked shipped, again, in less than 12 hours. I paid for priority shipping, but the vendor accidentally sent it first class instead. ~~I docked one point for this, even though~~ I normally would have docked a point for this, because I didn't get something that I paid for. However, I feel that it was a genuine mistake by the vendor, and with the difference between the price of priority and first class, I still ended up getting my dilaudid for almost 20% cheaper than the next closest vendor that I could find. The vendor also contacted me before I finalized to let me know that if the pack hadn't arrived within 7 days, he would send a full reship. This is a truly excellent display of vending capability and competence as a businessman, so I gave the vendor one extra point. Not many vendors go so far above and beyond to satisfy. My pack took 5 days to show up in my box, including a weekend, and this was during the blizzards when I had read that mail was moving very slowly.The stealth was very good. Even in a first class envelope, I could not feel the pills even a little bit. Both mine and his [drop] address were printed on, and the envelope was free from any stray markings or damages. Without giving too much detail, there was no decoy inside of the envelope, but the pills were very well protected and were also in a heat-sealed mylar ziploc. All pills arrived intact. For a relatively new vendor, I was beyond pleased with the stealth. It would not have passed an inspection had it been opened, but the professional-looking envelope left no reason for extra scrutiny. As an extra detail, which is why I gave him a 9 instead of an 8 on stealth, the return address on the envelope made it so that, if for some reason the pack was x-rayed and the mylar was detected on the x-ray, there would be no real reason for it to be opened. Finally, after I finalized, the vendor sent me a very detailed description of what the stealth should have been, and asked me if the pack I received matched precisely, so as to ensure that it had not been tampered with, and his stealth methods were still sufficient. I started this review with intentions of being very fair in my grading, and absolutely not going above a 10, but this vendor has apparently started his business with intentions of being very helpful, and absolutely having impeccable customer service practices. So here I also added an extra point.I'm sure this vendor be making quite the name for himself in the near future. I recommend him 100%.    
33fe6h	-30954	1429667930	Animals	I have a turtle	I have a red slider turtle, and have had her since she was just a baby. She is maybe 5 years old now, and I have become incapable of letting her have a good life. She is too big for her tank and I no longer have the money to put her in a bigger tank. I have tried many times to give her to somebody more capable, but they have all been fruitless. I am now getting desperate, and I wonder if I could let her go in the wild. There are large, lake-like ponds near me that could support her, but my question is, would she be able to survive?
33jtn6	-30954	1429755925	opiates	Something is wrong. Please advise. (IV Suboxone. Not your typical question)	This is going to be shortish. I'm on mobile. Please read this, I'm concerned for my health. I've been clean from heroin for ~96 hours. The whole time, all I used was a handful of lope and maybe 4mg of bupe to curb the worst of w/d. I was just having some really intense cravings and some minor w/d. After I let it pass, it came back 15 minutes later in force. I decided that to sate my needle fetish, curb my desire, and hopefully enable me to sleep, I would shoot some Suboxone. I know you're not supposed to do this, but fuck me I did it. I injected probably .75mg of a sublingual film. Filtered once through a cotton. I didn't feel anything for maybe 2 minutes, until I sat down for dinner and started to feel weird. I felt like I was going to have diarrhea, or throw up, but I did neither. My pupils didn't pin or dilate, but my face became very flushed and my eyes became semi-bloodshot. I quickly ate and then laid down, and on my way to bed, my kidneys started to hurt incredibly bad and I started feeling my airways close up. I know I'm not allergic to anything, because I've successfully taken subs dozens of times, but the pain in my kidneys is really what worries me. My heart rate didn't increase much, but my blood pressure did quite significantly. I decided if my air constriction became any worse that I would call for paramedics, but it settled down and my kidney pain eased. My lungs still feel sluggish and heavy, and I have a slight headache. Blood pressure is back to normal, but I don't feel any more well than I did before the shot. I feel safe enough now to just let this pass, but I'm not a medical professional and my quick Google search didn't return anything helpful. I'm less frightened than I was when I began typing this post, but I would really, really appreciate information about what the fuck made that happen to me, and if there are any signs I need to watch for that would necessitate medical attention. Thank you for reading.For clarification, have you ever woken up having to piss so fucking bad, that it actually hurt to pee, and your kidneys hurt afterward? Kinda like they were either imploding or just being mangled completely? That's how the pain was. But much worse. Nearly debilitating. My poor fucking kidneys have been through so much. I really hope this isn't as serious as they tried to make it seem it is. Because they were not happy.

I put the order in maybe 17-18 days ago, and was unable to log on to contact the vendor for quite a while. I hadn't even checked Reddit in a few days, so when I went to extend the autofinalization, I was pretty fucking bummed to see that BB was down.

At the end of it, they tried to stick me with a $300 dollar bill even though i have insurance that i know covers this. After trying to discuss this with them for an hour, they continually insisted that my insurance isn't covering this out of nowhere.I ended the conversation and called the insurance company. They verified that this is false and that i only pay my usual copay. Was this doctors office trying to pull a fast one on me?Edit: Something i left out, during the conversation of copay, the insurance receptionist offered me something where she can make my copay $35, put in a false claim in her books, and she wont report it to the insurance.

2hk1pu	-30962	1411761044	NHLHUT	My advice against buying packs	After watching many YouTube pack opening videos, logic screams that packs are not worth it. In most of these videos which dont pull a Crosby/Ovi/etc, the player loses money or barely breaks even on the packs price even when there is a decent pull.Also, there is 690 NHL players that you can pull. If we assume that every team has an average of about 3 players with a price above 20K, then we are only looking at 90 players you can make a profit on. 90 players out of 690 are not good odds. And the odds get even worse with elite superstars(Crosby, Ovi).Example of the current 35K Mega Pack:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yUVGGwhLuI

2ljpwk	-30962	1415332617	EA_NHL	Tips to all OTP forward's from the defense	Here are a few tips to help all the forwards in OTP from a defenseman.1) Forwards, let the defense deal with dishing the puck out from the defensive zone. Alot of time i have forwards coming back to grab the puck behind the net and try to go coast to coast. 99% of the time you wont beat 2 forecheckers and it will result in a turnover in the defensive zone. Honestly, one of the worst things you can do.2) Stop trying to beat defenders 1-on-1 unless its a 1 on 1 situation. Forwards come into the zone too much trying to beat the D with a 1 on 1 deke. Sometimes it works, but most times it gets poked away. Use your other forwards. You will beat the defense way more by dishing it out and having more than one offensive threat.3) This is one of the biggest. Honestly, just shoot the puck. Teams alot of times have a tough time scoring cause they are just trying to cross-crease everytime. I can read your gonna go for teh pass everytime and poke it away. Diversify your offensive threats so the D cant read you. Cross-creasing everytime with a collapsing defense wont get it done!

2twopl	-30962	1422406277	EA_NHL	A big issue of defense needs to be addressed	It seems like every division 1 game, the defensive strategy of opponents is protect the net collapsing. it completely clogs up the front of the net putting almost all 5 defenders in the slot and in front of the goalie. Honesty, it's very effective. It protects against cross crease and slot shots. But this defense should have consequences like it does in real life. The goalie should not be able to track every puck with 8 people in front of him. It's a giant screen. Yet, if it doesn't hit a body, it always seems to be a low percentage shot with the goalie making an easy save.

38yupj	-30962	1433723057	NHLHUT	I'm ranked in the top 20 in defensive stats(GAA, shots against). Would anyone be interested in any questions?	Wasnt sure if this is the right place. Thought i could help anyone out with the defensive side of the game. Ive played 480 games(303 wins) and have a GAA of 1.67 (rank 15 overall), 12 shots against per game (8th overall), and half of my team wins are shutouts (13th overall). Would be glad to answer questions to help people elevate their defensive game.Quick Tips:Overall, i have a few main tips to elevate your defensive game. First is breakout/board play. Having a good breakout of your defensive zone often is a great tool. It often frustrates the opponent since they can not hold offensive pressure. Pass D-to-D often as the other defenseman is almost always open and creates a new pass lane. Additionally use the boards to pass to forwards and the other defensemen, it works really well against a sustained forecheck.Secondly, every high level player is always looking for a shot in the slot. Defend opponents forehands heavily as goals rarely come off the backhand unless right in front of the net. Players might try to evade you with a backhand look, but always attack the forehand with a pokecheck. You'll block, deflect, and poke away alot of possible shots like this.A lot of what you do in the offensive zone will effect you defensively. When you lose possession of the puck in the offensive zone, forecheck strategically. If you have a chance for the puck, then go for it. But if the opponent has a clear route for breakout, just skate back with your forward. Do this and you will never let up an odd man rush. And don't go for a hit unless your 99.9% sure you are gonna take the opponent out. 9 times out of 10 the guy will make a quick move and burn you.Edit: I do not play a skill-zone defense

135vlw	-30969	1352864645	asoiaf	[Spoilers All] Any Frey and Bolton Supporters??	Walder Frey just went from a disrespected unvalued house in the Riverlands to becoming ruling it [Technically LF does but Frey does in reality]. Walder gave Robb a chance, he stuck his neck out and allied himself all he asked for was his word in marriage and his men, castle and resources were his. He is risking much considering his Riverun is nearly lost at this point and going up against Tywin is never safe.What does he get in return? The boy king spits in his face and marries a lowly impoverished vassals of Tywin Lannister. Walder who never takes risks just gambled his house and was further spit upon. Once i got past my initial anger at RW, upon further consideration I was not even mad. Robb declared war on Walder's house and in war there are no rules, guest right be damned.Roose Bolton did his job. His liege was captured so he marched and have advice where he could. He took command and was successful in his battles. Robb the fool then marries for honour and loses 4,000 Frey men in an instant. Bolton must have been twitching at the boy's stupidity. Fine he thinks I will give him a chance it can't get any worse right? Wrong he kills  his own Bannerman Karkstark and loses thousands more Northmen. Robb fails to communicate his plans to Edmure and then yells at him for not following his plans. Roose made the right call, betraying Robb with Walder and then going back North. There is no malice when we see him, he neither seems to want or not want Wardenship over the North. He knew he would get killed if he continued association with Robb, so he made peace with the Lannisters and got the hell out. Killing Stark Loyalist soldiers off in his trek North.I cannot fault either of these men. Roose is a pragmatist and Walder was a medieval lord who was slighted. People hoot and holler at the badassery of Tywin when he wiped out the Reynes and Tarbecks, his involvement in RW limited the bloodshed and the conflict which in the end was a good thing.They supported Robb, he had them loyal but his stupidity got him killed.The Riverlands and north could do with new leadership.So are there any Bolton and Frey supporters? IMO House stark needs no revival.

Merlin, as far as Arthur knows, is just a servant who is resourceful. Arthur is going on a possible suicide mission and Merlin refuses. He has every right to do this as he is just the servant, not trained as a knight or warrior. How can Arthur expect Merlin to go on this one? He have been asking Merlin to stay at A Camelot and not risk his life for this battle as he would be only get himself killed. It is also insane because in the same sentence he alludes to all the times Merlin has been brave and saved Arthur's life against amazing odds, even though he was a servant but to call him a coward now is crazy.The writes made a mistake with that one. Enjoyable episode but that line really stuck out for me.Not to mention for all the times he saved Arthur he never got any sort of promotion but he throws a knighthood to Mordrid like it is Halloween candy.

Ned, Robert, Tywin, Hoster and a uncheck of others are gone. The only satisfying revenge moment for Dany will come in the form of Stannis if he an hold on. Peers ally I would have loved t have seen Tywin's reaction to the Targ dragons returned. Does anyone else feel underwhelmed at the prospects in Westeros now? Mace will bend the knee easy enough, Dorne will join her, and the rest will follow. Thoughts?

Hey so, I have a small airlock room that automatically opens and closes after a delay to allow a vent to drain the oxygen from the room before opening the exterior door, and refills it after it closes. The problem is, this bleeds air. I'm not losing any to depressurization, I've watched the air vent room % during the whole process, and it reaches 0% before the door opens, and it waits for the door to close before starting to fill back up. I have two large air tanks that lose 0.5% air every time the air lock is used. I understand that air in a door is destroyed when the door is closed, but one block shouldn't take up 0.5% of my total air capacity. Anyone encounter anything like this?Edit: To clarify, watching my tank levels, the air vent recovers all of the O2 in the room before the door opens. The loss occurs when the room is repressurized, and takes 0.5% more O2 when it fills back up.

So anyways, she told me to come back to the store because her next shift is today from 2:00pm to 6:00pm (EST). Anything I should do, say, remember? Any advice is appreciated, thanks.

After finding this sub and convincing my friend to play it, I want to get back into the game. I'm not really sure how though. My item level is 486 and I want to progress in PvE. Do I just have to grind through LFR or is there a faster and hopefully more fun way to get my item level up to 496 so I can get to Siege of Orgrimmar? Thanks.

25ug0p	-30998	1400391952	teenagers	[OTHER] Feeling pretty sad	Not sure how to tag this but whatever, here goes. A year ago I was talking to a really good friend of mine (she's a girl, I'm a guy) and we were talking about how we'd both never hooked up with anyone. We were best friends all summer long, and I really thought we'd end up together. Then, she started dating one of my closest friends. They've been going out since the beginning of the school year, and seem perfectly happy and in love. Every weekend they go on dates and make out and all that couple shit. Since then, she practically stopped talking to me, and my other friend and I are definitely not as good friends as we used to be. All my other friends seem to have their lives together, getting in relationships, getting their first kisses, doing everything I want to do, and I'm just sitting alone, watching everyone else have perfect lives while I just stay in the exact same place, never meeting anyone and never doing all the things I want. Being alone is terrible, and seeing my best friend in a perfect relationship while I'm still in the exact same place I was a year ago is even worse.

Leading up to the last few seasons, I've always felt at least somewhat upbeat leading into the season. Yes, I've usually ended up disappointed at the end of the season, but I've always had a "better luck next time" mentality. This year, however, I just think everything is going to fall apart. Everything that the team has built since 0-16 might just crumble and we'll be right back to where we started when Swartz had his first year. The whole Suh drama has me in this slump as well. I'm also not a fan of the Caldwell hire.Do you feel the same? Do you feel optimistic? Why?

e8knu	-31083	1290158368	funny	The difference between stuck up and grammatically correct	I work at two different places where typical smalltalk occurs. I've devised a plan that I've put into action beautifully more than once.Example conversation:&gt;Me: Hi!  &gt;Customer: Hello! How are you?  &gt;Me: Really good, how about yourself?  &gt;Customer: Well.  First of all, there are people out there who want to be grammatically correct in this everyday talking, which is absolutely fine. There are also, however, people in this world who decide that they need to correct the rest of us. Responding with "well" in a condescending tone is grounds for retaliation.Here is how the revised conversation:&gt;Me: Hi!  &gt;Customer: Hello! How are you?  &gt;Me: Really good, how about yourself?  &gt;Customer: Well.  &gt;Me: That's good to hear! Well thank you! Have a well day!  They give me the "wtf, did he really just say that?" look every time. I love it.

fl1db	-31083	1297674997	Rochester	Student here looking for information on apartments in the Brockport/Chili/Hamlin-ish area.	Will be transferring to SUNY Brockport this fall. I've found a few places on Craigslist, but I wanted to hear reviews on specific places. I'm looking for a 1-2 bedroom place and need all the basics plus internet. I'm thinking it would be kind of cool to live in a complex with a gym/pool stuff like that, but not necessary.      I'm 20 and smoke (not cigarettes) and drink on weekends. Looking for a place that would be chill to have a few friends over (no huge parties) as well as be a good place for doing homework/studying during the week.      So far I've really only been looking at Craigslist for apartments too. Is there anywhere else I can look online that may be a valuable resource?Thanks in advance r/Rochester. Stoked to become part of the community this fall.

khus8	-31083	1316195022	DIY	DIY - can you help me with my Dad's push mower?	It is a Briggs &amp; Stratton 550 series ("Poulan Pro"). While mowing his lawn today out was cycling through revving higher and lower the entire time, not large changes but definitely enough to hear and feel. Hit a small rock (half-fist sized) and it cut out completely. When I tried to start it again it started right back up but at a low rpm, slow enough where short grass will turn it off. The blades look fine, I filled the gas tank, and priming it actually seems to hinder it's performance rather than help (while it's running). DIY, my dad is in the hospital and I'm housesitting for him, I need to get this fixed.  Please help :)

The box has terminals on either side and I'm pushing them with a mtx ta7801 class d monoblock. I'm running 4 gauge wire right now (2 gauge I have but not installed... I'm getting 0 gauge when I get a battery in a couple months). ....The problem:I have a couple buddies who have installed systems for friends before so they were trying to help me, but we're confused as to the best way to wire speakers from amp to box? My buddy was trying to bridge them but I just didn't want to continue until we're sure. Is there any advice you can give in the simplest terms possible?

12en80	-31103	1351702731	starcraft	Thank you ASUS ROG for sending me to Shanghai &amp; supporting eSports!	Hello SC2 subreddit! I am making this post because I simply want to publicly thank **ASUS Republic of Gamers** (ROG) for supporting eSports and competitive gaming. I realize there are numerous companies growing this whole scene and making eSports a legitimate activity, and that other brands are doing their part – but I wanted to thank ASUS ROG in particular for a few reasons.ASUS ROG have sponsored (this list may not include everything):* ASUS ROG Summer 2011 (€15000 prize pool, DIMAGA won)* ASUS ROG Stars Invite ($10,000 prize pool, IdrA won)* ASUS ROG Winter 2012 ($20,000 prize pool, Polt won)* ASUS ROG Summer 2012 ($30 000 prize pool, TaeJa won) * ASUS ROG The GD Invitational ($10,000 prize pool, ThorZaIN won)* Personal sponsorships of: NaNiwa, SaSe, and elfittaja (in the past/currently)* They currently sponsor/support The GD StudioThis list probably isn’t even encompassing everything ASUS ROG has given to SC2 and it definitely does not include everything they have given to eSports. Secondly (as you can see by the title), they are actually sending me and numerous other eSports fans to the **Battle.net World Championships** [(BWC)](http://www.battlenet.com.cn/bwc/en/)  in Shanghai, China next month. For those who aren't aware, this is the culmination of the WCS events put on by Blizzard and many of the top StarCraft II players in the world will be there. They selected me and the others through a series of contests they held over the course of October. For someone who has been involved in eSports for a long time (since 2005 as a journalist for CheckSix Gaming, X3O Gaming, &amp; SK Gaming) – I know it is pretty rare for a company to be giving all-expense paid trips to eSports FANS from all around the world. They have no hidden agenda and they honestly just want us fans to ‘experience the trip of a life time’ – and that is exactly what this will be!Not to mention, we may never have had this video clip if ASUS ROG did not support eSports and SC2: [2GD &amp;(versus?) iNcontroL](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfa-QD9DUig)So head over to ASUS’s various Facebook pages and *show them some love* for what they have done and continue to do for eSports and SC2:* http://www.facebook.com/ASUSROG (ASUS ROG Global)* http://www.facebook.com/ausrog (ASUS ROG Australia)* http://www.facebook.com/rognordic (ASUS ROG Nordic)Thanks guys and maybe I’ll see some of you in Shanghai November 17th-18th. (They didn’t in any way put me up to this… but seeing how players are always shouting out their sponsors for supporting them, I wanted to do my part to thank ASUS ROG for not only sending me to Shanghai for the BWC – but for supporting the game I love: StarCraft II)**TL;DR: ASUS ROG supports SC2 and eSports – big shout out to them!**

I would describe it as a 'flicker' in the connection that happens every 3-5 minutes while online.It APPEARS to happen only when I try and do something within my browser (load a new page), it also happens while on Skype (more frequently on Skype, maybe it drops when more information is being sent across the wifi), etc. For instance, it has happened twice (I've been watching the wireless internet access icon down in my taskbar) since I started typing this message.What I see on my end is, the 5 'lit up bars' in the taskbar icon suddenly go grey, a little yellow circle appears, it 're-finds' my wireless network, and I'm back online.Note: This does not happen on my other computers/devices within my house. All other networked devices hold their connection constantly with no issue. Nothing happens on my modem/routers end (the lights don't change or anything). -- I have a different computer beside me (a laptop, also on wireless) that does NOT drop connection when my desktop PC does.The issue appears to be **isolated to this computer only.****I figure that:**- Somehow a software setting for my wireless adapter got changed on my computer- Somehow a setting within my router got changed and now it's not cooperating with my desktop PC- I've changed the antenna on my wireless network adapter (it detaches on the back), and the disconnecting continues. Maybe there's a problem with the network card itself?**Nothing has changed within my computer since this started happening, nothing has changed in regards to my router/modem either. I haven't updated any hardware/software.I've **re-started my router/modem** and the problem persists.But I really have no idea what it is, nor do I have any idea where to begin tackling this issue. But as you can imagine it's extremely frustrating so I would appreciate any help you can give me!**Additional info:**Windows 7 Pro OS 64-bitIntel core i5-3550 @ 3.30 GHz16 GB (8x2 RAM)NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 TiThomson DCM425 Cable ModemD-LINK Extreme N Gigabit Router (DIR-655)**When I go into device manager, it says:**Atheros AR9285 Wireless Network Adapter (it tells me the driver is up to date when I click 'update driver')**When I look at the box for the network card I actually bought:**TP-LINK 150 Mbps Wireless N PCI Express Adapter (Model #: TL-WN781ND)

17myqx	-31103	1359652274	esports	Growing /r/esports, official Twitter account @eSportsReddit	Hello visitors of **/r/eSports**! I recently took on the 'responsibility' of becoming a moderator of this subreddit and with that, I am hoping to grow it's audience. As an eSports journalist/editorial writer, I am a frequent visitor of this page, and a lot of my content gets posted here.Despite the ever-increasing popularity of eSports titles and their respective subreddits (such as /r/leagueoflegends and /r/starcraft), very seldom do those involved in pro-gaming visit this page. There isn't anything wrong with that, but being who someone who writes very general non-game specific eSports content, I feel this is the only place (on reddit) I can promote my work. Unfortunately, I feel (and I'm sure others whom post their work here feel the same way) that the great content being posted here is being overlooked.Of course I encourage everyone to stay subscribed to their game-specific subreddits, but if you're interested in some all-encompassing eSports content and other work that may 'fall between the cracks' - this is the place to be!With that goal in mind, I have created an official **Twitter** account for the page (www.twitter.com/eSportsReddit). This account will automatically tweet (every 30min) any new posts that are made in this subreddit. Hit it with a follow if you're interested in seeing what type of content is posted here. This should help promote the subreddit, and the popularize the content being submitted here.**EDIT:** (Feb 12, 2013)&gt;Yesterday a friend of mine (who is a consistent contributor to this subreddit) made me aware that his comments/posts were no longer appearing in this subreddit. I investigated further (explored the admin panel for the first time, in more detail) and it appears there was a lot of *automated blocking/spam filtering* going on. Although this feature does pick up some legit spam, it was also automatically censoring posts of great people who contribute quality content to this page. If you've posted here in the first and been *auto-blocked*, don't let that stop you from returning to /r/eSports and posting again! I will keep a closer eye on things and make sure no one is inappropriately filtered. Contact @eSportsReddit or message me (/u/hydrolis) if you have any questions/concerns. Cheers!

1edqmg	-31103	1368625101	mcgill	Signing lease for July 1 even though starting Sept 1	Hello everyone!I'm sure this question has been asked before, but I can't seem to find any threads discussing it. So, I will be starting a PhD in September at McGill and I will be needing a place to live for the next 4-5 years close to the university. I'm moderately familiar with the different 'zones' student live in and where I should start looking.Something that I am not 100% clear on though is this 'July 1 moving day.' I've lived in multiple cities in Ontario and students either sign a lease for September 1 or Jan 1 (the major 'moving days')... which always seemed to make more sense to me in regards to students schedules/semesters starting. So, my question: Is it worth finding a place to live/signing a lease 2 months early so that I can secure a 'better' location/apartment? It will suck paying rent on 2 apartments for 2 months but it sounds like it's something I will have to do. Will the selection be drastically depleted come September?Thanks a lot everyone!

2zhw4p	-31103	1426704324	UofT	MA in History: "M.A. Language Requirement" - Looking for more info on this!	Hello everyone! I'm looking for information on the "M.A. Language Requirement" for the MA in History program at UofT.  It is described on the website as follows ( http://history.utoronto.ca/graduate/programs/ ):&gt;The general rule is that M.A. candidates should demonstrate the ability to read French by passing the French language exam while registered in the program. The exam consists of translating passages from French to English and a passing mark is 70%.&gt;Some students may require additional or different language tests: the Russian/East European Area strongly recommends Russian or another Eastern European/Eurasian language (depending on the candidate’s research interests); the Medieval Area suggests M.A. candidates pass the MA Latin exam in addition to the French or German exam. Information about the examinations in languages other than French may be obtained from the appropriate language department.A non-Reddit-using sibling of mine has recently been accepted to this program but has no background in French, or any other languages. Their research area will not be in an area that will require any other specific languages per se... but it appears they will still have to take this French test.**Has anyone in the MA in History program taken this exam? Can anyone shed some light as to what it involves, and how much preparation is required to pass it? When exactly does it need to be completed in the degree?**I would really appreciate info anyone can provide! Cheers,

Subsequently I wrote for X3O Gaming and SK Gaming, covering a variety of competitive titles. I stopped writing in 2010 as I was about to begin graduate school. However, esports has continued to be an interest of mine.**Why do you want to do this?** Currently I am a PhD student in Epidemiology and Biostatistics. In a nutshell, I use mathematical approaches to identify and quantify relationships between particular causes and (health) effects in populations of people. For example, statistical modeling can allow an epidemiologist (health researcher) to quantify the relationship between exposure to pathogens in food (“cause”) and the risk of food poisoning (“effect”). These approaches are used in epidemiology (my field of study) to describe any sort of relationship between a particular cause (exposure to a particular factor) and effect (resulting health outcome due to that exposure). However, these methods could be applied to any sort of topic area or context – and they are (e.g., economics, sociology, psychology). Similarly, the mathematical approaches I am employing as a scientific researcher could be directly applied in the competitive gaming context. **What would you write about?** My goal would be to try and explain how statistics and mathematical modelling can be used in the context of competitive gaming. In the traditional sports world, this is what is described as “sports analytics.” There are a lot of choices players make in any given game (e.g., what champions teams pick in LoL, what guns players buy in CS:GO, what builds players use in SC2), and those particular choices may be statistically associated with particular outcomes. In the world of esports, the outcome of interest is, of course, the probability of success (i.e., winning the match/tournament). *Specifically, I would combine my knowledge of esports with what I am learning through my doctoral degree, to explain how “esport analytics” could help teams and players improve their probability of success.***My question for you is: would you be interested in this type of content?**Thank you for the feedback!- [hydrolis](http://facebook.com/hydrolis)

Or will we be always playing as the 4 new characters from Tranzit no matter what mode we play?
13p0zf	-31148	1353722254	NAEGold	So I guess I will be the guy to mention it...	So Elite sucks, there I said it. Idk if I am an idiot or something but the in-game menu for my Elite friends doesn't show who's online at the top. I have to scroll down and search for who's online and see what's up (also it takes forever to load). I am a little disappointed in this, especially since I rarely get invites from you guys to begin with cuz of my late gaming sessions. I am loving BO2 so far and this is one of my biggest issues. Quick fix would be add everyone but not everyone wants to/has room to be friends.Rant over. 
14omzw	-31148	1355259380	NAEGold	Just a thought	I noticed that since I have the elite ap on my phone (still sucks), one of the good things it does is send me a notification as soon as the message for elite is changed. Yeah I know that when there are clan ops always posted on the sub and I do look at it, but by changing the message to like new op at 1pm or whatever for elite it would instantly notify me on my phone and I'm guessing others too instantly. Not saying we should stop posting it on the sub all together, just a thought I had to make it more instant. Also I don't know how much of a hassle this may be for whoever can do this. TLDR We should have clan op updates be put up on our message board for elite for faster notifications.

1wii8l	-31148	1391042439	NAEGold	[Serious] We need to talk about Clan Wars...	Ok, where do I start? I don't want this to come out the wrong way or anything but I really want what's best for our clan. Currently under our clan we have 56 members in total under elite and this was after THE GRAND PURGE OF 2013. I know people have lives, things come up, we have a busy week, we have a bad week, frustrated at the game, or just personal lives interfere. The problem I am seeing here is that we just simply do not have enough people consistently online when it matters (Clan Wars). This is something I have been noticing every time we have a Clan Wars come up. Currently I am on PS4, so I don't know much to the extent of how many active players there are on PS3. But I do pay close attention to how many people are playing besides us (by us I mean the people on PS4) and I do notice that those numbers usually run between 3-6 people online helping out. The most people I have ever seen playing at the same time across both consoles was like 10-12 and that only lasts maybe an hour. Which is great and awesome when it happens, but the fact of the matter is that's only about 1/5th of our Clan on at once, which to me is kind of sad (and yes I know you guys can do math) and I see scenarios like this occur: -No one on PS4 is online/playing COD or playing other games and a bunch of people on PS3 doing Clan Wars or vice versa-No one at all is playing or only a few 2-3 people are online period attempting to do help in the Clan Wars (which makes it very difficult for us to get ahead in taking nodes)And the 2 biggest issue I see happening is:-There is little to no communication between PS3 and PS4 in the Clan Chat regarding nodes and potential strategies besides the fact that someone targets a node and that's what we go for.-The lack of active players we have during Clan WarsTrust me when we have people online and playing Clan Wars, we fucking DOMINATE but times like when these above scenarios occur are the reason we got placed in Silver last Clan Wars. We are a way better than that and our efforts to last Clan Wars proved that we got what it takes to be Gold or better. But here we are again, another Clan War when it matters, +5 hours in and no is really online. I personally see this as an issue we should be addressing.Ok so now that I provided you guys with the obvious problems our clan is having with Clan Wars let's get to some solutions here:-Possibly add a new rule or some kind of post allowing us to know that you can't play this week or participate in the Clan Wars or something. I remember back in like MW3 days we use to post on the sub even if we were gonna be gone for like a week or something. Lets take this idea and tweak it some how for clan wars and encourage team communication in this fashion.-I almost feel like we should have some kind of method of direct communication for Clan Wars that isn't just the Clan Chat. I know we sometimes do the NAEGOLDROSTER chat every now and then, but really when was the last time that was used or enforced. Since some people mainly "reddit" on their phones, a potential idea could be having one of our mods do a kind of Sticky post for this weeks Clan War where we can have communication about the current clan (setting the comments to sort by new). Or we can just really try and be more active in that Clan Chat. -As for the activity of players portion of this, I do NOT want to say "purge all the guys who do not play as much as us other no lives" because I love you guys. Instead let's try something that will benefit us all. Let us try and get more members both for PS3 and PS4. I don't really "feel" like we are actively recruiting members. I "feel" like it's more of a hey you found us somehow thanks for posting on our sub or hey I know a guy in the clan let me try out. Now I am NOT saying that we should change our recruitment policy but that maybe our fearless leaders should try and be more active in /r/elite, hell even if more of our fearless leaders were active in /r/CODGhosts sporting our clan flair or something, it could lead to an influx of interest in our clan. If I had the authority, I would but I don't. Back on topic here, this would obviously solve our problem of not having enough people to play during Clan Wars, and as long as we look for consistently active new members it will go in our favor. The goal here is to increase our quantity of player while still maintaining the quality of chill people we have in our clan. Also, it will ultimately allows us to further enjoy Clan Wars. (And if our leaders are actively posting on elite and other things I'm sorry for not noticing but I still feel like we need to have a bigger push for this.)I really feel like this will help solve most of our issues that we have during Clan Wars. It really sucks when we just flat out say, well I guess we aren't trying in this Clan Wars. Especially frustrating when we are already playing midway through a node and then someone comes from 0 and takes it before us because we lack the people online. I do hope I made this as informative as possible to help us get in the right direction for Clan Wars. I think I hit every point with this but if there is anything else that you guys think we should do or maybe some suggestions or tweaks we should add, let's please talk about this and get some decision made.Last but not least, Remember the Craiglow! TLDR: Just read it if you care about the clan

He has on glasses.]John: Last year a lost chapter of the Dead Sea Scrolls was unearthed and perhaps the most exciting find [takes of glasses for effect] was information on a thirteenth apostle. Now known as The Overlooked Apostle, his name was Marshall and he was considered by many to be the premiere hypnotist in Galilee. The Book of Marshall, entitled "Power, Profit [Prophet?], and Passion," has shed new light on some of the best loved Bible stories.[Cut to Bob speaking to a group which has gathered. David is standing next to him.]Bob: [with a slight lisp] Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.David: [tugging on Bob's sleeve] Jesus.Bob: Blessed are those who morn for they shall be comforted.David: [repeats tugging] Jesus.Bob: Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the Earth.David: Jesus.Bob: [annoyed] What is it, Marshall?David: Jesus, what if I told you that the meek could inherit something a whole lot better than the Earth? What if I told you that by simply applying my theories of positivity and corrective thinking, that the meek could inherit the will to do whatever they wanted in their wildest dreams?Bob: [humoring him] This is good news, Brother Marshall. We shall discuss it later. Blessed--David: Jesus, you pray a lot, right? How many times, when your at home, alone, do you say to yourself, "I wish I lived in a nice house. I wish I had nice things. I wish I could lose those last twenty pounds.Bob: Marshall, I'm not interested in things material.David: Jesus, I used to be like you. Dirty, smelly, thinking I was the son of God, ha ha.Bob: [to the group] Excuse us one second.[Takes David aside]Bob: Marshall, I *am* the son of God. And I'm not smelly, either.David: Well...[Cut back to John, who has his glasses back on.]John: Marshall was famous for his after prayer seminars which encouraged [takes glasses off for effect] the other Apostles to keep their feet on the ground and keep reaching for the stars.[Cut back to Bob, David, and the group.]Bob: Marshall, go amongst them and feed them from these five loaves and fishes. [hands him a large basket filled] By a miracle of faith, they will all be fed.David: All ye humble of the Earth, step up and claim your fish. Only twelve drachmas a piece.Bob: No Marshall, don't charge them anything. The fish are free; they're a gift from God.David: All right, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. If you act now, okay, the fish and a loaf, six drachmas a piece.Bob: No Marshall. Just give them the fish.David: Okay, Jesus, you got my back up against the wall on this one, but here's the deal-- If you act now, both the fish and a loaf, and I'll throw in this miraculous unleavened bread leavenator. [Holds up a toaster oven made of wicker.][The group applauds.]Bob: No, don't applaud for him. No. No, you're fools.[Cut back to John, who again has his glasses back on.]John: Marshall was also present [glasses off] at the Tomb of Lazarus.[Cut back to Bob, David, and the group.

I'm letting you go.David: Uh, Jesus, you know I'm not only a certified life-changer, but I'm also now a memory expert, what am I thinking of Jesus?Bob: This is good news, Marshall. Please leave your sandals with Sheila on the way out.[Cut back to John.

dtcwz	-31155	1287502202	r4r	[M4F,M,Multi,Party] 31yo Poly Bi-M, Minneapolis	Hi all,The reason for this post is that I am specifically looking for a sexy Halloween party (two actually), one for Friday, Oct. 29th, and one for Saturday, Oct. 30, to attend - one with each of my proper girlfriends.We're poly and involved in the swinger community in the Twin Cities, so it isn't like I never get any action, or am unlikely to find a party seperately, but I notice there are lots of fun and sexy people here on reddit, and I'm always looking to expand my cirlcle of friends of this type.I date very actively, and I'm way into indulging people's kinks.  It seems there's always a post in r/sex wherein someone's afraid that they'll never find someone to indulge their kink -- if that's you, and you can come to or are from the upper midwest, you should drop me a line.As I said, I have two serious girlfriends, so I'm not really looking for a relationship along quite those lines - I'm pretty busy.  But I'm not afraid of commitment, I have plenty of room for friends with benefits or more casual situations.You can feel free to check out my ok cupid profile -- http://www.okcupid.com/profile/homeboyposse -- if you want to see some pictures or learn more about me.So if you're bored, looking for something fun to do, and up for a little adventure with someone who is very unlikely to find you too freaky, drop me a PM.Cheers!PP

eowiw	-31155	1292871973	DebatePolitics	Progressive Taxation	Progressive Taxation.Should the wealthy pay more for government than the poor, by way of paying higher tax rates?  On the one hand, Adam Smith and his followers argue that:"The subjects of every state ought to contribute to thesupport of the government, as nearly as possible in proportion totheir respective abilities: that is, in proportion to the revenuewhich they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state.In the observation or neglect of this maxim consists what iscalled the equality or inequality of taxation. "This position can be interepreted to suggest that because the wealthy enjoy more reveune under the protection of the state, they owe more to its maintainence.On the other hand, according to wikipaedia a notable follower of Smith (who later wrote much on the theories of Utilitarianism and Socialism), J.S. Mill, early in his career felt that:"'equality of taxation' meant "equality of sacrifice" and that progressive taxation penalized those who worked harder and saved more and was therefore "a mild form of robbery".The income tax is an example of a progressive tax.  Income above a certain level is taxed at a higher rate than the first dollars an indidual earns, for example, someone earning $10k/yr may pay 25% of their income to this tax while someone earning $50k/year may pay 25% on the first $10k and 30% on the additional $40k.The sales tax is an example of a regressive tax.  Since the poor spend a very large portion of their income (we'll say all) on goods and services, they pay tax (say 6%) on their entire income of 10k.  The wealthy, earning 50k, are able to save/not spend half their income, so they're paying tax (still 6%) on half their income for an effective tax rate of 3%, half that of their poorer countrymen.Who is for progressive taxation, and prefers graduated taxes like income taxes, and who is against it, preferring regressive taxes like the sales tax on consumption?

evlwe	-31155	1294088582	polyamory	Any political/social activists in the audience?	Does anyone else see a need to politicize the polyamory movement?I have a background in electoral politics, and for the longest time, approaching the question of polyamory, I thought that we didn't really have any practical or important political (or legislative, if you prefer, for specificity) goals around which to organize.But thinking extensively about Sex at Dawn in the process of writing my book, it has become clear to me that there is at least one very important goal polyamorists could achieve through government.Monogamy and the currently predominant mode of dating is predicated on a model where men control the resources that are required for women to maximize the likelyhood of her offspring surviving to adulthood.  Under this classical model, women trade their sex for material support.  If, say, you were me and thought everyone should be trying poly, and that poly should enjoy at least an equal station as a reasonable way to try and have relationships, you would want to remove this social condition - where men control the resources women need.  If the social conditions were such that women didn't have to trade exclusive sex rights for the material security of their offspring, then women would enjoy actual sexual freedom.In many ways, I think we're approaching this tipping point naturally, and that the current wave of successful commercialization of polyamory is evidence of this. But, if we were looking for a legislative agenda, I'd propose this one:Adequate material support for children: Including but not limited to medical care for mothers and children, childcare support or even actual compensation for stay at home parents, high quality early childhood education.What else would you put in a polyamorist politician's platform?

Hi guys,So far I'm really enjoying being a moderator for this community.I wanted to seek imput from the community regarding the sidebar for r/sex.  I haven't bounced this off any other mods to any great extent, so I hope I'm not stepping on toes.Summary:Most reddit communities have a short summary of the purpose of the community directly under the community title, for example, r/ask reddit has:•AskReddit is for thought-provoking, inspired questions.•You are able to post self-posts only! (for other types of questions, see "other reddits" below•Please don't post poll-type questions.•If you see spam, report it!•If you think your post has disappeared, do not hesitate to contact one of the mods, we're happy to help.•Please be aware this sub is not a substitute for real legal or medical help.•Soliciting for money is strongly discouraged. For this, please go to /r/AssistanceI think we should have a short and similar statement here.R/sex is a community for civil discussions about all facets of sexuality.  What else should we say to summarize our community here?Links:I'd like to include a couple more links including r/gonewild and probably r/NSFW in our sidebar as places to direct redditors to repost content that doesn't fit well in r/sex.  Any other suggestions for well-read subreddits that should be included?FAQ:I volunteered to work on a FAQ for r/sex.  What topics would you guys like to see included?Decorum:So far, personal attacks are the only thing addressed by the "sexxiquitte".While you may be fired for reading r/sex posts all day at work, technically speaking this is a SFW reddit, and isn't protected by a 'over 18?' page like, say, r/gonewild.  I think this should be noted in the sidebar, in the summary at the top and the notes on decorum at the bottom.In my view, this community isn't the most appropriate place on Reddit to post erotic/pornographic pictures, videos, or stories, unless the purpose of said materials is to foster a discussion.  When such posts are appropriate to this community, I would like to require that they be tagged NSFW or be subject to removal. Anyone have an opinion on this?I'm going to post 4 comments; summary, links, faq, decorum.  Please give me imput in each area under the appropriate comment.Thanks!Edit:Free upvotes for all imput on this question...

fy1tq	-31155	1299356659	sex	Sexxit FAQ: Methodology Proposal	I have developed a list of 100 or so questions I think are frequently asked.  It’s [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/fy1lf/faq_working_list_of_questions/) now.  I expect possibly some duplication can be removed as well if there are questions that are indeed frequently asked that somehow didn’t make the list.  Currently there is room for 10 more discoveries.Once you’ve helped make that list an even 100 questions I want to adopt it as a draft outline and put it at the bottom of the current FAQ.It is arranged under 23 frequently addressed topics, like anal, orgasm, penis, cheating etc.  Suggest additions or combinations of topics. Over a period of two weeks or a month, each day M-F I’d like to post one topic of the proposed frequently asked questions.  You can submit your responses to the question as asked, and/or give feedback as to how the question should be modified.I will compile the results and edit the project, modifying the question and summarizing the main lines of response.  I will work with someone technical about archiving and potentially linking the original threads as well.Thus each day, five or six frequently asked questions would finally be dealt with collectively by sexxit in a way that can be organized.TL;DRI want to start posting about 5 or 6 supposedly frequently asked questions each day, all on the same topic, for as many days as it takes to get through our list of frequently asked questions.  That gives us a chance to collaborate and have group ownership of the replies, and when we say “---→ FAQ”, we will really mean it.  It does mean it will take a month or two (including editing time) to have a fully functional r/sex FAQ.
fymuz	-31155	1299452938	sex	FAQ 1.1. - Is our age difference creepy?	Pick your scenario.Someone is interested in dating someone of a different age.  What's an acceptable age range, what's creepy?Share your rules and stories.Upvotes for participation.Edit 1: Awesome responses!---Don’t date someone under the age of consent in your jurisdiction if you yourself are over the age of consent.There are many people who say that age is just a number and frequently a poor indication of maturity. Many of these people have relationships with larger age differences, and discount the idea that there is anything wrong with their relationships.There are some equations (yielding different results depending on the inputs) that are commonly used to determine if a person is creepy to date or not:1) (Your Age / 2) + 7 = Minimum acceptable age.2) (Your age – 7) X 2 = Maximum acceptable age. A feature of this equation is that your maximum aged partner can date you un-creepily using equation (1) above.3) (Your Age / 2) – 7 = Number of years age difference allowed (in either direction). Somewhat restrictive on the high end compared to (2) above.4) The square root of your age = number of years age difference allowed (in either direction) Very restrictive on both ends compared to the above choices.And it’s generally agreed that a younger person over a certain age (ranging from 18-21, generally, when they’re an adult) hitting on an older person is far less creepy than an older person hitting on a younger (but adult) person.
fymxn	-31155	1299453140	sex	FAQ 1.2. - Should I date outside my 'creepy' age range, why?	Should someone date someone significantly younger or older than them, and what are your reasons?Share your opinions.Upvotes for participation.Edit 1: Awesome responses here too!---If yes, it is essential that the “Campsite Rule” be followed. Simply put, the campsite rule is that one should leave a campsite in better condition than it was in when one arrived. The campsite rule is applicable in any relationship with an unequal power dynamic. Applied here, it means that an older person has a responsibility to make sure that the younger person is treated ethically and is benefiting from the relationship. People who said that yes, people should date outside their creepy range made the following points:1) Age is superficial and being ageist is no better than being closed off to dating on the basis of race, class or political / religious affiliation.2) Women reach their sexual peak around age 35, men reach theirs around age 18, therefore dating outside of the creepy range provides a high degree of sexual compatibility in a case of a younger man dating an older woman.3) Young women are reputed to reach emotional maturity at a younger age; therefore dating outside of the creepy range provides a high degree of emotional compatibility in the case of a younger woman dating an older man.4) Older men and women tend to be more emotionally stable, comfortable in their own skin, and have more life knowledge relative to younger men and women, therefore dating outside of the creepy age range can provide younger men and women a more pleasant and less dramatic relationship than their same age peers.5) Younger men and women have more youthful appearances.People who said that no, people should not date outside their creepy range made the following points:1) There was significant support for the idea that age is a good indicator of maturity. An interesting appendix to this idea was that a younger person dating an older person would experience more personal growth while dating and could become frustrated with lack of personal growth in their partner.2) Relationships between younger people and older people are typified by a power dynamic that is either unhealthy or beneficially mutually exploitative; that is, older people tend to use younger people for sex and younger people tend to use older people for material support.3) It is socially awkward to be seen in public with someone who could be your child or parent but is in fact your date.4) At a certain number of years difference in age, it is inevitable that generational, bodily, and temperamental differences will become a barrier to compatibility.Finally there was a debate about evolutionary psychology and attraction theory, wherein it was claimed that it is natural for older men to date younger women, but not the other way around. This editor took the contrary position - that there is not a clear evolutionary advantage for this configuration. The matter remains controversial.

fz6cq	-31155	1299522960	sex	FAQ 2.1. - Why would anyone want to do anal play? 	Do you like or desire anal play (either giving or receiving)?  Why or why not?Share your opinions.Upvotes for participation!---**Reasons to enjoy receiving anal:*** 1) There are more nerves in the anus than the vagina. * 2) Greater ease of orgasm during anal vs. vaginal sex. * 3) Feeling of being dominated/easy to focus on receiving. * 4) Men like it as an adjunct to role-playing gender play. * 5) Partner’s enthusiasm for it is sexy.**Reasons to enjoy giving anal:*** 1) The forbidden/taboo appeal. * 2) The achievement of convincing one’s partner, working up to full PiA sex through potential pain and embarrassment, affirms trust and builds intimacy. * 3) It’s satisfying as a lover to get prostate pressure just right. * 4) It’s something different to do.**Reservations and exceptions:*** 1) Mood, diet, cleanliness and comfort down there are major factors on deciding when to try anal. * 2) Some people are really grossed out by the potential for fecal matter, other people, while not “into” it, don’t think it is a big deal. * 3) Some people who are concerned with the gross factor complain that there is too much preparation involved, or that prep is uncomfortable. * 4) People have reservations about giving anal due to fear of hurting or embarrassing their partner. * 5) People who aren’t into dominating mention repeatedly that they don’t like giving anal for this reason.
fz6d6	-31155	1299522996	sex	FAQ 2.2. – Doesn’t anal play hurt, what are some of the risks?	Have you been hurt or injured in the course of having anal sex?  Are you afraid of pain or injury?  What are some other bad things that can happen from anal?Share your stories.Upvotes for participation!---STD transmission is much more likely with anal sex than vaginal sex.GI bacteria can get into the urethra, causing a painful infection.Under certain conditions, anal sex can be painful. Make sure your partner is ready, use lube, trim your nails, and use caution if you’ve got a large penis. Medical conditions like IBS, ulcerative colitis, Chron’s disease, hemorrhoids and previous injury can make anal play very painful.Some redditors reported minor bleeding, difficulty going to the bathroom for a day or two, and general soreness afterward.And there’s a risk of anal sex being a little gross.Please see FAQ 2.0. for science links related to risks and anal play.
fz6e6	-31155	1299523077	sex	FAQ 2.3. – How do I convince my partner to try anal play? 	Help!  I really want to give/receive anal sex/analingus/pegging/other ass play, but my partner doesn’t want to!  How can I convince him or her?Share your tips.Upvotes for participation.---**Outside the bedroom:**Be patient, and don’t rush into it. Meaning potentially weeks or months of patience, not minutes or hours. Have an open minded, unassuming attitude. The comfort and relaxation of the receiver are key to enjoyable anal sex, so overt pressure will not get you the results you desire.You should initially announce your interest in a straightforward manner outside the bedroom. Try suggesting that your partner explore anal by himself or herself first. Perhaps provide them with a gift certificate to an adult store for lube, a butt plug, and perhaps a book. Much resistance to anal play stems from fear of embarrassment and pain. Pleasuring oneself allows more control of the situation, and with no witness, there’s no reason to be embarrassed. Once one is comfortable with solo anal play, they will be in a position to communicate to you what kind of stimulation feels good to them.It was suggested that you try exploring anal with your partner outside the bedroom. Books on anal sex techniques or positions and/or anal porn can attest to the pleasurable nature of anal sex and make the sex act seem less foreign. Anal porn in particular might backfire, though, as anal porn is sometimes known for its brutality.**In the bedroom:**Elements of non-verbal communication are recommended in the early progression towards anal sex – but this absolutely does not mean that you should surprise your partner with a penis up the butt!The first introduction has to be well timed so that the initial foray could be un-noticed at first. Your partner (the receiver) should be really worked up – you should indulge them in whatever turns them on the most. Once they are extremely turned on, place a finger or your thumb on their asshole. DO NOT INSERT OR MOVE THE FINGER. If you do it right, they won’t really notice but the added stimulation will make them go wild. This is all you’re doing this time.If they don’t say anything about it, or say something positive about it, try it again on a future occasion, but NOT THE NEXT TIME. Working up to anal takes time, because it requires building comfort and trust together. If they express being uncomfortable with it, apologize, and give up.On the second occasion, you can gently make circles around the asshole and let the pad of your thumb or finger stimulate around the inside BUT ON THE SURFACE of the anus. No rectal penetration. Your partner should notice it, but that’s all.At which point, it’s time to talk to your partner about what you’ve done so far, and find out what their attitude, fears and limits are. Establish some rules like what can/can’t go in, around, and have a safe word.The next step is a finger. For the next 2-3 weeks you're going to need 2 things: nail clippers and a file. Try just simple insertion, no in-and-out at first. The ass is sensitive and needs time to adjust.After you've got them enjoying having a finger in their ass, one of two things will happen: they will want you to try fucking their ass, or won't even bring it up. The point is to get them to realize they want your dick in their ass because it feels really good.The next step should be a small toy. After you've had a finger in them for a bit, slip it in (TELL THEM FIRST!). Then, forget that thing is back there for like 15 minutes. Pay attention to your partner’s front side. After a while. put your thumb on the plug, and slowly start to swirl it around. Work that into your routine, and your partner should be clamoring for your dick in no time.
fz6ez	-31155	1299523123	sex	FAQ 2.4. – What are some good positions/techniques for ass play? 	My partner and I are going to try anal sex/analingus/pegging/other ass play for the first time, and we have no idea what we’re doing!  What are some good tips, tricks, positions, and other important ‘how to’ facts?Share your tips.Upvotes for participation.---You shouldn't be in a hurry; slowly and gently is the key.When your finger is fully inserted, make curling motions.When they are ready for it, insert a second finger and make gentle scissoring motions to stretch the passage.Invest in good lube specifically designed for ass play, don't get one that will dry up quickly.You can buy beginner butt plugs and anal beads in small sizes, which are good aids in getting adjusted to anal.Try leaving a plug in for a few hours first to prep up.Don't feel the need to dive straight into pegging/anal etc. Start by getting your partner adjusted to the feeling of something small in their ass while you pleasure them.Take a few weeks where you just introduce basic anal play into your sex routine. If they are more accustomed to the feeling, chances are when the time for anal comes around they will be much more relaxed.Pay attention to how the other person is feeling, they should not feel anything more than slight discomfort. If they are in pain it is because they are not properly prepared! Ass play should be enjoyable, not a terrible agony that you have to endure :)Dudes wanting anal should try taking it themselves.See FAQ 2.0. for book recommendations and links.

fzuwm	-31155	1299604721	sex	FAQ 3.1. – What is Cheating?	What is cheating?  My partner thinks it is cheating when I (masturbate, watch porn, have cyber with strangers on the internet, have sex with other people).  Is it?Share your opinions.Upvotes for participation!---3.1. What is cheating?**The question calls for definitions of cheating and discussion addressing specific behaviors that may or may not be considered cheating within different relationships.** * 1)	Cheating is anything you do with other people that you wouldn’t want your partner to know about or wouldn’t want your partner to do.* 2)	Cheating is breaking the rules.* 3)	Cheating is doing something physical with someone other than your partner.*Support was pretty evenly divided between the first two definitions of cheating, though proposition 1) appears slightly more popular than proposition 2).   Only a few contributors supported proposition 3).***Specific behaviors that might be considered cheating fell into four categories:***a)	Solo sexual: Masturbation, pornography consumption.*  * i.	Supporters of position 1) say not cheating.  * ii.	Supporters of position 2) say maybe cheating, but if so the relationship is probably unhealthy.  * iii.	Supporters of position 2) would assume that these behaviors were not cheating unless an explicit agreement established they were.*b)	Extra partner impersonal: 3rd degree: bachelor parties, lap dances; 2nd degree: phone sex hotline, cyber sex services; 1st degree: seeing a sex professional.*  * i.	Supporters of position 1) say these are cheating if they didn’t want their partner to know about it, or didn’t want their partner to do it. 1st degree universally cheating, 2nd degree, usually cheating, 3rd degree, sometimes cheating.* ii.	Supporters of position 2) are divided on where the line is drawn in terms of whether 1st, 2nd, and 3rd degree behavior are assumed to be cheating or not in the absence of clear rules.  In that event, most supporters see 1st degree as cheating, some see 2nd degree as cheating, and few see 3rd degree as cheating.*c)	Extra partner personal** i.	Sexual: Erotic email, sexting, phone sex, sex chat, and any degree of sexual contact.  Most supporters of all positions would assume these behaviors were cheating in the absence of a specific agreement.* ii.	 Non-sexual: All communication constituting emotional cheating or romantic attachment. Most supporters of positions 1) &amp; 2) would assume these behaviors were cheating in the absence of a specific agreement while supporters of position 3) might not find these behaviors to be cheating.*d)	Lying by omission: crash on buddies couch after illicit drinking, not telling about cheating on a diet, and violating rules in open relationships about protection or disclosures.** i.	Supporters of position 1) didn’t appear to want to make non-romantic issues like the couch or diet “cheating”, but do think that the open relationship situations are cheating.* ii.	Supporters of position 2) find that these behaviors are cheating.* iii.	Supporters of position 3) find that non-romantic issues are not cheating, and might argue it’s impossible to cheat in an open relationship.
fzuxz	-31155	1299604824	sex	FAQ 3.2. - Why do people cheat, is it ever OK?	Why would someone cheat?  What are some circumstances in which it would be ok to cheat, or is it always wrong?Share your opinions.Upvotes for participation!---Borrowed heavily from ABoutDeSouffle excellent summary:Most would argue that cheating is always wrong.Deontologists would find no circumstances where cheating is permissibleConsequentialists would say cheating is wrong but would possibly allow for a discussion if a real good cheater  spares his partner more sorrow by cheating that they would if they were to break with their SO because they are sexually unfulfilled.Virtue ethicists might tell you that man as a morally weak animal will cheat under some circumstances.Sexual desires are different, the ideal amount of sex is different between a lot of partners and temptation by outsiders is and always has been an issue. If these factors come together, the likelihood of someone cheating increases.Cheating has happened in all cultures at all times in all relationships. The death penalty does not keep people from cheating.  I can see how people do not have the guts to ruin a common life with kids, a golden retriever and a house "just" because their partner has lost all sexual interest in them.  It's the easy way out, but "just because" shouldn't be considered so trivial either.Exceptions:The case of an elderly person in a relationship with someone who has dementia (and therefore doesn't have the option of giving consent to an extra partner).The case of someone in an abusive relationship who needs to use sexual favors to gain safe haven outside the abusive relationship.There was discussion of the limit of 'abusive relationship' which was unresolved, but which suggested that if you are not in a position to amend the relationship rules or leave the relationship, cheating may be justified.
fzuz1	-31155	1299604892	sex	FAQ 3.3. - I cheated on my partner, what should I do now?	I know I’m a jerk because I cheated on my significant other, but I really love them and I don’t want to break up with them, what should I do now?  Keep it a secret, tell them and hope for the best?  And what if I cheat again?And/OrHelp! My partner cheated on me, what should I do now!Share your wrath, tips.Upvotes for participation!---***Q1: What should I do if I cheated on my partner?**** A1: Break up with them straight away.  * A2: Confess immediately and hope for forgiveness.* A3: Cover up the cheating.**A1: Break up with them straight away.*** After cheating there is no foundation on which to rebuild a relationship.  If you cheat on your partner, they will be unable to trust that you love them, that you respect them, or that you can be honest with them.  They will know that you do selfish and hurtful things to them.* There was a reason that you cheated.  You are not getting what you want out of that relationship anyway.  Difficulty communicating your wants and needs, and several other problems probably led you to your cheating behavior.  Even if the reason was intoxication, you have personal work to do before you can bring something worthwhile to your relationships.  Work on yourself.* It is the most respectful thing you can do at this point for both yourself and your partner.  You can demonstrate that you want what is best for both parties, it accepts the consequence of your behavior, and it shields your SO from STD risks.**A2: Confess immediately and hope for forgiveness.***  Cheating might (in some cases) be a forgivable offense if you come clean immediately, apologize profusely, and make clear how you’re sure it will never happen again.* Covering up the cheating for any length of time will make forgiveness and reconciliation impossible. Tell them how you feel and how it ended up happening.* Put the ball in their court, and show them respect by giving them all the information you can to help them decide whether they want to kick you to the curb or give you another chance.* There are reasons to hope that you might be forgiven if it’s a one-time drunken mistake or even if it’s the result of certain underlying relationship problems, for example, longstanding issues of sexual incompatibility that might have added pressure for the cheating behavior.  * One redditor expressed that physical contact with someone else would be less of a betrayal than bad-mouthing a spouse behind their back, and several noted that puritanical attitudes in the US about cheating as the ultimate relationship crime aren’t shared by many Europeans, some of whom find extramarital affairs to be normal and expected.**A3: Cover it up.***  If it’s really a one-time thing (be honest with yourself), being honest about it is more trouble than it’s worth – it doesn’t benefit you or your partner for you to unburden yourself.  Sometimes cheating happens because a one-time opportunity presents itself, typically when you’re drunk.  If this, and not some other relationship problem, caused the cheating, it’s not rational to rat yourself out.* COUNTERPOINT: You are a bad bad person for doing this because you expose your partner to STD risks without their consent, even if you have a clean STD test – some STDs don’t show up right away or at all.* COUNTERPOINT: Lying about it is futile – your future relationship won’t be based on honesty and you won’t be able to feel the intimacy you used to have with your partner anymore – basically, a relationship without respect or honesty isn’t worth having.***Q2: My partner cheated on me, what should I do?**** A1: Break up immediately.* A2: Give them another chance.**A1: Break up immediately.*** Your partner cheated on you and you found out from someone else.  What’s the point, there’s no honesty or respect in your relationship, and your “partner” is a coward who can’t even tell you what he’s done, exposing you to risks.* Even if you have children or a mortgage, sometimes divorce is the best thing – better for the children than living in an openly hostile or disrespectful environment.Also see Q1A1 above.**A2: Give them another chance.*** This showed you some problems in your relationship that you couldn’t see before, and you suddenly know how the two of you will address them together.  * You don’t really care because it was just a mistake and they told you about it right away, you maybe have been in a similar situation in the past and see how it could happen to anyone.  * You have children or a mortgage, and you just can’t break up because your relationship has aspects beyond the romantic, friendly, and sexual.  Maybe this means its time for an open relationship and to end some aspects of that relationship, to be considered again at some far future point after trust has been re-established, if it can.
fzuzo	-31155	1299604966	sex	FAQ 3.4. – I want to make out with someone of my own gender, is that cheating if I’m in an exclusive heterosexual relationship?	I know I agreed to be exclusive with my significant other, but I’m a girl and I would really like to make out with this girlfriend of mine.  Would that be cheating if I didn’t get permission first?AndI know I agreed to be exclusive with my significant other, but I’m a man and I’m curious about sucking cock (I’m DEFF not gay).  That’s ok, I can do that experimenting without telling my SO, right?Share your opinions.Upvotes for participation!---Yes, yes it is.  Unanimous consent.However, there was strong support for talking to your SO about it.  Likely talking about experimenting with same-gender curiosity is a less threatening conversation for your SO than talking about a generally open relationship.  Particularly men seemed to mind very little if their SO made out with another hot chick, but still want a chance to consent to it first.There was push-back against this cultural norm, though.  It was noted that considering same-gender dalliances as less serious than opposite gender dalliances delegitimizes homosexual relationships.

What should I tell them about my sexual past?***The majority opinion held that it was unnecessary to disclose that you’ve been a big slut, as long as you don’t have STD.**Don’t volunteer the information because:* Your partner may react with insecurity or adequacy concerns.*  It’s not their business.* You can’t change the past.If they ask:* Have a conversation about whether they really want to know.* Try to wait to have this conversation until you feel safe in the relationship.* You should take the opportunity to teach them about sexual health in general.**The minority opinion held that it was necessary to disclose that you’ve been a big slut, because promiscuity is a risk factor to which your partner has a right to give consent.*** HPV and HSV incidence and detection were discussed.  Men can’t know if they have HPV, and frequently people aren’t tested for HSV.* Discussing who you are openly is a good way to screen out people who won’t be able to accept you for who you are.  If they can’t handle it, you don’t want to date them anyway.* You need to show vulnerability in order to build intimacy and trust in a relationship, and a discussion about your sexual history is an excellent venue.*Help!  I’m very inexperienced, and I'm going to be hooking up with a total slut, what should I tell them about my inexperience?** Be honest about it. The worse that could happen is that you come away with a not-so-amazing experience. * The great thing about it is that you can build up from it and use it to grow into a better lover.* If you disclose, your partner can plan their expectations accordingly, but at the same time, it could put a lot of pressure on your partner, so figure out what’s best for you.* A virgin who doesn’t want to be one should mention their virginity in their online personals ad.  R/Sex has several examples of people who asked for help losing their virginity that were fulfilled by other redditors.*What about my STD status?** If you know you have an STD you must disclose it.* If you have much experience at all, you can’t presume you are STD free even with regular testing.  Men especially can’t assume because there is no way to test for HPV in men.* It’s best to have a discussion about STD status as soon as possible so that if there’s a deal breaker in that conversation, you can escape the relationship with a minimum of investment.*How and when should I have these discussions in my relationship?** Get tested and tell them your STD status before you do anything sexual. This is a no-brainer and an absolute, non-negotiable responsibility. Get tested regularly.  Free/cheap resources through community health clinics and Planned Parenthood are available.* It's important to talk about any sexual experience and STIs before starting any contact that could transmit it. It's respectful to your partner, and you deserve the same common decency in return.* Some people are very worried about getting certain STIs like HPV, so they deserve to know the risks and make up their own mind on something that could affect the rest of their life and all their future partners.---Help!

g0kt0	-31155	1299694092	sex	FAQ 4.1. – How can I/My Partner get more comfortable talking about sex?	Help!  I don’t know how to talk to my partner about sex/my partner won’t talk about sex with me.  What should I do?Please post your general sex communication tricks and tips!Upvotes for participation!---First try: (Wo)Man Up.Be confident in your sexuality.  You like sex, and you want to get better at it, and there’s nothing that can help you as much as talking about it.  Treat sex like the most natural thing in the world (it is), certainly as natural as showering, and when was the last time you had a hard time discussing showering?Failing that:Get Educated.  Knowledge is power and it is an effective means by which to banish fear of the unknown.  Become familiar with your anatomy and your sexual function.  There are a wide variety of books available on human sexuality, or you can just come hang out with us on R/Sex.Talk about your difficulty talking about sex.  Showing your vulnerability to a partner – that you don’t know how to address something – is an important step in building trust and intimacy, and you will find that if you work through the parts of the difficulty that relate to communication itself, the parts that relate to sex will be easier to deal with.  It also gives you and your partner a chance to establish boundaries about what is and isn’t safe to talk about.Tactics:You want to have these meta conversations when there isn’t pressure for sex, although more than one poster suggested having them while naked and involved in non-sexual touching of your partner, because the vulnerability and closeness will help to build trust.Strive to be positive, stay away from negative language.  Include your partner.  Be constructive, have a solution or a try at a solution in mind when you raise a topic.  Bring your partner into the process and try their solution, even if you’re doubtful of it, so that they have an ownership stake in the resolution of the issue.

g6uso	-31155	1300503010	sex	FAQ Update: Answers for Age and Sexuality Compiled	Hi guys. I'm starting to edit together the responses from the FAQ threads, and update the FAQ document linked [here](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/sex).  If someone knows something about formatting/linking other technical stuff in this wiki-formatted document, please let me know... I'm lacking in this area.Here is what I posted:**FAQ 1.0. AGE AND SEXUALITY****FAQ 1.1. Is our age difference creepy?**Don’t date someone under the age of consent in your jurisdiction if you yourself are over the age of consent.There are some equations (yielding different results depending on the inputs) that are commonly used to determine if a person is creepy to date or not:1) (Your Age / 2) + 7 = Minimum acceptable age.2) (Your age – 7) X 2 = Maximum acceptable age. A feature of this equation is that your maximum aged partner can date you un-creepily using equation (1) above.3) (Your Age / 2) – 7 = Number of years age difference allowed (in either direction). Somewhat restrictive on the high end compared to (2) above.4) The square root of your age = number of years age difference allowed (in either direction) Very restrictive on both ends compared to the above choices.There are many people who say that age is just a number and frequently a poor indication of maturity. Many of these people have relationships with larger age differences, and discount the idea that there is anything wrong with their relationships.And it’s generally agreed that a younger person over a certain age (ranging from 18-21, generally, when they’re an adult) hitting on an older person is far less creepy than an older person hitting on a younger (but adult) person.http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/fymuz/faq_11_is_our_age_difference_creepy/**FAQ 1.2. Should I date outside my “creepy range”, why?**If yes, it is essential that the “Campsite Rule” be followed. Simply put, the campsite rule is that one should leave a campsite in better condition than it was in when one arrived. The campsite rule is applicable in any relationship with an unequal power dynamic. Applied here, it means that an older person has a responsibility to make sure that the younger person is treated ethically and is benefiting from the relationship. People who said that yes, people should date outside their creepy range made the following points:1) Age is superficial and being ageist is no better than being closed off to dating on the basis of race, class or political / religious affiliation.2) Women reach their sexual peak around age 35, men reach theirs around age 18, therefore dating outside of the creepy range provides a high degree of sexual compatibility in a case of a younger man dating an older woman.3) Young women are reputed to reach emotional maturity at a younger age; therefore dating outside of the creepy range provides a high degree of emotional compatibility in the case of a younger woman dating an older man.4) Older men and women tend to be more emotionally stable, comfortable in their own skin, and have more life knowledge relative to younger men and women, therefore dating outside of the creepy age range can provide younger men and women a more pleasant and less dramatic relationship than their same age peers.5) Younger men and women have more youthful appearances.People who said that no, people should not date outside their creepy range made the following points:1) There was significant support for the idea that age is a good indicator of maturity. An interesting appendix to this idea was that a younger person dating an older person would experience more personal growth while dating and could become frustrated with lack of personal growth in their partner.2) Relationships between younger people and older people are typified by a power dynamic that is either unhealthy or beneficially mutually exploitative; that is, older people tend to use younger people for sex and younger people tend to use older people for material support.3) It is socially awkward to be seen in public with someone who could be your child or parent but is in fact your date.4) At a certain number of years difference in age, it is inevitable that generational, bodily, and temperamental differences will become a barrier to compatibility.Finally there was a debate about evolutionary psychology and attraction theory, wherein it was claimed that it is natural for older men to date younger women, but not the other way around. This editor took the contrary position - that there is not a clear evolutionary advantage for this configuration. The matter remains controversial.http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/fymxn/faq_12_should_i_date_outside_my_creepy_age_range/

g9qdk	-31155	1300891388	SexatDawn	Study Review: Arousal differences in men and women / sexual orientation.	There was a discussion this morning/last night on r/sex regarding a woman's friend who is heterosexual but only enjoys lesbian porn.That post is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/g9hbv/female_friend_watches_lesbian_porn_and_only/).In the course of that discussion [this study](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/06/030613075252.htm) was cited.  This study is also cited in Sex at Dawn.In short, the study says that heterosexual men showed arousal activity in the brain and genitals while looking at women, homosexual men showed this activity while looking at men, and women showed this arousal activity when looking at both men and women, and also animals copulating, regardless of the viewer's sexual orientation.The study was looking for evidence of a genetic cause for homosexuality, and the unexpected results for women have been interpreted as a 'rape defense' mechanism - that an arousal response in women in the absense of consious attraction to the object of that arousal occurs to minimize the risk of injury during non-consentual sex.---I personally think there is a better explaination than the one proposed by researchers looking for homosexuality genes or rape defense theorists.In general, there is a very strong bias towards the legitimacy of sexology related to procreation - that is, theories that explain sexuality in terms that are limited to the procreative aspects of sexuality are generally siezed upon. The idea that sexuality is primarially for procreation in humans is what leads researchers to suppose that homosexuality is a genetic defect - cause how can homosexuality be good for the species from an evolutionary point of view?But the thing about sexuality in humans and other great apes is that it has a three fold function. Yes, it's for procreation. But it's also for pleasure - there was a recent study that re-did the hatfield clarke 1989 study and found that women were interested in casual sex, as long as they expected it to be pleasurable. And it's for social bonding, that is, sharing your sexuality is a way for you to form partnerships and bonds with other individuals in your smallish hunter-gatherer group.I think women, who have a much stronger oxytocin bond with their offspring than men do, have a much greater need for what Robert Putnam called social capital - basically, the network of connections they could rely upon in times of need. I think social bonding priorities are stronger in women, and this explains their ability to be aroused by a much wider range of stimuli.What do you think?

You know how I love this book.  There were discussions yesterday on r/polyamory that led to the creation of a new subreddit, r/sexatdawn.  I wanted a place to have book/chapter discussions and a dedicated place to move our evolutionary psychology debates, to reduce the number of hijacked threads here on r/sex.I'm also hoping we'll see lots of links to articles that would also be appropriate to r/sex, dealing with the question "why".There are just a couple posts there now, but I hope some of you will stop over and submit content.  Thanks![Here's the subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/sexatdawn)

get54	-31155	1301504494	mnr4r	Someone has to go first, may as well be [M]e.	Hello Minnesota!I'm Justin. I'm 32, and I practice polyamory. That means that my relationships aren't exclusive, and that I maintain multiple relationships of all kinds.I have a four year old boy who is awesome. My wife and I are friends without benefits, parenting and living together. I have two serious girlfriends and a friend with benefits. My relationships are important to me, and I try to treat everyone respectfully.I’m really into politics (I’ve been on the ballot for state legislator), music (I’ve played the piano 25+ years and have a 150GB music collection), excellent television (on DVD mostly), movies (worked for Mr. Movies, Hollywood, and Blockbuster during my HS career), and sexuality and relationships (I’m a moderator for r/sex).---What I’m looking for:I practice bi-sexuality, though (technically) I identify as straight.  I am primarily attracted to women, and don’t tend to develop romantic feelings for men, however, sex with both men and women (together or separately) is pretty fun.  I’m pretty kinky, but I’m a people pleasing switch – very good, giving and game.You should message me if you would like to get some coffee or a drink, or to get to know me a little before going to get some coffee or a drink.I want to be attracted to and excited about someone.I want to share interests, tastes and values with this person so we can have excellent conversations.  I want someone who can be vulnerable with me and is comfortable when I open up to them - that is, I want an emotional connection.I want someone sexually experienced with whom I have good physical chemistry or high sexual compatibility.I suspect that I don’t have enough time to make a good primary partner for another someone out there, but I think I’d be fabulous in almost any other role you can dream up.  I am available 1-2 evenings a week for face time, and I’m pretty good about keeping up correspondence.---References:You can review my posting/comment history here:http://www.reddit.com/user/patientpolyamoristIf you wanted to, you could seek personal reference from my girlfriend here:http://www.reddit.com/user/bacchanteIf you’d like to see pictures of me, you can do that at OK Cupid (SFW photos):http://www.okcupid.com/profile/homeboyposse/Or Fetlife (NSFW photos):http://www.fetlife.com/users/292276

Thank you very much to everyone who has submitted their wisdom for our FAQ.Unfortunately, I am way behind on editing your responses into coherent, paragraph form answers to the FAQ questions.  Topics 1-3 are done, topics 4-24 aren't. Also unfortunate is the fact that after 30 days, posts can no longer be edited.  That means for the oldest topics, there are just a few days remaining until I won't be able to put the answer into the post.And it's my Birthday friday, and I don't intend to spend this weekend editing.So I could use some volunteers.In the sidebar there are two links:[Edited FAQ Threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/gdy0m/edited_faq_threads/)[Unedited FAQ Threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/gdy0y/unedited_faq_threads/)The 'edited' ones are done, the un-edited ones need to be edited.If anyone is interested in helping out, I'd like you to look at at least one of the edited FAQs to see what I did there.  After you've seen how I've summarized the comments in one of the completed threads, you could draft a summary of the comments in one of the unedited threads, for me to review and post.It would be amazingly great if I could find just 2 or 3 people willing to help out - failing that, I'll have to come up with some other theory for how to organize the completed FAQ.

Aparently I've been cast, and she was wondering if I have any time this weekend or next to do a shoot.  So, I'm gonna do a porno.They're still looking for people to participate in the project, if you're interested, see this link:https://www.facebook.com/notes/tsk-minneapolis/artistic-erotic-film-project-needs-you-please-consider-helping-us-make-this-proj/10150125774279495Edit: Spelling.Second edit: Kinda surprised how hot this is... presently #332 on the 'all list' certainly my highest ranked post of all time.

hklmf	-31155	1306413103	sex	Update 2: "So, I actually have an audition for a porno today"	Not only am I in the movie, I'm in the soft-core but still mildly NSFW [trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0Q2-Iq22Bc)! I'm the guy with the stubble in the ~second~ third couple. Edit there, a very embarrassing one.This past weekend was a little crazy in north Minneapolis where I live. My neighborhood was really pretty badly hit by a tornado on Sunday afternoon while I was shooting. Luckily, my home and family were ok. And the footage we shot was really hot, if I do say so myself.I went to a cast mixer on Saturday morning, ate some food with 20 or so sexy cast and crew, and chatted for a few hours. I hit it off with a very nice 98% lesbian lady, and in the course of trying to smoke a cigarette in a torrential downpour, she mentioned that she was really only into girls, but that for "the right guy" she might be willing to strap up and be a top. I interpreted that to mean she wanted to top me on film.At the end of the morning, Jennifer (SK's owner) had us fill out a piece of paper indicating who we were and with whom we thought we might be able to work. The lesbian and I had listed one another, and being queer-friendly post porn, the crew was really excited about the match.We arranged to shoot our scene Sunday afternoon.Jennifer, being the owner of a sex toy store, brought along the VixSkin [Goodfella](http://www.vixencreations.com/store/goodfella.html), which I found to be a not too very intimidating tool (still, a little intimidating). I got to take the toy home after I used it in my scene (I guess there's not a big market for used toys).The shooting focused on three aspects of a sexual experience - the slow overhead kissing/carressing/cuddling before and after play, a slow motion deepthroat, and a somewhat softcore presentation of the penetration.They took at least 8 takes of the deep throat from different angles, and penetration a few times as well. My screen partner only tolerated the 'kiss like you're going to start having sex' instruction a couple, maybe three times before complaining that my stubble was chafing her, but we watched the footage immediately after shooting, and we got some really good stuff.The director and crew seemed to really like the work I did, and me, and they're having me back this weekend to do some more filming. Not entirely clear how they're going to use me yet - I heard some rumor that they want to get a female ejaculation scene in there and that they may utilize my, ahem, talents, for that. I hope so!This has been a really fun and awesome experience so far. If someone offers you a chance to be in an art porn, I say go for it.I believe the director is being interviewed on the Sex Is Fun ([SIF](http://sexisfun.net)) podcast on Monday next week, and the trailer is posted there now (along with ways you can still participate if you're in Minneapolis).Edit: Youtube appears to have taken down the trailer. I wrote the director and producer asking if they have an alternate video hosting plan, I'll fix links here as I can, sorry about that guys.Edit 2: The 30 second trailer is still up, I don't appear in this one, but that link should behttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTL8qB5i2k&amp;feature=relatedEdit 3: They're working on it now, it will be hosted at the sex is fun site, I'll fix links when I get back from lunch.---Original Post:http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/gbeuh/so_i_actually_have_an_audition_for_a_porno_today/TL;DR - Went on my lunchbreak to try out for a porno, somebody's film school master's project, produced by the owner of the Smitten Kitten. Audition went well - low key, chatted with the director, producer, art director, had some nude photos taken.Update 1:http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/hcjvo/update_so_i_actually_have_an_audition_for_a_porno/TL;DR - Got an email saying I was cast in the porno.

ho905	-31155	1306853010	IAmA	IAMA “Post-Porn” Actor, AMA.	Over the past two weekends, I was pegged by a lesbian, made a girl squirt, and got blowjob from a guy, on camera, for the film “Porn, a film by Benjamin Noble.”You can see the soft-core but still kind of NSFW trailer [here](http://www.sexpertslounge.com/2011/05/27/porn-a-film-by-benjamin-noble/). I’m the guy with the stubble in the third couple.Ben wrote the movie as part of his masters’ degree program for film school, but didn’t have to make it to finish his degree. When Jennifer, the owner of the [Smitten Kitten](http://www.smittenkittenonline.com), heard about the project she decided she’d produce it. I learned about the project after reading about it at the SK Facebook page.Basically, it’s a limited release, art-house type soft-core movie that has no plot and tries to get at issues of gender identity, sexual orientation, and the process of losing track of oneself during sexual activity.  It’s a really interesting project, was incredibly fun to help make, and yielded some pretty good stories (not to mention hot footage), if I do say so myself. I have written about the project a few times for r/sex: [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/gbeuh/so_i_actually_have_an_audition_for_a_porno_today/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/hcjvo/update_so_i_actually_have_an_audition_for_a_porno/), and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/hklmf/update_2_so_i_actually_have_an_audition_for_a/), and those threads have been pretty popular. I thought IAMA readers might be interested in it as well.TL;DR : I’m a porn star, ask me anything.

We could use two or three more civically minded people who care about the community (r/sex). Computer smarts aren’t required (but would be useful), but moderators do need to at least know their way around reddit.Please nominate your fellow r/sex contributors or volunteer yourself.**Duties**Day to day, moderators of r/sex have just a few tasks to complete:* Answer moderator mail.* Remove links that aren’t relevant to the subreddit.* Add NSFW tags to links that require them.* Rescue posts from the spam filter.* Represent r/sex across reddit, and try to grow the community.* Politely remove abusive comments.Other responsibilities:Moderators are civil servants to the Reddit they moderate. They interpret the reddiquette, determine moderation policies, and enforce those policies. At R/Sex, these appear in the sidebar.Moderators act in good faith in setting moderation policies that r/sex readers prefer, to the extent the reddiquette allows. Moderators and r/sex readers can clarify and refine these policies through discussions like [this one]( http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/gd7k0/please_be_nice/). Alert the moderators of the policy you’d like modified or clarified and request a discussion about it. Moderators will post and distinguish a thread on the topic. Such discussions allow the moderators to understand what the sub-reddit thinks, and make sure rules can be fairly enforced and easily understood.Edit:Thanks guys, I really appreciate the interest in this. Feel free to keep volunteering/nominating - I'll take a look at the nominees' reddit histories and consider the choices over the weekend.

If we ever create some revenue, we would love to pay the staff, but for now, all we can offer is a title and an audience.

If you visit his subreddit, you'll notice the awesome buttons he has instead of links on the sidebar, for one example. His role will be limited to technical/design issues and consultation on "mod hacks" - he's a fairly experienced moderator and can offer advice where I might otherwise have to look something up.Please join me in welcoming our new mods.

Generally we publish articles that are 250-2500 words. Regardless of your experience writing or your assessment of your writing skills, we'd love you to submit that piece of advice you're always giving, an article around a crazy fact you learned, or anything else you think might be appropriate. We do have editors who will work with you to improve the copy you provide.The blog is minimally monitized (we have a donate button that has thus far resulted in total revenues of $10.00) and as a result, we are not able to offer compensation for content at this time.You do retain intellectual property rights to anything you author (so theoretically could sell the content to someone else).

Hey r/poly!So this month, all three of my girlfriends and my non-sexual/romantic wife managed to get their periods at almost the same time. A got hers, B got hers 2 days later, C got hers 2 days after that, and D got hers 2 days after that. I'm not squimish, so this hasn't caused any sexy time problems, but it is a bit tiresome to have everyone in a bad mood and crampy all at the same time.Can anyone relate, and do you have any suggestions for helping to spread them back out a bit?
jxxi8	-31155	1314623822	sex	Major change proposed for r/sex - Self Posts ONLY - Discussion Opportunity.	Hi Guys.Because of [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/jvqjn/hey_guys_a_proposal_to_possibly_keep_rsex_great/) thread, there is a serious discussion going on among moderators at the moment about whether we should fundamentally change the nature of this subreddit - from a place where thought provoking self-posts and links are encouraged to a place where only self-posts are allowed.We have from time to time flirted with a change of this or the opposite nature in the past - at one time there was a great deal of dissatisfaction that r/sex had gotten filled up with lots of people asking the same relationship-advice type questions.At that time, I argued that we should not limit self-posts, and at this time, my view is that we should not limit links either.Sure, two or three or even 7 or 8 times a week there's a link to imgur that is, well, dumb - doesn't add anything to the discussion, doesn't amuse us. In my view, those are why we have a down arrow.The links posted to science articles, to actually amusing sites or pictures, or to other relevant reddit posts (x-posts) historically far outnumber these. Based on the thread I linked at the top, there is a lot of support for the idea of self-posts only, and I think that moderators here are prepared to make a change along these lines unless a great many of you speak up and say that, like me, you enjoy finding the sex-related highlights of the internet here alongside people's requests for help with their sexual relationships.

lhfe6	-31155	1319028875	sex	Ladies, does sex make you sore, and after how long?	I'm blessed (or cursed) with quite a bit of stamina - I routinely go an hour or more - but my partners have only complained of soreness after really, really epic sessions.Yesterday, though, I heard from a couple of people who get sore with much less activity that this, and that additional lubrication had not been found to help.I was wondering what your experiences with soreness after sex were, how long you generally go, and if you have any ideas why some people's vaginas seem to have a lot more tolerance than others.

nqcyw	-31155	1324839741	sex	Merry Christmas R/Sex!	Happy Holidays, Everyone!Christmas is upon us. It started as the least sexy of all holidays, what with that whole immaculate conception thing and the Christianization of a Pagan holiday, but over the years, various innovations, like red lace and floppy, fur rimmed velvet hats, have slowly but surely re-sexualized the ancient Winter Solstice Festival that was re-purposed as the birthday celebration for the king of kings. I do celebrate Christmas, though I'm a bit iffy on the whole "son of God" thing, just between you and me. I love the sentiment that the holiday is a time for giving. For me, and I think probably many of you, the giving was a little thin this year. Times are tough, and my Christmas budget, like many comprehensive sex-education budgets, faced draconian cuts. As a result, I did not buy you guys a Porshe for Christmas this year.I've never had a Porshe. But it has always seemed to me that I'd be much better at hooking up if I had one. I'm not saying you guys could use the help -- just that you all mean a lot to me and I wish I could do something nice for you that would actually make life easier.This was my third christmas since I started doing the poly thing. It was filled with Family - my family of origin; my wife and son; my partner, her husband, and their children; and my girlfriend and her husband. These people take care of me and treat me as their own blood and kin - and they all deserved a lot more for Christmas than I could give them. Not just at christmas, but all the time, they do nice things that make my life easier, and sexier, and more delicious -- more fun.You guys do too.So while only one of you sent me a fist full of porn (aside, the Not-Brady's, incredibly awesome, but would have been better without the sex, thank you so much!), and as far as I know none of you have ever replied to one of my R4Rs (let alone made me a sandwich afterward), I wanted to say, sincerely, happy holidays and thank you for everything you do to help keep things sexy. -PP

2jciqi	-31155	1413402261	sex	Do something about the stigma against HSV?	I'd like to somehow have a major national campaign that succeeded at eroding the stigma about HSV. Additionally, there are laws that make it aggravated assault to transmit an infectious disease that can and have been applied to HSV in extremely horrifying ways, and I would like this national campaign to result in their being repealed, amended, or interpreted by courts not to include HSV as an "infectious disease" which is defined in statute generally as one that can cause "significant bodily harm".For example, if the person to whom the infection was transmitted gave informed consent to risk prior to exposure, in many states, the person who transmitted the virus would be not guilty or not liable, however, courts have found that unless the person transmitting the virus is a medical professional, they can't adequately inform the person who got the virus of those risks, and therefore found the person liable. In all states, if you do not know your HSV status, you cannot be found guilty.The CDC recommends testing under limited conditions, not for everyone, and Planned Parenthood in my city gives people counseling not to get tested for HSV due to the stigma attached to it. I was tested a while ago, wasn't counseled in that manner, and thought it was the right thing to do since I engage in high-risk sex practices. Worst mistake of my life.I'm extremely open about my status online, it was in my profiles and things. I joined a swingers group on fetlife, talked to a moderator about my status and asked them to clarify the "be responsible" rule about sexual health safety for my particular case (which they did not do), then asked that same moderator for an invitation to a play party, which I attended.People in the group with whom I did not play, later viewed my profile and raised a stink, a rather horrible stench really, about how it was possible that a moderator knew that I had an "incurable disease" and was still invited to a party, and demanded that anyone with an STD be denied membership to the group, as well as calling for this moderator to be sacked.The conversation about this happened when another moderator, who must have tried to find out if any of the moderators knew my status when I was invited to the party, asked a theoretical question about what members would think if they found out a moderator invited a person with a disease to a party. It went on for a day before I saw it.When I did, I tried to respond to it with statistics and expressed my disappointment that so many people who were engaged in high-risk behaviors knew so little about the risks they were accepting, and took so little personal responsibility to protect themselves from those risks by asking about other people's statuses before play. I was extremely offended. I was threatened with legal action. So I said that I wouldn't want to be in a group with so many people who were a serious danger to my sexual health because of their ignorance. I named the moderator whom I had disclosed the information to, so the comment disappeared almost immediately.I left the group, unfriended everyone connected to me on fet, and deleted my account. Also deleted my OKC account, and figured while I was at it, resigning here was probably timely at this point.Lost my faith in the internet for a minute there.So I'd like to do something about that. Not my faith in the internet, r/sex helped with that (WTG). I want to do something about the number one threat to people's health resulting from HSV, which even the CDC now says is the stigma surrounding the virus and the depression and other ill effects that result.Maybe you do know what I can get involved with to do that... do you?

So I replaced the treadmill with the elliptical.6 days a week I go to the gym and start of with 30 min on the elliptical (Interval), then the original p90 level 3-4 (alternating sculpt and sweat), followed by another 30 on the elliptical (Again interval). I try to keep it between 1200-1500 calories a day. I do use protein powder and creatine in shakes (between 2-4 scoops of protein a day blended with almond milk and a banana).I hope after a month of this my ankles will be strong enough to run (following the 10k trainer guide) and advance to doing the p90x and then p90x3 routines.Am I on the right track? I also have a gym buddy that wants to adopt this routine but I thought I'd check with you guys first.

After a couple months of working out more and more steadily I believe I am ready for a real program like the ICF novice program. But I am unsure how the 1 rep max applies. I Found it individually for squats, bench press and deadlift (I hope, my form feels weird?). Now do I need to find it for the Standing Press, Bent Over Row, Close Grip Bench Press, Straight Bar, Incline Curls and Cable Crunches?

2zpskt	-31170	1426870281	BasicIncome	Let's talk about the real elephant in the room: Housing	When I look at my income, 25% of it goes to housing, and for some people it's a high as 50% or more. The cost of housing/rent is a big problem. So let's ask, why is so much? Is it land? Nope, there is plenty of land in the U.S. The problem is everyone wants to live as close to work as possible. Thus the land inside cities (and thus the rent) becomes much more expensive than the land out in the middle of nowhere. This can be solved by building upwards. So why don't we build more hi rises? Is it because technology hasn't lowered the building costs enough? Or is it the laws and restrictions we have in some areas? If we can solve this problem it would increase the supply of housing and lower rents and such.

r526t	-31190	1332251670	Objectivism	Can anyone else identify with this perspective on AR's philosophy?	I have a friend who is vaguely familiar with AR (read her books in college).  We had a discussion in which I expressed how Rand had changed my perspective on life, and I tried to summarize it in one paragraph.  I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this, thanks!&gt;"At the heart of it is the idea that the only person responsible for and capable of securing my own happiness and fulfillment in life, is me. [Ayn Rand] taught me to look at the world as an active agent, not a passive observer; to realize that, while there are many things beyond my control in life, I can still use my mind and my life to be productive, positive, and great in the things that I do. And not only that, I learned to look at other people that way too. That's one reason I started the ALT.NET group [educational group for programmers] -- because I believe that there is greatness in people, and those are the people I want to be around. Another thing her books emphasize is that people are "traders" -- that we give and take, in both material and non-material ways, and this trading is what allows many individuals to act in concert as a society. Its easy to understand this in terms of physical things -- I trade my labor for a paycheck, for example. But we also trade in emotions, encouragement, knowledge, etc. Because Rand views people as heroic, and capable of greatness, she emphasized that when you trade "value for value" with someone, you should always trade your best for their best, realizing that by doing so, you have increased the sheer amount of AWESOME in the world. This is the honest way of living."

y79zd	-31190	1344951989	compsci	Is there a resource that teaches math through programming?	Some quick background: I am a programmer that works primarily on enterprise systems, and my math knowledge is very weak.  I'd like to learn more about math, but every text I try to read confuses me and I get frustrated quickly.  I was reading a blog post today about "[the myth of superprogrammers](http://simpleprogrammer.com/2012/08/12/the-myth-of-the-super-programmer/)" where the author gave an example of [a math equation and used a simple `for` loop to illustrate what was happening with the math notation](http://f.cl.ly/items/131k1x3N041q113Q0s1I/Screen%20Shot%202012-08-14%20at%208.28.13%20AM.png).  I had an "ah-ha!" moment and realized that this would be an excellent way for me to become familiar with math concepts, by referencing a field with which I am pretty familiar.  I know a lot of programmers already have a math background, but since I'm approaching this from the other direction, I was wondering if there are any texts, websites, or videos out there that take this approach.  Any suggestions would be most welcome!

120tls	-31190	1351107294	javascript	help explaining constructor property	Hi everyone, I've been doing JS for a while now and I still struggle when I see code manipulating prototypes, so I've written down some short notes about how prototypes work and I'd like some feedback from you all--if there is anything I have misunderstood, or anything I should add or remove.  Thanks!---**Prototypes**When the `prototype` property of a constructor function is set to an object instance, all objects created with that constructor function will "inherit" the prototype object.    function Lawnmower() { this.brand: 'snapper'; }    Lawnmower.prototype = { category: 'lawn equipment' };    var snapper = new Lawnmower();    console.log(snapper.category); //lawn equipmentWhen an object instance is created from a constructor function after the constructor function has had its prototype set deterministically, the value of the object's inherited `constructor` property returns the `Object` constructor function (because that was the constructor function of the prototype instance).  This can be manipulated by setting the `constructor` property of the constructor function's prototype to the constructor function itself.    function Mac() { this.os = 'osx' };    Mac.prototype = { category: 'computers' };    var m = new Mac();    console.log(m.constructor); //Object    Mac.prototype.constructor = Mac;    m = new Mac();    console.log(m.constructor); //MacObject instances have no `prototype` property.  You cannot change the prototype of an object instance.  Some browsers include a non standard `__proto__` property to gain access to the prototype object directly.The `Object` function has a method called `isPrototypeOf()` that can be used to determine the nature of an object instance's prototype.
127x4n	-31190	1351435315	Objectivism	interesting quote by Andrew W. K.	I found this quote a while ago. I don't know much about Andrew W. K. other than he's a party rocker, but the quote really struck me as something that is fairly compatible with my own personal beliefs, and Objectivism in general. This was given in response to the question: *"I'm dating a guy who refuses to give up on his dreams of rock stardom.  While it's admirable in a way, I need a little more stability if we're going to make this work. How can I gently break this to him?"*Andrew's response:&gt; "Don't you dare say anything to him about giving up his dreams.  You're not the right person for him.  Never ask someone to give up on their dreams just so you can feel more stable.  It's his choice and his choice alone, no matter how ridiculous his dream may seem to you, or to society, or even to himself.  Dreams make humans into self-realized individuals.  Your only responsibility is to love everything about him, including his dreams.  The idea of 'making this work' sounds more like a way to make his life more boring and predictable.  At worst, it's a genuine sadistic desire to control someone else because your own life feels out of control -- or a cruel need to dominate and break someone's spirit for the sake of your own peace of mind.  Look for stability and peace of mind inside yourself, and not in your relationships or dreams of others."

I spend a significant amount of time working from home and I'm looking for good remote-work locations in the St. Louis area to change up the scenery.  I like coffee shops, but I'm open to anything, really.  I'm not interested in co-working locations unless they are free or I can buy a cheap day pass.  All I really need is a decent free wifi connection (sometimes I do video chats and internet calls with skype), a comfortable table with nearby electric outlets, and a semi-quiet work area. (Ambient, coffee-shop level noise is fine.)  If anyone has any suggestions, I'd be most grateful!

If more spaces open up I will post an update here.**Hello friends! I am taking Brandon Sanderson's BYU lecture series this year at [writeaboutdragons.com](http://www.writeaboutdragons.com/). I know several other redditors are as well. I have created a google community for those interested in following the course, who want to write and submit to the group for critiques. We plan to meet once a week via google hangout, probably for an hour or two during the evening. Here are the criteria we are following:- Write a total of 30,000 words- Write ~2,000 - 4,000 words per week- Submit 1,000 words per week to your writing group (optionally 2,000 if you are hardcore!)- Post submissions by midnight on Monday- Writing groups should meet for 1 hour, and spend ~10 mins. on each submissionIf you are interested in joining please fill out the [invitation request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tDmzVQW5I5WBcEwkTsduXVVkexShpbfrH0kCcUSTj-8/viewform) or PM me (/u/darkroastbeans); the group is invite-only so I will need to send you a community invitation. Please only contact me if you are actually taking the course. There are many other good public writing group services (e.g., Scribophile) that will serve your needs better if you are not enrolled.First submissions are due this Monday (15th) though I believe Sanderson is allowing for some latitude because this is the first week of the course. Hangout times will be posted in community chat.Feel free to ask questions.EDIT: To join the google community and participate in hangouts you must have a [Google+ account](http://plus.google.com).

I was drunk but managed to [sketch a diagram on a paper plate](http://i.imgur.com/zOplyOm.jpg). She said it was really helpful and it has been stuck with a magnet on the front of our fridge ever since.It's basically a continuum that covers both physical and psychological attraction, and how they overlap. The bars at the top represent the characteristics I think men associate with words like "cute", "beautiful" and "hot": "personality", "face", and "body" respectively. The bars at the bottom represent the impressions those ideas have on men; e.g., "cute" has a more psychological impression, whereas "hot" has a more physical impression.The golden spot, in this continuum, is right in the middle where a woman has a good balance of qualities. Which of course, is where my wife is :)Thoughts on this are appreciated!

22x5ls	-31190	1397394653	MensRights	men should be silent so women have a voice	Greetings!There is an ongoing debate that is raging in my industry right now for which there are virtually no public proponents for the male point of view. I have been a software developer for about a decade. I've always loved computers and taught myself to program at a young age. My industry is probably 70-90% male, like most "STEM" fields, and the social justice warriors have moved right in to hold the industry captive to their endless stream of tweets and shaming. (I'm sure you heard about Adria Richards and "donglegate".)There are a lot of software development conferences all over the world, and a trend that has slowly but consistently infiltrated this space is the mentality that men should step down from being speakers when there is an otherwise qualified woman available to take a spot; also, that men should remain silent when there are women who wish to speak on technical topics, in order to "give women a voice." I recently had a discussion with a (female) colleague about this, and she wrote a blog post justifying this position (http://bit.ly/1n4dmZd). I obviously disagree with her ideas and plan to write a blog post in response. My chief argument is going to be that silencing some to accommodate others actually lowers the net positive discourse, thus doing a disservice to the community as a whole (as the number of viewpoints, in total, is either static, assuming one man is silent for every one woman that speaks, or is greatly reduced, assuming that most men will be silent so few women can speak). Any insights here would be appreciated!

I kept it casual but as we approached the finish line I blasted ahead of her and stayed in front, even though she tried to catch up. Right before I crossed the finish line I reached back and grabbed her hand, pulling her forward, and we finished together with the exact same time.After, she said to me: "When you passed me the only thing I could think of was beating you, but when you reached back for me the only thing I wanted was to hold your hand."Benevolent dominance winning!

Now I'll be working with a pretty modern PHP web application and I'm looking to read up on things that have changed, both in the language, tools, and community in general. I'll be perusing the official docs and links in the subreddit FAQ, but any additional resources would be most welcome!
2loyem	-31190	1415471640	PHP	PSR-2 - why mixed brace positions?	I'm just getting back into PHP and I'm particularly baffled about the mixed brace position conventions in [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2), specifically why the opening braces of classes and methods appear on the next line, but for control structures (like if, while, for, etc.) the braces appear on the same line. In most other languages I've worked with, the convention is not split like this. Is there a particular reason this was done? Or was it just to get everyone to stop arguing :)

As such he named me as his power of attorney so I can pay his bills for the next year while he is overseas. Anyway, I got a bill from Chase Bank saying he owed about $150 for the hotel he stayed in the night before he flew out. This was from a USCG credit card. So I paid it. His mail is forwarded to me. A couple of days ago he  got a letter from USCG Finance Center saying he had an outstanding travel advance for the $150.  It listed a number to call, of course I just heard music (on hold) forever. So what is the deal? Was I supposed to pay it and then get reimbursed, or was I just supposed to send the bill to them? Since the bill was paid by me, how do I get reimbursed since I am not in the USCG?  And why isn't the Finance Center answering the phone? Thanks.

1y06jf	-31212	1392495365	madisonwi	Review of Republic Wireless in the Madison Area	Hi, this is in response to the Ting review on this [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/1wkyo5/tings_mobile_service_in_madison_full_review/)  a couple of weeks ago. I have been using Republic Wireless since January 23rd so I have had it for three weeks now. I liked how theoryface set up the review, so yeah I am going to plagiarize his format.Three weeks ago we switched from US Cellular basic phone service to Republic Wireless. The wife and I  were paying $100 per month for three phones. We each had a cell phone and we used another cellphone as a "home" phone.  We decided that the third phone was redundant and got rid of it. For the $100 we got 700 minutes of shared voice and text. No data. We are now paying $25 each per phone for unlimited voice, text and 5GB  of 3G data.So theoryface threw out a referral code. If you find this useful and decide to switch to Republic we each get a $19 credit. My code is http://referrals.republicwireless.com/a/clk/27sq7TBackground.With Republic Wireless you don't get options with your phone. Upfront you pay $300 for a Moto X smartphone. You get two options - black or white. They do say they are planning on cheaper phones in the next couple of months. Since I have never used a smartphone before, this is pretty cool. The Moto X is a great phone, but I have nothing to compare it to. There are a couple of subreddits you can also check out, r/motox and r/republicwireless.About Republic WirelessRepublic wants you to use your home internet connection to make your phone calls. They don't require you to do that, but is is expected if possible. Actually that is the main reason we switched. The wife and I live in an area that is kind of a valley in Madison. In addition we have a steel roof on the house. Using both ATT and US Cellular we constantly had dropped calls at the house. It was just easier to walk outside to talk. With the internet connection we have not had that problem. Republic also has some weird system that transfers calls from internet to wireless. So if the phone rings in the house and I am just leaving, I can jump in the car and the call stays connected. It switches seamlessly from internet to wireless and does seem to work for me.So the plans are $5 for unlimited talk, text and data per month over the internet. Super cheap but you can't use wireless.$10 per month for unlimited talk and text over the internet or wireless plus unlimited data over internet. Really cheap if you just want a phone and text without data.$25 per month. This is the plan I am using. Unlimited talk, text and 3G data (they say unlimited but throttle after 5GB) $40 per month. Same as the $25 plan but you get 4G coverage instead of 3G.The Order.I ordered the two Moto X phones and the $25 phone plans. The phones arrived within a few days and were ready to use out of the box.  They do have a 30 day return policy on the phone and service. I was a little nervous about spending $600 for two phones that may not work. The 30 day trial period helped ease my worries. Each phone came with its own phone number.  After a week of using the phones we decided we liked them enough to keep them. We then ported over the phones to our old numbers. The porting process was super easy to do over the internet and we had our new phone numbers in less than 24 hours. The Service.Like theoryfaces review of Ting, Republic Wireless also uses the Sprint network. That can cause some problems as Sprint in Madison can be a bit spotty. I get 4-5 bars downtown and near the airport, but in other areas it can go down to 1-2 bars. Even so, I have not had any dropped calls in the Madison area.  In my house the reception is geat, I don't drop any calls because it is going through the internet. The only problem is the sound at times is a bit "tinny". As for customer service, Republic is mostly internet based. They don't have a toll free number that I can find.  Before I ordered I wanted to find a discount code (yeah I am a cheap ass) and could not find one. I went on the facebook page of Republic and was given a referral code almost immediately and saved $19 on my first months phone bill. Speaking of phone bills, Republic bills over the internet. So no paper bills.  In addition you can switch between the 4 plans up to twice a month. So if the 3G plan is not working you can switch to 4G or vice versa to save some money that month. I was reading up about the difference between 3 and 4G and a lot of places said there is not much difference. For that reason I chose the 3G. I really don't use the 3G except at work on breaks and lunches and it works superfast for surfing the web. Of course I should put a caveat on that - there is a cell tower in the parking lot where I work.  So I am within 300 yards of the tower while at work. In other places it is a lot slower.  In the three weeks I have used about 750mb of useage, not even close to the allotted 5GB. The wife works in Belleville south of Madison. She gets good reception in Belleville and on her way to and from Madison. One other thing I should mention about the service is they DO NOT HAVE International calling at this time. You can't call  to Mexico, Europe or anywhere else in the world. On the other hand, if you are in a foreign country you can use the phone to call via the internet to the United States.The VerdictI like the price, I like the home reception through the internet and I like the data.  The only problem is with Sprint coverage in the area. I have heard they are upgrading and getting better. The international calling restriction may be a problem with some people.  The lack of phone choices is also a problem. You get one choice, a Moto X. Also you can't switch to Republic and use your old phone such as a Galaxy or Iphone.  You can't even use your Moto X if you currently have one with another carrier.  Even though I spent $600 on new phones, I should make that up in less than one year from what I was paying on my old phone. I will be happy to answer any questions...

1zkszx	-31212	1393977165	bartenderstories	Harmonica man	I have bartended off and on for years. I was bartending about 30 years ago in Wisconsin on a Monday night. Monday nights are usually slow and boring but tonight the Green Bay Packers are playing on Monday Night Football.The bar is full and this guy comes in and asks for a beer. I give him one and he pays in change, like nickles and dimes. I figured he was homeless, not that it matters. The Packers are on the TV, bar is full and the homeless guy pulls out a harmonica and starts playing it. Ok, not playing it but blowing into it. Loud, obnoxious, screeching, ear splitting NOISE. I go up to him and nicely ask him to put away the harmonica cause of the game. "Sorry sir, yes sir, sorry I bothered you and the customers" and away goes the harmonica into his pocket.For five minutes, and then the screeching begins again. All he is doing is blowing into the harmonica, loudly, no musical notes whatsoever. Once again I tell him to put it away, once again he profusely apologizes and puts it away.Five minutes later he is blasting away on the thing again. Three strikes and you are out buddy.  I go around the bar and gently tell him he has to leave. Now I ain't a big guy, about 5 foot 8 and 160 pounds. This guy looks at me and says " I'll leave, right now, just don't beat me up. Please don't hit me, I will leave. Don't hurt me."  I just gently took him by the elbow and showed him the door. Never saw him again.

(a) No pedestrian may walk upon any roadway outside of abusiness or residence district otherwise than close to his or herleft-hand edge of the roadway."    I don't even know wtf that means. Can anyone explain it?   Here is the video made by Ricky Munday.  He videos cops and tries arguing with them but he does make some points. My question is,  what the heck does that law say?

zu85r	-31213	1347567184	trailrunning	What would be a good shoe for this type of terrain?	I'm 23/m from San Diego (so rain and snow is not a factor).  I want to get into trail running.What would be a good shoe for a trail like this: [ONE](http://i.imgur.com/3tNEF.jpg), [TWO](http://i.imgur.com/au4Y5.jpg), [THREE](http://i.imgur.com/0dNtS.jpg)This is Cowles Mountain, a popular hiking trail in San Diego.I was thinking of getting the Inov-8 Trailroc 245s, would those be good?  I haven't tried them on before.I've already tried the Kinvara TRs and found them uncomfortable because the left shoe was pressing against the pinky side of my foot.  I've also tried the MT10 and it felt like it was squeezing the middle of my feet.  Is this something that eases once broken in?And I've tried the MT1010, which I kinda liked, but it felt a little loose--extra wiggle room for my toes.I've also tried the Inov-8 X-Talon 190, I kinda liked the fit of these, but they look like cleats... I've heard these are designed for fell running in England.This is my first time buying running shoes and I'm totally lost!!  Any help is appreciated.

2bha5r	-31232	1406105502	podemos	Podemos: ingeniería social?	Créeis que es posible que Podemos se trate de un caso de disidencia controlada? Es decir, un partido que simula estar en contra del PPSOE pero en realidad pretende canalizar el descontento para que no se produzcan cambios reales. Estoy bastante preocupado por eso, es demasiado bueno para ser verdad que exista un partido así. ..El hecho de que aparezca constantemente en la TV no me trabquiliza, por quéiban a darle altavoz los poderes financieros? Si lo que quieren es audiencia pueden criticar a podemos sin llamar a Pablo Iglesias no?
2c8bhc	-31232	1406806525	podemos	Pagar por ser afiliado?	Acaba de decir una portavoz de Podemos en la tele que los afiliados van a pagar una cuota.Porque no se nos ha avisado? En ninguna parte dice que se iba a tener que pagar. Cómo puedo dejar de ser afiliado? y no habíamos quedado que no iban a haber afiliados? Cada vez nos parecemos más a un partido convencional.
2cetzn	-31232	1406969500	podemos	Cómo escoger a los magistrados del Tribunal Constitucional y el Tribunal Supremo?	Todo el mundo sabe que el TC y el TS son órganos totalmente politizados. Los Magistrados del TC los escogen PPSOE en su mayor parte, y solo dos magistrados los escoge el Consejo General del Poder Judicial, también politizado.Por su parte, todos los Magistrados del TS los escoge también el CGPJ. Hay que cambiar el sistema de nombramiento, pero...cuáles son las alternativas? Se os ocurre una forma de que los magistrados que integran estos organos no sean nombrados por los políticos de turno?
2cvvcn	-31232	1407421037	podemos	Podemos quiere eliminar las vallas fronterizas?	Es lo que van diciendo los anti-podemos, pero yo leyendo el programa entiendo que lo que se quiere eliminar son las concertinas únicamente. Es así o no?

2d98bj	-31232	1407781190	podemos	Eliminar el SIVE	En el programa de Podemos dice que se va a eliminar el SIVE (Sistema Integrado de Vigilancia Exterior). Pero, por qué? No es mas que un sistema para detectar embarcaciones que se acercan a la costa y poder determinar si son ilegales, no veo que tiene de malo...

2dq75l	-31232	1408203772	podemos	Cómo regular el uso de los Reales Decreto-Ley?	A tenor del artículo 86 de la Constitución, los Reales Decreto Ley sólo se pueden aprobar en casos de "extraordinaria y urgente necesidad". Al ser este un concepto tan indeterminado, se puede hacer un Decreto Ley con cualquier excusa. El Tribunal Constitucional, además, que yo recuerde, no anula ni uno, le falta coraje.Cómo evitar este flagrante abuso de la figura del Decreto Ley? Se ha visto que el hecho de que deba ser ratificado por las Cortes unos días después es insuficiente. 
2dsvwt	-31232	1408286954	podemos	La difamación de Podemos y ETA ha llegado al extremo	Antena 3 ha sacado una noticia diciendo que los portavoces de Podemos en el País Vasco defienden el acercamiento de presos, lo cual es defender la ley y los derechos humanos. Sin embargo, se ha malinterpretado y se está diciendo que los de Podemos son etarras. No es una difamación más, creo que nos puede hacer mucho daño. Alguna idea?
2epw8s	-31232	1409142033	podemos	Quién es Angel Gimeno?	Hoy en las Mañanas de cuatro estaba sentado un economista llamado Angel Gimeno y me ha parecido uno de los mejores tertulianos que he visto nunca. Incisivo, con autoridad, y sin pelos en la lengua (incluso se ha atrevido a pronunciar Rotschild en TV). Se ha mostrado muy crítico con PPSOE y ha dicho que hay otras alternativas a sus politicas, me pregunto, será de Podemos? Pienso que tendría gran valor que ese hombre formara parte de Podemos: sabe de economia y se desenvuelve extraordinariamente en tertulias, que pensáis? 
2fplrz	-31232	1410088017	podemos	RBU para todos, menos para los internados en centros	Reflexionando sobre la RBU me he preguntado si los ingresados en un centro deben también percibirla, y he llegado a la conclusión de que no. Con ingresados me refiero tanto los que están en un centro penitenciario, como en un centro de deshabituación, psiquiátrico,orfanato,asilo, un hospital etc.Por qué excluirles? Estaremos de acuerdo en que la principal función de la Renta Básica es garantizar la existencia material de los ciudadanos. Sin embargo, los que se encuentran internos en ciertos lugares ya tienen garantizadas su existencia material, puesto que se les da de comer, tienen ropa, un techo...es decir, tienen las necesidades básicas absolutamente cubiertas. No tendría sentido que recibieran la RBU por innecesaria. Por otra parte, en muchos casos no se puede utilizar el dinero de curso legal (como en los centros penitenciarios).Se podría plantear que el ciudadano en cuestión vaya recibiendo la RBU y que la use al abandonar el centro, pero ello puede dar lugar a ingentes acumulaciones de dinero, de entrada parece absurdo. Pensemos por ejemplo en un preso durante 15 años, tendría 108.000 euros para gastar (si la renta es de 600). Qué pensáis? Deben recibir la Renta Básica también?
2fqa8y	-31232	1410108838	podemos	Abusamos de los crowdfunding?	Últimamente observo que se abren campañas de crowdfunding de cantidades irrisorias, que estoy seguro que podrían pagar los organizadores del evento sin tener que pedírselo a la gente.Es cierto que lo que se financia nos beneficia a todos, pero creo que sólo se debería acudir a la gente cuando sea necesario.

Un asistente del público le pregunta sobre los chemtrails y Echenique responde que son nubes y que Cuarto Milenio es un programa de entretenimiento. Se puede estar de acuerdo o no, pero me hubiera gustado que hubiera mostrado más respeto por este tema (que por otra parte hay eurodiputados que lo han denunciado) y no limitarse a hacer ese comentario. Si no está informado que lo diga.Respondiendo de esa forma sólo ha conseguido perder votos de gente que dice Podemos son un producto Illuminati y que por ello ocultan los Chemtrails. Insisto en que el tema no es si existen o no, sino que en mi opinión debería haberse mostrado más ecléctico y respetuoso.
2h58qo	-31232	1411407695	podemos	Dónde está el borrador de Pablo Iglesias?	He visto en varios medios que Iglesias, Errejón y Monedero han subido un borrador donde dicen aue no hay que presentarse a las municipales etc. El caso es que no lo encuentro, dónde está?
2hzb25	-31232	1412161712	podemos	Está mal visto ser de Podemos?	hoy le he comentado a mis amigos de la universidad que era de Podemos.

Qué hemos hecho mal? Parece como si Podemos fuera el partido de los tontos o algo, al menos así me he sentido.

2mrj5t	-31232	1416399086	podemos	El siguiente paso: ataques personales a los economistas de Podemos	El programa económico de Podemos está siendo diseñado por dos economistas brillantes: Vicenç Navarro y Juan Torres. Presiento, y ya he empezado a ver los primeros indicios, de que cuando salga el programa se intentará desprestigiar a dichos economistas por su pasado. La biografía de Juan Torres no la conozco, pero la de Vicenç Navarro sí (lo que pone en wikipedia). Dirán que Vicenç Navarro ha asesorado a Cuba,  a eso hay que responder que únicamente la asesoró en reforma sanitaria (Navarro además de economista y politólogo es médico). Además ha asesorado a Suecia, EEUU, Salvador Allende, la OMS, la ONU... tocará recordarles eso a los antipodemos cuando inventen que ha asesorado a Venezuela o a Corea del Norte. Si habéis oído alguna mentira sobre los economistas compartidla porfavor, vayamos preparando argumentario por si acaso..

2p9x9f	-31232	1418579345	podemos	Podemos se la juega en Grecia?	Como ya sabréis, posiblemente hayan dentro de poco elecciones en Grecia. Según las encuestas, Syriza va a ganar dichas elecciones. Podemos nunca ha escondido su simpatía y sus similitudes con Syriza. Si Syriza gana y hunden la economía eso puede perjudicar gravemente a Podemos.Y aunque Syriza lo haga muy bien, los medios dirán que Grecia va fatal. Qué podemos hacer ante este escenario?
2shzm6	-31232	1421312170	podemos	Charlie Hebdo y el Derecho Penal del Enemigo.	"Derecho penal del Enemigo" o "Feindstrafrecht"  es una expresión acuñada por el jurista alemán  Günther Jakobs para designar una serie de acontecimientos que estaban (y están) ocurriendo en las últimas reformas penales.El Derecho penal del enemigo consiste en dividir a los individuos en dos: ciudadanos y enemigos. A los primeros se les aplica el Derecho penal de toda la vida,  pero a los segundos se les aplica un Derecho penal de combate que se caracteriza por:- adelantamiento de la barrera de punibilidad. Dicho llanamente, se castiga a los enemigos mucho antes que lleguen a hacer algo.- imposición de penas manifiestamente desproporcionales- flexibilización, por no decir eliminación, de los derechos y garantías procesales.Por qué existe el DPE? En realidad siempre han existido cosas parecidas, pero ahora con el terrorismo global el DPE ha encontrado su justificación, su legitimación. Y es que no se considera a los terroristas como ciudadanos, sino como no-personas ("unpersonen"), es decir, enemigos. La legislación antiterrorista de muchos países, en particular España, es claramente DPE. No hablemos ya de otros países como EEUU (Guántamo).Y ahora veo como PP y PSOE van a pactar para darle más terreno al DPE. Se habla de castigar la visita reiterada a páginas web yihadistas (brutal adelantamiento de la punibilidad), entre otras cosas.En Podemos tenemos que estar totalmente en contra del DPE, aunque reste votos. No por nada, sino porque es claramente incompatible con un Estado de Derecho, que se basa en el principio de igualdad y en el de dignidad humana.
2stg2v	-31232	1421571246	podemos	Así creo que debería ser el Programa de Podemos: el Programa Definitivo!	Me gustaría que el programa de Podemos fuera como una obra literaria, que con el paso del tiempo se convierta en un libro de referencia y que se leyera en los colegios.Creo que una vez esté el programa deberían publicarse dos versiones: una abreviada y la completa. En la abreviada simplemente se enumeran las propuestas, pero en la completa se incluiría una justificación, una argumentación para cada propuesta, con datos y si es necesario con imágenes; y que se acompañe de preguntas o críticas frecuentes debidamente contestadas y refutadas respectivamente.Asimismo se debería especificar (quizás a través de un código de colores) si la propuesta es tendencial, a corto, medio o largo plazo (especificando el tiempo en años). En el mismo sentido: http://www.reddit.com/r/podemos/comments/2kvffq/proyectos_no_promesas/Además, hasta un tiempo prudencial antes de las elecciones debería estar abierto a la edición, en el sentido de que se vayan incorporando al programa las aclaraciones que sean necesarias por las malinterpretaciones que seguro surgirán.Incluso se podría buscar el apoyo de expertos en cada materia (economistas, juristas, profesores etc) de prestigio para que firmaren al final de la sección respectiva del programa.Naturalmente todo esto hará que el programa tenga unas dimensiones considerables, así que sería necesario un índice donde apareciera cada propuesta y que se pudiera ir a ésta solo haciendo un click.Lo véis bien? De ser así dadme flechitas para arriba!! Nuestro programa tiene que ser el mejor! 
2tlk62	-31232	1422173387	podemos	Miente Pablo Iglesias al mencionar la Ley de Incompatibilidades?	En la entrevista de ayer a Pablo Iglesias en La Sexta Noche comentó que según el artículo 19 de la Ley de incompatibilidades, el trabajo de profesor universitario es compatible con el asesoramiento a otras entidades, y no se necesita pedir permiso. Pues bien, observando dicho artículo vemos que no se dice nada del asesoramiento: "Quedan exceptuadas del régimen de incompatibilidades de la presente Ley las actividades siguientes:a) Las derivadas de la Administración del patrimonio personal o familiar, sin perjuicio de lo dispuesto en el artículo 12 de la presente Ley.b) La dirección de seminarios o el dictado de cursos o conferencias en Centros oficiales destinados a la formación de funcionarios o profesorado, cuando no tenga carácter permanente o habitual ni supongan más de setenta y cinco horas al año, así como la preparación para el acceso a la función pública en los casos y forma que reglamentariamente se determine.c) La participación en Tribunales calificadores de pruebas selectivas para ingreso en las Administraciones Públicas.d) La participación del personal docente en exámenes, pruebas o evaluaciones distintas de las que habitualmente les correspondan, en la forma reglamentariamente establecida.e) El ejercicio del cargo de Presidente, Vocal o miembro de Juntas rectoras de Mutualidades o Patronatos de Funcionarios, siempre que no sea retribuido.f) La producción y creación literaria, artística, científica y técnica, así como las publicaciones derivadas de aquéllas, siempre que no se originen como consecuencia de una relación de empleo o de prestación de servicios.g) La participación ocasional en coloquios y programas en cualquier medio de comunicación social; yh) La colaboración y la asistencia ocasional a Congresos, seminarios, conferencias o cursos de carácter profesional."Ha mentido, se trata de un error, se refería a otra Ley o se equivocó al decir el artículo? qué pensáis?

1x4sl0	-31233	1391645828	leagueoflegends	Improved friend/foe differentiation	So a lot of times, it happened to me that in battle as a marksman, some enemy champion is flanking, and because I don't see life bar color (or I should say it's off my screen for that moment - I can see only champion model approaching) I can't decide if I should run, or just stay cuz it's friendly champion as a backup. If I move the camera towards him, it would take away fight screen, just enough that I screw over micro mechanics, possibly resulting in death. This could be vise versa - the friendly jungler (or mid) is coming (and for some reason hasn't used pings), but when I see his only his model entering the fight frame, I might decide to run instead of commiting even more. This happens rather rarely, but when it does it's really annoying. It doesn't occur after first or second gank/dragon fight, cuz you get used to what team comp you're using, but a lot can be decided before that by being in position to misjudge like in foremention examples. So for the sake of micro managing champions, I'd suggest implementing the option to add tiles below friendly/enemy champions - let's say green for an ally champions, and red for enemy ones. Although i'm not playing on locked camera, I'd say that this would be huge help for players using it. Thoughts?Edit1: I can see this messing with cho gath-ult-finish off-indication, but I wouldn't think this couldn't be avoided somehow. English is not my mother tongue, no copy pasterino :D

2otd4g	-31233	1418173567	leagueoflegends	Proposed tweaks to Tristana's spells	Hello Reddit,As Tristana main since S2, I'm really looking forward to Tristana's changes in the following patches, but I wanted to post my suggestions to make her more viable, and not so clunky anymore. So here's my idea:  - Her E (Explosive Shot) now gets called Explosive Shots, and it doesn't have active. It rather becomes toggle ability and when it's on it triggers current passive. So much like Jinx Rocket Launcher, except that this cannot crit and is magic damage. Currently, her E active is some kind of trading tool with clunky passive, but with no AD scaling and nerfed base damage in some of the previous patches, it's just not that great (or great at all, which can be seen with her pick rate post worlds/nerf patches). This way she gets some pushing power in the laning phase, better usage of her mana pool, and some poke if opposing ADC or Support decide (or get forced to) stand close to the minions. - Also, I'd suggest changes to her ultimate (Buster Shot). So it would be called the same, except that force field which is used for knockback now extends to the whole distance. It wouldn't knockback other champions (like Lee Sin's Dragon Rage) rather does damage to all people standing in that 200 radius of champion travel route while knockbacked. Explanation: Tristana can cast abilites while mid-air. With this tweak, she would be able to catch fleeing enemies by jumping in front of the target that is blocking further skillshots on the low-health target, cast R on it, get the reset, and jump out. I've just came up with another usage - champions that can line up enemies, like Braum or Rumble.It won't be easy, so let's make Tristana not right-click-only-based-type-of-marksman/markswoman/marksyordle. :DPost your comments below, I'd really like my favourite champion to be viable again, was waiting for it almost two years, and when she finally did, it lasted only a few months before and during worlds.Link for my account: http://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=invincible+champ

32lz1m	-31233	1429046421	leagueoflegends	Riot, please make it so that post match lobby can be skipped by ticking a certain option	As Riot Lyte said, 90% of the LoL player base is toxic, and until it changes dramatically, we should avoid getting harassed as much as possible. After each game, and I'm talking about ranked, the toxicity is spilling over to the post match lobby. I'd like to be able to skip it, especially because it's useless talk, except the instant visibility of LP change, but that's one click away on profile. Or make it so that you can't receive messages from muted people, that's even more simple, I don't even know why it's possible at the first place.

Too many times I've played a game and sent a friend request to someone, but he went offline right after the game. Heck, some even wouldn't show up online for days, so that when he accepts my request, I wouldn't know what was his name nor why he is on my friend list, and that's like only if I could recognize he's new. One small notification would when logging in would resolve most of these misteries. Furthermore, maybe a list of pending requests where we could browse their profiles, much like 'recently played tab'. Forever grateful, LoL player since S2.

33tpl4	-31233	1429975010	leagueoflegends	Dear Riot, does taking inhib down needs to be an auto-win objective?	Both in competitive scene and solo queue (at least in plat+), statistics say that whoever gets the opponent inhibitor first, wins the game. So can we tune down the power of super creeps? Maybe just revert the change of the inhibitor respawn time? It puts so much pressure for too much time and just by stalling, someone has to get back to wave clear, that turns into 4v5 baron contest and we all know how it always ends. TLDR: There is no reason to keep playing/watching a competitive game when the first inhibitor goes down, the winner is already decided.

Would you have liked if there wasn't so many of those games? Fear not, I got a proposal. I suggest that for first 10-15 minutes (which is usually the time where you impact your score the most by yourself), we all get a performance rating, much like post game grade. We wouldn't be able to see it, but it would get into consideration to MMR change post game. I won't get into details, I just want to see what you others think, just gonna say that this thing would take into consideration all the things that current post game grade does: Kills, Deaths, Assists, Minion score, Damage Dealt, Damage Tanked, Jungle monsters slain etc.

I am from British Columbia, Canada. However, one of my most major gripes about Marijuana culture is that many people think that it has no negative effects on one's health. there is a common misconception that Marijuana is good for you or that there is no medical proof that Marijuana can harm a healthy person. I believe this misconception is linked to the idea that Marijuana can be used medicinally. I believe that if people are going to continue to smoke Marijuana (they will) they should be informed by science of the dangers that one inherantly faces when smoking Marijuana recreationally. please upvote if you believe in science and not just blindly listening to what hippies tell you about how natural herbs are good for you. just remember people before people started getting lung-cancer from smoking tobacco and corporatoins added addictive chemicals the people of North America considered tobacco to be a sacred herb as well. keep an open mind reddit. here is a link to a medical journal that's study shows marijuana to be as cancer causing as tobacco or more so. http://www.ersj.org.uk/content/31/2/280.full

I have always noticed a pretty strong disparity in quality. However, some players can effectivlely use the CFL as a starting point for the to enter the NFL. Do pro scouts watch much CFL? The salary cap is somewhere around 5 million loonies per team which even with a poor exchange rate puts it ahead of arena football.  Do any Americans even watch? writing this post made me realize that Ndomicon Suh makes more money than 3.8 CFL rosters every season.

I will start:My brother was once at a game at the Rog and he heard a member of Tanev's family (aunt or grandma) calling him Butch. Another slightly less credible story...I was at a game one time and the guys sitting behind me kept yelling "sweetbreads" any time Higgins touched the puck. I have called Higgins sweetbreads ever since because I think it is an unreal nickname. I know this could easily be some kind of inside joke between two drunk dudes but I just had to know if it wasn't. So does anyone have any insight? Also do you know any other lesser known Canucks nicknames?

Hear me out.Ever scince I finished ADWD and discovered the ever so prevalent R+L=J theory, I've been wondering how exactly GRRM will handle the big reveal in the books. Who will tell Jon of his parentage?  Will Jon even be the 1st to find out? Will we ever get concrete proof of R+L=J? Or will we simply have Howland Reed crannoging around Westeros, trying to spread the Jon Starkgaryen gospel from Dorne to the Wall?What are your favourite theories? I think I'd prefer Bran to find out through tree warging,  eavesdropping on Ned (or maybe even Lyanna) talking in a confession like fashion to the weirwood. That way we get to see Ned talking about Jon as his nephew, instead of his bastard.Sorry if I broke reddiquette, I'm new around here.

I was reading The Hedge Knight and I came upon the name Androw. **Androw**I guess Andrew was just too mainstream.On a similar note, I saw the name Aemon pop up in The Wheel of Time series, which indicates that it's probably not a name the GRRM just made up.Which leads to the question:Is there a cache of ridiculous fantasy names out there, or is the GRRM just pulling these out of his ass?

In general, they should be sent out within two to four weeks of receiving a present.  Since it can be a little overwhelming to write all of the cards in one sitting, try to write them as you receive each gift.  It's easier said than done, but it really does help.  It's becoming more common for friends and relatives to mail physical gifts to the bride and groom's house before the wedding, but cash and checks are still typically given in cards at the wedding itself.  Since we already had our guest list with addresses typed up, we just printed it off as a list and filled in presents that we received off to the side of each family.  If you have a shower, you can ask one of your bridesmaids to keep track of who gave what while you're busy opening presents.  Sometimes a guest will get you a gift for both your shower and the wedding; in this case, it's usually appropriate to send two separate notes.   For us, the format of the card was the difficult part.  I wanted each card to be personalized, but it was a little hard when I was only meeting some of his extended family for the first time at the wedding.  Not to mention, at some point you may be sitting down with fifty cards to write and being super creative gets a little more difficult.  I ended up finding a guide called [Sample Wording for Wedding Thank You Cards](http://weddings.about.com/od/bridesandgrooms/a/thankyoucards.htm), which we used as a starting off point.   Always start the note by addressing each gifter by name.  Thank them for the gift or gifts, and be specific (unless it's cash or a check).  For money, just thank them for their generous gift.  Follow up by mentioning something you'll be using the gift for - "We're so excited to finally be able to lay out a matching silverware set for dinner," or "Thanks to your generous gift, we were finally able to purchase the new vacuum we've had our eyes on".  No matter how big or small the gift was, it's generous - nobody has to get you anything!   Close the note by mentioning the past and the future.  For example, you can say how happy you were to see them at the wedding or how you were sorry they couldn't make it, and mention how you can't wait to see them at the next family get-together.  We signed most of our family notes with Love, and the others with Best wishes and Regards.   Just remember to have fun with it!  We were actually going to dress up and do a silly photo shoot of us using each gift to put in the cards - think [I Love Lucy style](http://tvland.mtvnimages.com/images/shows/i_love_lucy/photos/I-Love-Lucy-Fake-Nose.jpg) - but we ran out of time after the honeymoon.  I know writing them isn't the most exciting part of a wedding, but hopefully this will make it a little easier.

1op4oj	-31259	1382072924	weddingplanning	r/weddingplanning is looking to add mods!	As many of you know, the amount of spam in our subreddit has increased in recent weeks, prompting changes such as increasing the sensitivity of the spam filter and increasing the number of bans handed out for spamming.  With that said, we're currently looking to add one or two new mods to this subreddit. Primary responsibilities will be going through the spam filter to approve or remove links, banning spammers, responding to questions, and helping with maintenance and improvements to r/weddingplanning (ex. weekly themed posts, wiki creation). The new mod(s) must be able to help with these tasks frequently and for a reasonable length of time. We would prefer people who are active contributors to this subreddit. Nocturnal or non-US redditors would be a plus (to help with late night spam) but this isn't required. Please use the button on the right side of your screen to message the mods to indicate interest in becoming a mod. Thanks for your time!
1osir1	-31259	1382210589	weddingplanning	Introducing our new mods!	Let me start by saying thank you to everyone who expressed interest in helping Emma and myself mod r/weddingplanning.  As this subreddit continues to grow, it's wonderful to see how many people care about it and are willing to take time out of their days to make it a better experience for everyone.  With that said, I'd like to introduce our three newest mods: **/u/dreadpiraterose**: "Philly bride here with two weeks left to go before her big day (?!$%)! I'm also a part time wedding photographer who's seen a LOT of different weddings at this point. Glad to be helping out a great reddit wedding community!" **/u/bravetostadora**: "Hey everyone! I'm very happy to be joining the mod team here at r/weddingplanning! This is my first time modding, so hopefully I'll catch on quick! I'll be getting married on October 11, 2014 down here in New Orleans and I can't wait to help out the community that's been helping me plan my wedding!" **/u/hatstretcher**: "I'm Ellis, I'm 28 from Oregon and have been engaged now for 9 months. We decided on a long engagement to help spread the cost thinly over a year and a half to alleviate stress and to make sure we gave all our out-of-state guests time to plan. I'm excited to be a mod because this sub has helped with so many issues and ideas through the process." These three will be helping to reduce the spam, respond to questions, and some of the behind the scenes work like managing weekly threads and getting the wiki going.  Thanks and welcome!

Harry made a 1/10 mm spider web that he turned into braided carbon nanotubes and quartered their previous size, so they are 25 microns thick. How much force would you need to cut someones neck with a loop of those nanotubes? (don't forget wizards are stronger then muggles).

1k65bq	-31280	1376262083	legaladvice	My ex has a new boyfriend living at her home with her and my 8 and 5 year old children. I'd like his name so that I can run a simple background check on him. She is refusing. Do I have a legal right to know? Round Rock, Texas	Update: Thank you for all for your advice. After reading all of it, I have contacted a lawyer who has confirmed that, yes, I absolutely have the right to know who is spending time with my children. We are taking the cautious and non-threatening route at first. We will write a letter urging my ex to provide the info, and will only proceed to a divorce decree amendment (requiring her to provide the info) if that doesn't work. Thank you, all, for your advice and help.Last Update: I contacted a lawyer, told her my situation, and she agreed that I had a right to know his name. So, she charged me $75 to write a letter on my behalf, and in the interest of my two children, to my ex. It said that I have a right to know, and I was willing to go to court to get the information, and she would have to pay the court costs if it happened that way. Per my directions, the letter emphasized that I was not trying to control who my ex dated, but was only interested in knowing who was spending time with my children. My ex sent me a text with her boyfriend's last name today. Did the usual google search, and that came back with good information. Did the sex offender search with no results, which is good. So, I texted her back and said thank you and that I was satisfied. Done deal. He's a good guy. Issue closed. Thank y'all for all the helpful and informative comments. Have a good one. :)
1nlwet	-31280	1380746986	Enhancement	[feature request] "Top of Page" icon alongside the mail and pause buttons that stay on the page while scrolling.	The mail and pause button stay at the top right corner of the page while scrolling. Could you add a third button that, when clicked, takes me back to the top of the page? Maybe I'm just missing something, but after scrolling for many pages, and deciding to switch subreddits, I have to manually scroll up, which can be a pain if I'm many pages down, or I have to just re-enter the reddit.com domain in the URL box, which is annoying. It seems like a good idea that RES would allow me to scroll through many pages, but also make it a snap to get back to the top. Thanks for considering it.
1oxaoh	-31280	1382385579	AskReddit	A Friend of mine is running for District Court Judge. On his campaign web site, he states he is a "Qualified and experienced conservative Republican".

1p6lbw	-31280	1382690898	AskReddit	Why does the procedure that is used for making laws allow for the inclusion of "Riders"? (I mean the other stuff that is attached to the proposed law that becomes law if the bill it is attached to becomes law) How did that become an acceptable practice, and could we end it now without problems?	Because: Those "riders" seem to allways be controversial, unlikely to pass on their own merits, extremely greedy funding requests that benefit one state only, or just plain old PORK. 
28q3o1	-31280	1403362886	explainlikeimfive	ELI5: How does computer software "hand off" a problem to a different part of itself?	To my understanding, software written in object oriented programming languages can pass problems along to other parts of a themselves. Before these types of languages were invented, programs worked linearly, so the whole program ran in sequence, basically, but now a program can move data from one part of itself to another, to parts of the programs that handle certain situations appropriately, but in my mind, I can not understand how a string of numbers can "move data" to the correct place without running the program in it's entirety.

23pj1k	-31283	1398198484	NoFap	7 years	I remember the first day, i was 10 years old or so, and i just got around to watching porn on a daily basis but soft porn, like in the late night movies you see on the tv or some 5 mins vids i would find in the internet. After some of these, i noticed how a guy was masturbating to a girl, and i decided to try the same movement but with my dick, it was one of my happiest moments ever, but since then, it got so much worse.For 7 years now(im turning 18 soon) i have been fapping everyday and  i feel ashamed and really awful about it, i tried stopping a lot of times, 3 days, then i would slip, 7 days and the boners wouldnt stop, i even got to 14 days which is my record but i cant take it anymore, masturbating is my biggest addiction, as big as smoking or drinking for other people, i need help or some advice from you people, because as i am writting this i just failed to even get 7 days again without fapping.

So today I played my first 3v3 on my smurf (moved from europe to japan so I can't properly play on the EUW server), and I have a good MMR in 5v5, with 100 wins for 70 losses, so I am always playing with smurfs. I thought it would be the same in 3v3 but I actually end up playing against first accounts. It feels a bit unfair to me, both for me because of the lack of challenge and for them for the hard games.

I find it especially difficult to play adc or support which are my 2 favorite roles because of all the rage.So I am looking for a duo queue partner, whatever ELO, to play botlane with. I can help you learning and let's have a good time playing. My IGN is "Nightcore Japan" on NA.

2coifp	-31316	1407239486	CHIBears	Clavicle injury return time research	For those keen to know how soon Marquess MAY be back, I did a bit of research. Guy was playing awesome in preseason so I hope he's back as quick as Colston did it (3 weeks). Longest recoveries were Woodson who was 36, had previously injured his clavicle, and Cooper who needed surgery and a plate installed. If Marques doesn't need surgery I'd be surprised if he was out for more than 6 weeks going by the history here...**Marques Colston** WR 2011 - **3 weeks**, came back and only had 1 catch for 8 yards in first game but had a good season after that. **Danny Amendola** WR 2012 - **5 weeks**, came back and had a 100 yard game vs San Francisco**Charles Woodson** S 2012 - **11 weeks**, came back for 1st week of playoffs - I'm guessing they were saving him for the playoffs and were extra cautious as he broke his collarbone in 2011 too. Woodson was 36 years old so that may have something to do with the longer recovery - also plays safety much rougher than WR.**Riley Cooper** WR 2012 - approx **10 weeks**, injured a week before first preseason game and back for game 6. This one required surgery and a steel plate fixed. **Ryan Matthews** RB 2012 - **6 weeks**, came back and played 11 games and injured it again in the 12th. **Randy Orton** 2008 - **4 months**, Triple H, who was countering Orton's patented RKO maneuver, threw Orton over the ropes and onto the unforgiving floor, where he broke his collarbone. Orton would be out for months after the injury, but got his revenge on January 25, 2009, when he successfully eliminated Triple H at the Royal Rumble.

I made a spearmen (because they are one of the highest dps now) and a Wild Hunter (unique, mobile, and decent at bossing) so what should I buy them? My friend told me that att work gloves aren't even a thing anymore so what is?

24udy2	-31322	1399356317	Maplestory	What class to make?	The things i look for in a class is high dps, good mobbing, and high mobility. I had a kaiser, and it's damage was great, I just felt so slow and restricted with how small the AoE attacks were. I made a wild hunter and I love it, it's probably going to be my main but I wanted to have like 2nd most used class just to make sure I don't get bored. So I wanted someone who is good at bossing, has big mobbing attacks, and is mobile. So far it's down to dual bladers or Shadower, in the dps charts though it said that DBs are bad at bossing, but also that shadowers are really hard to train until high levels. Which one should I pick? Is there another class that fits my description better than those two?

Freakishly similar.I've even seen some women on here admitting that they cheated on their husband/boyfried. So my question is this... Do you think the increase of stories on here about women cheating is just a coincidence in that more men may seek out help on a forum than women? Or perhaps the increase of infidelity on the woman may have something to do with the crap they watch on TV. Keeping up with the kardashians, real housewives, I am CAIT for goodness sakes. These "reality" TV shows are poisioning our women's minds. It's like these shows are condoning this type of behavior. Women, if you disagree or have some insight, please share.

xi7f0	-31350	1343829216	atheism	The Parable of the Man and the Rocks	Hey guys, I am a bit new to this sub and these ideas in general. I have been listening to a lot of Richard Dawkins, Lawrence Krauss, and Christopher Hitchens lately and a lot of it is making a lot of sense to me. Anyways, I've realized that religion often uses simple parables to explain "complicated" things to people, so I have decided to write my own:The Parable of the Man and the RocksThere was a once a great city ruled by a powerful wizard from a tower in the middle of the city. Noone ever saw the wizard, but luckily, many years ago he gave rules and truths to his friends, who were kind enough to record these great teachings in an ancient book. One of these teachings was that 2+2=9. Everyone knew this simple truth, it had been passes down for generations. Occasionally someone would have the balls to question it, but they were quickly banished or beheaded to keep them from confusing the loyal citizens of the city.One day, a man was playing with some rocks in a field. He collected 2 sets of 2 rocks, and pushed them together. Upon counting them, he was astonished to find that they did not add up to 9. He counted them many times, and even tried some other rocks, but alas, it always seemed to come out as 4. Excited by his discovery, he took his findings to the Arch-Mage, who supposedly received direct instructions from the grand wizard through his pointy hat. The Arch-Mage was furious with the man, claiming his 2+2=4 theory to be blasphemy. 2+2 clearly equals 9... It says so in the ancient book, and therefore it must be true. Some time passed, and other people learned of this ludicrous 2+2=4 theory. Although the Arch-Mage and his followers did what they could to keep the city pure by burning and hanging as many blasphemers as possible, eventually enough people and enough evidence was gathered that the followers of the wizard realized that this theory was indeed true.After some debate, and thankfully a secret message to the arch-Mage from the wizard, they concluded that the 2+2=9 teaching was obviously a parable to explain the meaning of math to people a long time ago. It wasn't meant to be taken literally today.  But it doesn't matter, because there is no way that the man could prove that another great teaching of the wizard, 100+100=369, wasnt true.The man and his colleagues continued their rock counting in hopes of furthering their knowledge and understanding. Eventually, enough rocks were gathered to show that actually, 100+100=200. After much debate, executions, and more secret wizard messages, it was concluded that 369 must be the wizard's version of 200. Who are we to know what number system the wizard uses? Besides, noone can prove that 1000+1000 doesn't equal 7652, for it is stated clearly in the ancient book. After much rock collecting and careful counting, the man later found that 1000+1000 definitely equals 2000, not 7652 as previously stated in the book by the wizard. Blasphemy! Again, after much consideration, recounting, and secret wizard messages, it was realized that this only proves how clever and powerful the wizard is, for he created and counted so many rocks!  Besides, no one can prove that 1,000,000+1,000,000 doesn't equal 8383981. The man wasn't sure... Based on his previous counting he thought that it was unlikely, but continued with his rocks to prove it.After many more days of rock counting, the man returned with his newest discovery: 1000000+1000000=2000000! The arch-Mage simply stated that he didn't know how to count that high so he found the data unconvincing. Besides, noone can prove that 10,000,000+10,000,000 doesn't equal....

yyuet	-31350	1346170954	DebateReligion	So about original sin...	Christianity is based on the idea that we are born with original sin, and Jesus had to die and resurrect himself to absolve this sin. Original sin was created by Adam and Eve in the garden when they ate the forbidden fruit and were thrown out.  So answer me this:Evolution disproves the Adam and Eve creation story. Without that story, where does original sin come from?  If you are an evolution believing Christian, how do you believe in both if the science shakes the base of the religion?If you are a Christian that doesn't believe in evolution, how can you justify this belief against the overwhelming amount of evidence that the theory is a fact?Either way, why couldn't an all powerful , all knowing, all LOVING God figure out a better way to forgive his children for eating an apple than waiting thousands of years and then torturing and killing his own son?Christianity teaches to forgive others for there sins against us, regardless of how terrible they may be. We are encouraged to forgive our sibling's murderer or our child's rapist. But God banished his chosen race to the world were they suffered for thousands of years for eating an apple? And we yell at parents for spanking children...
z0qi7	-31350	1346249475	DebateReligion	Is Religion the root of Morality?	A common pro-religion argument is that morality is evidence for the existence of God. Religious people, especially Christians, state that without the guidance of the Bible/God, we would have no sense of good and evil or right from wrong.I would like to argue, however, that it is amazing that we have developed our current social morality in spite of religion. In spite of the Bible, we know that slavery, genocide, and rape are wrong. In spite of the Bible, we realize that races should be treated as equals, woman should have the same rights as men, and people of other religions and belief systems deserve the right to practice and believe as they wish. We realize that people don't deserved to be put to death for being gay, working on the sabbath, or disobeying their parents.The evolutionary perspective states that morality evolved in society because it gave us the best chance of survival. Sticking together and protecting each other helps the species as a whole. Being kind and doing favors for people makes them more likely to return the favor. The Jews didn't run around murdering and stealing from each other before the 10 commandments were given to them. They didn't all of the sudden say holy shit, now we know murder is bad! Sorry bro!Atheists and other non Christians don't run around killing people because they have no moral compass. We don't need some all powerful being to tell us what's right and what's wrong, it cheapens our species by saying we can't figure it out ourselves. And we definitely don't need religious people to cherry pick what sounds good to them out of their religious texts and throw it at the rest of us.
z2q0o	-31350	1346332301	DebateReligion	Do you require evidence for Jesus? Or is it a question of faith?	An argument I have heard several times from William Lane Craig is something like this: biblical historians believe that Jesus existed, and that he died and resurrected, because of the reaction of his followers. Many early Christians preached their beliefs against the laws of Rome and were put to death for it. Basically the argument is, people wouldn't have sacrificed their own lives for something they didn't completely believe, and since these people are supposed witnesses to the resurrected Christ, then it must have happened.I don't want to get into refuting this too much, I will simply say that primitive and uneducated people are easily influenced, deceived, and manipulated and I don't see this as valid evidence personally, but that's not quite what I want to ask.For Christians (or members or other religions from their point of view):1. Do you feel the need to have evidence or "proof" that Jesus lived, or more importantly (and harder to prove) performed various miracles and rose from the dead? Or do you simply accept this through faith?2. If you take it on faith, why? Are there other things in life that you simply accept as true with no evidence to support it?3. If you search for evidence and view my opening as evidence of Christianity being correct, how do you disregard other religions? I can use the exact same argument to "prove" that Islam or any other religion, for which people have sacrificed or devoted their lives to, is the true religion.4. Is there any other supposed evidence that you subscribe to to prove Christianity (or your respective religion)?
ze2k8	-31350	1346849640	DebateReligion	Is it Scary how easily people believe in the Supernatural?	When I first started researching religion and questioning my faith, I was initially kind of shocked to hear atheists like Christopher Hitchens refer to God/Jesus etc as "supernatural".  To me, supernatural was ghosts, vampires, unicorns etc. it didn't feel right to label God as such. But the truth is, real or not, gods, angels, and their claimed extraordinary acts fall under the supernatural category. Then I thought about how silly it was for most people to believe in other supernatural things. Few educated people truly believe in ghosts, big foot, or the loch ness monster... They may be fun to speculate and hold a bit of hope for, but it is widely viewed that these arnt real. It if act considered ridiculous or crazy if one strongly believes in these types of things.So I wonder why it is so accepted and encouraged to believe, unquestioningly and completely, in a supernatural entity such as God? Many of the claims about god are far more extreme an unrealistic sounding than other supernatural creatures. We have claimed eye witness accounts for big foot, ghosts, ufos, loch ness. These accounts are only 0 to 100 years old, yet they are disregarded as lies and mistakes because there just isnt enough evidence. We even have supposed videos and photos of all of these things from different people all over the world.  This is all disregarded, often without a thought, by most people. Many of the same people readily accept a much more fantastical supernatural being, with the newest eye witness accounts being 2000 years old and no other evidence of his existence, completely and without a doubt.Does this not seem a little crazy to you? My thoughts as to why this is so are 2-fold:1. Integration in society. Many people are literally brain washed into this belief. I know because I accepted it for 20+ years without a question myself. We are exposed to church and religion from infancy, told how horrible the punishments of not believing and following can be, and discouraged and looked down upon by society for questioning these beliefs or expressing different ones.2. Fear. We are afraid of turning against society. We are afraid of tuning against our family and friends. We are afraid of asking questions and looking for real evidence. We are afraid to doubt or question god for fear of eternal punishment. And we are afraid that death is truly the end and have trouble accepting that. Don't be afraid.So what are everyone's thoughts on this subject?
107gpu	-31350	1348168701	DebateReligion	To Christians: Questions about sin, punishment, and forgiveness.	I have a few questions regarding sin, punishment, law, forgiveness, etc. these are in no specific order or anything, just some stuff to talk about. 1. Christians are generally concerned with creating/maintaining laws that go with their beliefs (gay marriage, abortion for example). If we have free will, shouldn't we have the choice to "sin" with something like gay marriage? If there is a law against it, is that not restricting free will? Can't things like this be handled in the church and by god rather than our judicial system? 2. Why does God call for harsh punishments on earth for sins (stoning for working on the sabbath, stoning for displaying parents, etc.) when he plans to punish them for their sins after death? Shouldn't hell be much worse anyway?3. Often when bringing up the crazy rules and crimes in the old testament like I mentioned in 2, along with no shellfish, slavery being ok, rules about rape, etc etc, the argument is "well time were different then, that was acceptable in society..." if god is beyond time and space, all loving all knowing etc, shouldn't his laws be independent of time and place? Surely god knew that slavery and rape and killing for petty crimes was wrong 4000 years ago, how is it moral to permit those things knowing them to be evil?4.  Jesus is a scapegoat for our sins. He died so that we could be saved, right? If we follow him our sins are forgiven. Why are you ok with this scapegoat principle? Should person A be able to take the sins of person B? For example, should I be able to sacrifice and go to jail for the crimes of another? How is punishing someone innocent salvation for the guilty?5. Why does God need the elaborate plan of killing his son I absolve our sins? If he is all powerful, couldn't he just... Forgive the sins? On another note, if he planned everything, he planned or that to happen from the beginning... Why not start with a better plan?6. On a similar note, how does the idea of God being the great designer, designing everything and knowing who will do what, right or wrong, at what time, leading to everything that the world was, is, or will be... All according to his plan... Fit with the idea of free will? For the world to be the way it is today, supposedly as god planned it, people had to sin. Hitler had to do what he did for the world to be the way it is today. Was it designed to happen? Was hitler designed from conception to be evil? If so, was he doomed from the start to sin and go to hell? Did he have free will to not do the things he did?  It is either Devine design OR free will, it can't be both.That's all for now may add some more later, thanks.

12t1f0	-31350	1352309490	Android	I can't decide. Help me pick a phone!	Hey all. I have been trying to decide on my next phone for about 2 months. I change my mind multiple times a day... decided to come beg for help!Here is the situation. I am on a family plan that I will stay on. Contract is up December 1st. I currently have an iphone4, which i like but find boring and I am leaning towards trying android again (had an HTC hero a few years ago).So originally the choice was iphone5 or galaxy s3. I found the iPhone boring, but it seems to be spanking the s3 in most benchmarks (especially web browsing stuff). Now I have also tossed the Optimus G and Nexus 4 into the mix. I think the Nexus 4 looks amazing. It has top of the market specs and I love the idea of getting 4.2 now and Having the latest release always. The problem is... I am having trouble justifying it @350$ when I could get all of the other ones at 200$ when I renew. The optimus g also looks nice in the spec department obviously, but I have been reading bad things about LG's android OS skin and their lack of support for updates. So my basic questions boil down to: Is the Nexus 4 worth 150$ more than the other phones? Is LG that bad software-wise? Would you take an s3 over an Optimus g? Could I get an Optimus g or s3 and root it to get android 4.2 easily?Btw: I am on at&amp;t and no LTE in my area so that isn't a big factor. 
12vekn	-31350	1352403570	halo	BR vs DMR vs LR	So which do you guys like the best? Overall, I think I've done the best with DMR. I can shoot it faster at close to mid range when bloom isn't much of an issue, and still effective long range if bloom is timed correctly. The BR seems easier to use but slightly weaker when both are used correctly.As for the LR, it may be the best of the 3 when scoped... Basically a DMR without bloom. But I seem to do worse with it unscoped, not sure why. Has anyone checked the kill speeds of all of these? I actually havent put a ton of effort into counting, but they seem to all be 4 shot kills? What do you guys think?
132w20	-31350	1352751780	AndroidQuestions	LG Optimus G vs HTC One X+	Hey all, I am up for an upgrade Dec 1 and have decided to jump ship back to Android from my iPhone 4. I have Done quite a bit of research and played a bit in the AT&amp;T store and have pretty much settled on the LG OG or possibly waiting on the One X+.I was considering the Nexus 4, but I can get phones with contract renewal for 199$, plus my area is getting LTE sometime in the next few months.  I was also considering the Galaxy S3, but from playing around in the store, the Optimus G seemed better to me. So what do you guys think about these phones? What android phone would you get on AT&amp;T with LTE? I love the Optimus G's top notch specs and the phone looked and felt great. I have heard some questionable things about LG reception, as well as their general lack of support/updates which worries me. They say 4.1 will happen soon but I know I'll be pissed if it doesn't. Plus, the boot loader is locked so it's harder to play with.I really like the design of the one X+, and spec wise it doesn't seem too off of the Optimus, though some reviews have said that while the over clocked tegra3 can put out similar benchmark numbers, it gets hot, has worse battery, and overall isnt as good of a chipset as the new snapdragon quad in the Optimus and nexus4. I have also heard a lot of negativity about the sense ui, although I am excited that it is already running Jellybean. Does anyone know about the boot loader or how hard it is to root a one x+?Also not having a release date is a bummer, I could wait a few weeks but I don't want to be in the dark for too long. Anyways, I am just looking for general opinions/experiences here, thanks for the help. 
136hpv	-31350	1352900559	AndroidQuestions	How serious of a problem is a locked boot loader?	I am considering getting an Optimus G, but am a bit turned off by the locked boot loader. I would really like to run CM 10 on it. Googling around, there doesn't seem to be a reliable unlock for   AT&amp;T yet. I am new to android and had a few questions:1. Is it reasonable to assume that an unlock for the boot loader is simply a matter of time and will be out soon?2. How dangerous is it to unlock it and put CM10 on compared to something unlocked like a galaxy S3?3. It sounds like with an S3, if I had issues I could flash back the stock ROM and AT&amp;T wouldn't be able to tell I modded for warrantee stuff. How is it with a cracked boot loader? Can I take it back to stock if necessary or once it's cracked am I def off warrantee?4. There is obviously a ton of community support for the s3, how long (if ever) would you expect it to take for the Optimus to have a solid community with custom ROMs, etc?Thanks!
136ll3	-31350	1352905634	AndroidQuestions	Quad core vs Dual core: when does it matter?	I am trying to figure out when the quad core is better than a dual core. I know in PCs, there are a lot of applications that do not use more than 4 cores (or even more than 2). This means that a quad core isn't outclassed by a 6 in these situations... A quad will even beat a 6 in these situations if it's clocked faster.Anyway, my question is, if I go for a quad core, during what phone activities will it matter? Is it just in graphically intensive games, loading videos, or heavy stuff like that? Or does it noticeably increase performance in everything including menu navigation, screen transitions, etc? How does it effect web browsing? Mainly comparing s3 dual core to Optimus quad if that matters.On a related note, would a quad core or more ram be better for general performance? (for example, one x+ has quad core but 1gb ram while s3 is dual core with 2gb)Thanks.

Feels like driving on ice compared to AWD. I think the biggest issue is launch. I cannot get a launch that rivals any AWD.

I seem to almost always be towards the back. Top 2 or 3 spots is a huge advantage IMO, especially if you get off the line well and can get some space from the pack so you don't get T-boned into walls in the first few corners by the plethora of people in this game that don't seem to ever use their breaks....

I also realize losses happen and sometimes it's unavoidable. However, I keep getting into games where I am doing well and 1or 2 other lanes just feed so horribly, so quickly, that there is nothing I can do. For example, last night I'm in a game on Ezreal. We are winning bot at 10 min despite no jungle support. I'm 3-1 with good farm. At this time, mid is 0-4 and jungler is 0-5. You can't really come back from that. I have tried to improve my communication with people having bad games, be supportive, offer advice etc... But there is only so much I can do. Basically, every time I win a few games in a row, I seem to be thrown teams with someone horrible enough to die 4-5+ times before 10-15 min.Do I need to exclusively play mid/jungle and try to babysit for these people? What champs should I be focusing on to carry at this ELO? How do you react to someone that rappidly dies several times at the start of a game to try to salvage the game?Any advice is appreciated.
1ittaa	-31350	1374517669	fantasyfootball	Help me pick my pick in Snake	Hi all, So the way my league does pick order, is that we get to pick what pick we want based on final standings from the previous year. So I was 4th, and the picks off the board are 1, 2, and 8.I want to go RB RB RB. My first instinct was take pick 3 and grab Rice or Lynch (thoughts on who's better)? And then at picks 18/22 grab forte, mjd, cj2k, McFadden... However, I'm also considering dropping as far back as pick 6 or so, mainly because I'm not convinced Lynch and rRice are that much better of picks than Martin and Charles... I feel like both those guys are risky but have huge upside.Final thought would be to take pick 9 or 10 and guarantee to good backs (pick 2 from the Spiller, Morris, Richardson, McCoy, SJ group).10 team league with standard ESPN rules. So what would you do and why?

1wcnhi	-31350	1390887768	askseddit	Facebook game? A unique surprise.	So I had an unexpected (but pleasant) surprise the other day. I walked by a girl that I attempted to hit on (poorly) about 2 years ago. She informed me she had a boyfriend, was nice but it didn't go anywhere. I have come a long way skill-wise since then.Fast forward to a few days ago, I walked by her in a public place, glance at her, don't speak or anything. The next day I had a Facebook friend request from her. She knows my sister casually through her job, so I assume she remembered me and could track me down because of that. A little innocent  facebook stalking seemed to indicate that she split from her BF a while ago.So anyway, I was pleasantly surprised by the whole thing. It seems to me she wouldn't randomly friend me if she wasn't interested... But this is a bit of a unique situation and I have very little Facebook game experience. So here I am. We are both mid 20s with good jobs in the same area, and she seems pretty classy/smart. My only way to contact her is probably via Facebook. Any ideas, tips, or strategies for me on my next move? Any help is appreciated!

I love the thing on back roads, but I'm starting to get a bit tired of the sacrifices I have to make on my daily commute and other day to day activities. Complicating that, I know my gf (and soon to be fiancé, hopefully) is often uncomfortable riding in such a sporty, stiff car on the crap roads we have around town. Also, we have been going on a lot of road trips (her family lives a few hours away, both of us have friends in other cities, etc) and the FRS just isn't a practical road trip car for us, her dog, and all of our stuff.So I've been trying to find the most practical, somewhat comfortable car possible that still has enough fun and sportiness to make me grin when I'm driving spiritedly around on backroads. Before the FRS, I had a 2012 GLI that checked a lot of boxes for me... But was an automatic and the cost cutting in this generation of Jetta interiors annoyed me.So, here I am looking for fun, sporty, comfortable, reasonably fuel efficient sedan or hatch in the 15-25k range. Which has led me to be very interested in either a used TSX or ILX. Both with the 2.4L + stick options.Has anyone driven both? How do they compare in terms of interior quality, sportiness, driving dynamics, and comfort/luxury?My main concern with the ILX is that I am afraid that it will feel cheap or unrefined. The idea of an entry level sporty luxury is very appealing to me. I would absolutely love to get a 3-series, but I'm scared off by the questionable reliability plus maintenance and repair costs. However, I have always liked the civic si, but have been turned away by the boy racer attitude and interior (especially the double dash...) so the idea of a more mature, comfortable, yet still fun si is extremely appealing to me.From what I can tell, the TSX seems to have a nicer interior, but it's hard to tell in pictures. I would be very curiously about your opinions. (And How does it compare to the new accord, new A3, or ATS which I've been in?).My main concerns with the TSX are:1. It will feel old/dated quickly. I think the car already looks a bit "last gen". Worried how it will continue to age over the next few years. 2. It will feel too big. I test drove both a 2014 accord sport and a v6 coupe a few weeks ago. I liked aspects of both, but both felt too big and boat like. The handling was solid and the ride was good, but they felt like big cars to me. Every car feels big to me coming out of the FRS, but the accord felt much more Camry to me than sporty sedan (such as mazda3 or GLI that I've driven)I have also been very interested in the new 2.5L mada3 and the mk7 GTI, so for anyone that can compare these to those... I would be very curious about that as well. The issue with both of those is that I would probably have to wait a bit for the 2015s to start popping up as used, or spend a bit more to get what I want. I also would lose the Acura badge, which does mean something. Final question, when shopping for a 2nd gen TSX, I came across some that are lower on miles (35-50k) and CPO for 22-24k, and some with more miles (75-80k) cheaper around 15-16k. I'd love to get the cheaper version and lower my car payment by a nice $150, but the mileage scares me. How reliable are these? How costly are they to repair and maintain? What sorts of things should I be looking for on higher mileage examples? Basically, I need to decide if I am better off spending more upfront on a lower mileage car with a CPO warranty, or spending less and being out of warranty with more miles.Thanks in advance!

I used the thaumium grafter to get two stacks of saplings and I have been going at it. Also note the repairing healing axe. I am more stopping it from getting near my base. We could quarry the whole thing out but that wouldn't be fun and look terrible. We could disable taint spread but that would be lame and the server owner is not on much. Any thoughts or ideas??

The words that fluttered between us suddenly fell back down to earth unable to jump the ocean or the land mass. Nothing could keep them up; gravity was suddenly too strong. So those words fell, down to earth, upon deaf ears. Those ears—un-hearing except for Big Voice announcements and “Incoming” drills. Those ears—who heard something completely different than what anyone…what I was saying. So I walked, I moved forward as it was the only direction that I knew. The pin ups and post cards came and went with the requested mixed CDs. All of the giving was a bit of myself broken down,  raw and packaged—meant to arrive before going rancid. And all of the taking from so many—and I had no idea. No idea that you were the taking kind, I thought I knew.But now…now I know.

I'm not sure if there is an actual reason why it wouldn't work with the first netmask, or whether I'm encountering a bug in the OS.Edit:As I haven't been very clear by what I mean by 'not working' I'll add some extra details.  A client of my company asked us to set the ip addresses of two servers they are buying off us to be dual bonded. We don't usually do this, but sales decided it wouldn't be too difficult, so said that it's fine! As we only have the two servers to set up, we have them on their own switch. They are adjacent ip addresses, both within the same /24 net mask, so also in the same /22 mask. There is no default gateway, as for the moment they do not need to talk to any other networks. I am unable to ping one server from the other when I have the network cards bonded with /22 mask, but I can when they are unbonded, or bonded but with /24 mask. Thanks for the comments so far.

Running from January 18th - January 27th, the Phoenix Players production of Aladdin is set in the Chinese town of Peking.  While Wishee Washee and Widow Twanky wrestle with running and promoting their laundrette, Aladdin is no help at all - distracted by the beautiful Princess Jasmine.  As the Princess and Aladdin fall in love, their plans are devastated by the evil wizard Abanaza.  With the princess taken prisoner, and transported to Egypt, can Aladdin save the day?The performers will be accompanied by a live band, and dancers from the Classique School of Dance.Aladdin is on from January 18 to January 27, on Friday and Saturdays at 7.30pm, and matinees on Saturdays and Sundays at 2.30pm.Tickets cost £6 to £8 from the Phoenix Players on 0845 467 96462 or go to http://portsmouthpanto.co.uk.This is, unfortunately, likely to be the last production at St Peters Theatre, so if you've not yet seen this building, this could be your last opportunity.

1glb2y	-31382	1371572038	TalesFromRetail	Customer hates the linear nature of time.	This story happened almost a decade ago, when I worked at a large supermarket that opened late into the evening.  It's also the only time a customer ever indicated displeasure with me and my service.I was working on tills, and it was fairly late on a Saturday evening - around 8:30pm.  It was quiet, and things were relaxed and pretty chill.  A customer started unpacking their purchases onto the belt, and I greet them, and ask if they would like help packing.  The customer declines the offer, and, as it's not busy, and there are no queues, I wait for the minute or so it takes for her to finish unloading her products, and when she is ready, and good to go, I start scanning her stuff.As a young cashier, who worked all day saturdays, I was quite fast and efficient at scanning, and could easily keep pace with a family of four packing.  However, it was evening, and I was taking things easy, and making sure I didn't overload the customer... Or so I thought... my customer started to get a small backlog of items to bag - less than a dozen items.  She had her bags piled at the end of the bagging area, covering an IR scanner that progresses the conveyor belt, so over time it h had got congested by me and my barcode scanner, which I notice just after I scan a large sack of spuds - so I keep hold of the potatoes for a moment to let her catch up.She then asks me to slow down, so she has a chance to clear the backlog.  I already had stopped, but figured she was concentrating on packing, and probably hadn't realised.  I ask her again, with a friendly smile, if she'd like a hand with the packing, and she re-itterates that she is fine.  So I continue to wait patiently for her to catch up.  Once there was some space on the belt, I put down the hefty sack of spuds that I had scanned a good thirty seconds earlier, and had since been holding awkwardly.  The customer then reminds me, in an aggressive tone, that she had asked me to slow down.  I apologise, despite having scanned no new items since her asking me the first time.  I wait for her to finish clearing the backlog.As she cleared the backlog, and sorted herself out, she moved some of her already packed bags back into her trolly... which caused the automatic conveyor belt to fire up.  She then tells me for the third time that she had asked me to wait for her.  By now, the frustrations of keeping a smile on my face, throughout her rudeness, after having been on till for most of the previous 9 hours, and doing exactly as she asked whilst offering extra assistance had got to me.  I tell her that "I have not scanned a singe item since you first asked me to slow down.  I can't scan any slower than that"Immediately she asks for the duty manager... "uh oh" I think... "I probably shouldn't have been so sarcastic...". My manager was a scary guy, who lurked in the back office.  I didn't want a run in with him if I could help it!  Thinking fast I call the evening checkout runner over by name, and introduce her as my manager (Technically true, as I was currently reporting to her, and she got to decide when my tea break was, and whether I should work shop floor, or stay on tills).  The customer rants at her, and she placates the customer by saying that she'd have a word with me once the transaction is complete.I finish the customers transaction, taking care to wait for each item to be packed before scanning the next.  The customer leaves, and I'm asked to explain myself.  I tell my side of the story in much the same way I have told you guys... she laughs, calls the customer a stuck up bitch, and never mentions it again!

I enjoy it's complexity and difficulty. I am having a bit of an issue with making Isk. The issue being that I cannot seem to really make a reasonable amount of it. I have two characters, one for pvp and warfare (my main) and one that I have decided to be a mining/industry alt. I am currently flying a retriever and training for a hulk then orca for leading mining ops. The issue that I seem to have is that I dont really pull in that much per hour with my mining operation. I guess this was a rather long winded question but it really boils down to something that I am very curious about. How is it that people pull in millions and millions of Isk an hour? What are people doing that I am not? If someone could lead me in the right direction to start  really making a significant portion of Isk I would appreciate it. What do you all do to make a lot of ISkies? Thanks in advance.

2rd9qh	-31392	1420431262	TheRedPill	I came across a TIFU post. Op was friend-zoned for the last 10 years and recently won her over. Wanted to share and hear your thoughts.	In the TIFU subreddit there was a story that made it near the frontpage of a guy who had been friend-zoned for the last 10 years. He tells her his true feelings at dinner and she then nearly dies from choking. Op saves her and she doesnt mention it until some time later.Op describes an uneasy uncomfortable car ride home. Later she texts him and invites him over and the short of it is that they end up making out and she accepts him as a boyfriend. (I think temporarily) .The post in question has a follow up link with the continuation to this story. Op experiences a follow up by the female in question either sharing his feelings or she feels bad for him and agrees temporarily until he either fucks it up or she comes to her senses and realizes why she friend-zoned him in the first place.Im thinking that this dude was friend-zoned for the last 10 years for typical reason(s) by the female. Whats the over-under on a reversal of her acceptance? I would like to hear your thoughts as this post makes my spidey senses go crazy.

This would be a great feature! I honestly did not know what scrobbling meant before your suggestion so I looked it up. This looks like a real cool feature from Last fm. Thanks for showing this to me I am going to try this on my computer at home.  The Echo being able to do this would be awesome  I will pass your idea over to our developers.

So after missing out on countless cool moments and after a lot of trial and error I found something that works. I have no idea why it does, but it does consistently. If you press the share button then the options button it will take you to the share settings, from there go to video clip settings. Uncheck "include microphone audio in video clip" and display icons for blocked scenes". From then on when you press the share button, the prompt to press square to save a clip will appear normally. Hope this helps.

uiffj	-31429	1338715175	plants	Herb Robert, or Geranium Robertianum.  Anyone have any experiences with this plant's healing properties?	I recently completed my first ethnobotany course at Western Washington University and for my final presentation I presented on Herb Robert (also known as Red Robin, Death Come Quickly, or Robert's Geranium).  In my presentation I focused primarily on the healing of the effects of Germanium, one of the plant's constituents.What I'm interested in is the claim that this plant can treat, or even cure cancer.  Apparently Germanium increases oxygen flow to cells, which according to one Nobel Prize winning scientist (Otto Warburg, 1966) should help.  He said "The prime cause of cancer is lack of oxygenation of the cells." Seems like this plant should do wonders?I'm curious if anyone has any first hand account of this working?  Or maybe you know of a medical journal that has published evidence of Herb Robert/Germanium Robertianum having cancer healing qualities?  The questions after my report have piqued my interest and I would love reddit's input.Thanks!

I've spent $450 on the linework alone.  While I'm pretty satisfied with how it looks, I'm not looking forward to spending upwards of $500 for a $400 tattoo.A tattoo artist that I've gotten work done from before just opened his own shop and quoted me $50 dollars for doing the remaining work on this piece (at a discount to get new business).  I was quoted at $125 by the original artist.  Seeing as I'm not overly impressed by the first artist, I'm paying more than expected, and I can get  cheaper, potentially higher quality color done elsewhere, should I switch artists?  Is it bad etiquette?  Is it just a bad idea?  Maybe it's normal to spend this much over the estimate, and I'm really not trying to be a cheap jerk.  But I don't want to get ripped off either.  Thanks
115ipf	-31429	1349725177	loseit	First post here-I just finished my first week "on the wagon"	My back story:  I've always been a little in the husky side.  I come from a family of very overweight people with a "eat everything on your plate" attitude.  That was fine until I hit 22, my metabolism slowed, I quit smoking, and fell into something of a sustained depression.  It's two years later and I've gone from 210lb to 245. 6' and 210lb wasn't too bad, but almost hitting 250 has wrecked my self esteem.  Until a week ago.  I've been cycling (stationary bike) 10 miles a day, eating a balanced low calorie diet of fruits, veggies, lean meats and mixed grains, and taking time every day to make sure I'm evaluating myself based in the things I do, not on what other people may or may not think of me.  Today marks the first day of my second week, and I'm down 2.8 lbs.  2.8 is a full pound over my goal.  How can I keep this momentum going?  Any suggestions for maintaining this drive and not burning out?TL;DRI've lost 2.8 lbs in my first week and want some suggestions on how to keep up my momentum.

Pretty damn humiliating.The size 40s were a bigger size of my old favorite pants, a 36" waist I had saved even after they stopped fitting.  Once those 40s split I've been waiting to fit back into the old 36s.  As of today I'm 20 lbs lighter than I was then and they fit like a dream.  Im never going back to those 40s again.

Check this out, it's a really cool local music festival that needs your support"Yellingham, Bellingham's only annual house-show, DIY music festival is happening for the 4th year on April 12-14 2013.  The event brings dozens of bands from around the region to Bellingham for one weekend of music in basements, living-rooms, and community centers all around town, and is 100% donation based.  To help raise money, we've started a kickstarter page.  Even though we've reached our goal we still need your help.Every year we set our kickstarter goal very low.  We run this project on a shoestring budget and keep zero profits for ourselves.  Every dollar from this kickstarter goes directly into the hands of musicians playing the fest.  Every dollar over our goal adds up to better guarantees for out of town bands and less pressure on those unable to donate over the course of the festival.  PLEASE help support your local underground music scene and donate at the link below.  Plus, you'll get some really great Yellingham gear as a reward.  Shoot, for $60, you'll get guilt free access into every show of the fest.  We're releasing part of the lineup this week, so stay tuned!http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yellingham/yellingham-music-festival-2013yellingham.org"

Is there even an opposing camp of gamers or analysts that are excited for these features (ie the mandatory online check-ins, the always-on kinect, and the entire used game clusterfuck).

I'm curious what this subreddit thinks of certain games getting released simultaneously on both current and next gen consoles.  I remember at the end of the ps1's life franchises like tony hawk skateboarding put out a ps1 and ps2 version of their games, and the release for the current gen console was severely lacking in quality and content.  With these rumors of fallout 4 (among other titles) getting released on 360/ps3 as well as Xbone/ps4, are any late adopters worried their current gen editions will be less polished, inferior experiences?  Do you think the differences will be as significant this generation?  What do you all think?
1ny5sn	-31429	1381192272	GrandTheftAutoV	Looking to start a crew focused around the Gambetti family from GTAIV (XBOX)	I know GTA Online isn't really about role-playing, but I thought it would be fun to have a crew of mobsters looking to gain a foothold in Los Santos.  With only the Ballas, Vagos, and Families gangs making an appearance, there's a serious lack of mafioso presence in V.  I figure if any of the families were to make a grab for Los Santos it would be the Gambettis, so I've started a crew on social club called Gambetti Family LS (GAMB).  If this sounds fun to you, submit your xbox 360 gamertag and I can send you an invite.

It's been driving me nuts and making my computer unusable.I'm running windows 8 on a Dell Inspiron 660S.  So here's the deal.  About every 10-20 seconds my mouse is left-clicking on it's own. I started having the problem while using the USB mouse that came with the computer (basic Dell laser mouse).  I just switched it out for my old Dell mouse (USB, laser) and I'm having the exact same problem.  Tried switching USB ports as well.  No improvement.  It's taken me 5 minutes to type this because the random clicking has been moving my cursor all over the place.  Any help would be amazing, as this has made my computer pretty much unusable.  Thanks guys, if you need any other info I'm happy to provide.

I sold my white ipad2 on Craigslist about a week before the launch of the new ipad, to offset the cost.I got $350 for it, and felt ok with the money (had it listed at 400).I bought a 32Gb wifi-only version of the new ipad, took it home, and loved it immediately.However, I ended up returning it yesterday for a few reasons:1) The battery took *forever* to charge.and2) It *felt* slower..(Only in a few areas was it actually noticeable to me: large, 3d games, and iBooks: but those are primarily what I use it for.)3) Size-wize, the 32GB would get eaten up too quickly if I tried to put HD movies on it, or took HD videos/pics.(I've figured out the reason the games and the book page-turning wasn't quite as snappy is because of the sheer number of pixels it has to push, with the new resolution. It seems to me that the new graphics chip would've handled that as well as my 2 did, but it just didn't.)I now am back to an ipad 2, which I ended up getting on CL also, for the same price that I sold mine for, so I'm all good, money-wise.Anyone else have a similar experience?

Around Christmas-time, when my wife was about 7 1/2 months pregnant, we visited her (I was in the process of divorcing my wife because of the whole sad issue), and I informed my mom that we were putting the child up for adoption because of financial reasons. (I didn't want to upset my mother with the whole drama of the upcoming divorce, and I was honestly embarrassed over the whole thing.) My mother called me almost daily for a week, going crazy on the phone that I was purposely "depriving her of a grandchild". I still didn't tell her what was really going on. A few days into January, my mom drove her car to a Wal-mart parking lot at 3 in the morning and shot herself in the head. I never told my wife about how I explained the pregnancy to my mom, and I'm finally getting divorced, but I can't help blaming her (my wife)for the result, and I can't help the hate I feel for her deep down.  There: I finally got it off my chest.

2kfap0	-31432	1414374804	TailsFromRetail	The cheapest, most annoying customer I've dealt with in a long, long, time.	Setup: a table of three (20-23 year-olds) sat in my my section. The "leader" initially made it very clear that she was from the corporate office. She proceeded to order a water for he friend, and then had the gall to order a "split" coca-cola for her other female friend and herself. (I've never been asked for this in my whole career of waiting tables.)  So, I brought the water for the other person, and the brought a Coke, split into two glasses, each about 3/4 full (because of the ice involved.) She explained that they barely drank any soda whatsoever; hence the splitting of the soda. She then immediately asked fro a manager: I told that the GM wasn't in, but I'd be happy to get the owner over to the table as quickly as possible.  She told the owner that I "had an attitude" when she asked for a spilt soda (It surprised me more than anything), and the next time I came by the table, she said something along the lines of "we really didn't mean to get you so scared when we asked for your owner drop by: I could see on your face that you *were* scared."  Whatever.  About 3 minutes before their entrees were due to hit the table, she ordered "garlic knots", which take about 12 minutes to cook in the pizza oven, so that they'd definitely be delivered *after* their entrees hit the table. She rolled her eyes, and said "Fine, just bring us another large basket of bread. I had that out in about 3 minutes, and she said: "you know what? We won't be needing that bread, with the garlic knots coming (hopefully), then asked for refills on her "split" sodas. I said to her "I really am quite sure you ordered more bread for the table, and also explained to her that we never have done split sodas before, and that I'd have no choice but to ring the extra soda up. She DID NOT like this answer, and passed on the refills. I offered waters, but she was having none of that. (I *did * mention that she was from the corporate office, right.?)  Anyway, when it came time for the bill, I asked the owner if we were going to discount her check whatsoever. (None of them had check-stubs from prior checks, which is usually all it takes to get a (minimal) discount on their bill.  Well, she went apeshit over that, and finally threw such a fit, the owner gave her a $6 discount on a $42 tab.  The icing on the cake: she left me a $3.00 tip on her (now) $39 tab.

Is it just me, or is there no way to switch between Dalvik or the Android Run Time (ART) compilers after updating to Lollipop 5.01? I've looked everywhere on this device, and can't find the option. I guess one way to find out if we're all on ART would be to download an app from the play store, and then immediately after it says "X  app is installed, then turn off your phone immediately. Then turn it back on. If there's any message at all about "Android is upgrading" then we're still on Dalvik, because when using Dalvik as as the compiler, it builds a Dalvik cache folder so all your apps are ready to go. ART waits until you use an app for the first time to compile and optimize it.  (But basically, I just want to know if the option's been taken away because Android has just given up on ART as a compiler? Anyone know?

3fnhsn	-31432	1438628445	gofundme	Hi. I'd never have considered this, but I'm in pretty dire straits:	This is my story, (and it's long), but bear with me: My life began to fall apart in October of 2012. My wife let me know she was pregnant, and wanted to "tell her girlfriends" the good news. However, after asking my wife her due date, and doing some basic math, I knew immediately that the child couldn't be mine (we were continually arguing over her overspending, and I actually was sleeping in the guest room, so I knew the last date we had sex.) She denied it, then admitted cheating, but would never tell me who the father was. Around Christmas time, we visited my mother for Christmas dinner, and she exclaimed "She's pregnant? How did I not know this?" I was too embarrassed about the whole situation to have told my mom earlier. I had no idea how upset my mother was over the whole thing, until late January: my mother (who did suffer from depression) went to Academy, bought a .38 caliber handgun, drove to a local Walmart in the middle of the night, and shot and killed herself. I was devastated emotionally. ANYWAY, two months later, while working as a server/bartender (as I'd done for the past 25 years), I was getting an awful pain in my right hip. I was referred to a hip specialist, and after seeing an M.R.I., informed me that "you need a full hip replacement on your right side, like yesterday; I'm surprised the head of your femur hasn't collapsed, because it's about to." I had a hip replacement 5 days later. I also filed for divorce, from my hospital bed, while I was recovering. That cost me an initial 8K retainer (because I got a good lawyer.) I healed for 4 months before I was ready to go back to work. In the meantime, my future ex-wife brought home another man's child (who I proved wasn't mine via a prenatal DNA test.) She was finally forced by the state to reveal the father's identity: it was her boss all along. I just buckled down and went back to my job to tell my boss that I'd be back to work the next week, and to show him that I didn't even have a limp after 4 months, which I didn't. UNFORTUNATELY, (REALLY, REALLY, UNFORTUNATELY), on the way home from talking to my boss, I was involved in an accident, and I rebroke my right femur in half, and shattered the bone all around the titanium device they put in my hip. I had to call my surgeon from the ambulance and tell him what happened. He met me at the hospital, looked at the new x-rays, and told me straight up: "You REALLY messed that leg up. We'll just have to do the best we can...". They ended up removing the initial device, which was only 4" long, and inserted a rod that goes almost to my knee. I ended up with my right leg over an inch and a half shorter than my left, ultimately. I was also off my feet again, unable to work, for another 20 months, during the whole time trying to deal with the divorce.(Initially, our divorce decree had her named as our daughter's primary custodian.) However, I caught her one morning hitting our daughter in the face (over what she wanted for breakfast, no less), and tape recorded my daughter admitting what happened, and secretly recorded the wife saying "Damn right, I hit her, and I'll pop her right in the mouth again if she ever talks back like that again." Well, that was all the ammunition I needed: I called my lawyer and demanded that we go back to mediation, but this time with ME being granted primary custody of our daughter. We went, I won, and now she's FINALLY moved out, our divorce is final, AND my daughter lives with me. But, I've just barely gotten into the work force, and because of my leg, I can only work short shifts at a local restaurant. All that time off, the divorce, paying for my mother's funeral, just drained my life savings to basically nothing. Now, I'm doing my best to get back on my feet, but I'm basically living off tips, week to week, and can't even afford to pay for my daughter to have any new clothes for school.  I KNOW this is a REALLY long post, but I REALLY need some help. It's been a rough 3 years for me AND my daughter, and I just want to be able to provide for her more than I'm able to right now.  Please help if you could: ANYTHING would be EXTREMELY appreciated.

I think if more teams would be like this (another one that comes to mind is lemon dogs) I think they would find it helping their record and progression as a team as well. GO EG!!!

2niubt	-31435	1417042194	leagueoflegends	Never-ending Mountain of Bugs...	I don't like to complain...I love League and I think Riot mostly does a great jobI also know they are trying to focus on E-Sports (understandably)Although, the issue I have (not sure is I'm alone here) is that they seem to just add more and more bugs onto the pile every single time they update something...I understand in a game like this, or any game for that matterthere WILL be bugs, some may take longer than others to fix.But the issue I have here, is that they seem to just be sloppy/lazy things that are getting by.They add new Items or champions for expample, and those new aditions just completely break or ruin other champions or items. Some examples off the top of my head is the Wukong and Elixer of Iron where his clone doesn't change size, The BORK bug, WarWick and the new jungle items/enchants, plenty more if I had the time to research and post more. But you get the idea. The Wukong issue and the WW issue could have been examined if they just asked "what will THIS change affect that is ALREADY in the game?"Sorry to complain so much, not like me. But wanted to see if others felt the same.TLDR: Riot seems to have NEW bugs or other issues affecting the game with EVERY new patch, while the ones from older patches still exist, which causes them to just pile up and become buried and forgotten. I feel as though more attention to detail could help this. Leave thoughts in comments. Don't post often, sorry for grammar and spelling / Formatting  ahead of time, at work.

30310i	-31435	1427161001	elderscrollsonline	Screw The Haters..	I just think the people who hate on this game are NOT approaching it  correctly.. The more I play this game the more I love it. It combines the feel of an MMO with the ElderScrolls Universe almost perfectly. Yes it has its flaws, yes it has its bugs (as does any game! not that I don't want to see them fixed:P ) But these Devs really put their hearts into making this game. Not to mention, how many FULLY VOICED MMOs do you see? And with ElderScrolls quality voice acting. The soundtrack is amazing as expected with any ElderScrolls game, and this game is BEAUTIFUL! All the people going on about "It doesn't even look as good as Skyrim did, the graphics are so dated" clearly know nothing about MMOs... I just think the game is fantastic.. and the Devs accomplished their goal of combining MMOs and the ElderScrolls Universe. There are also the "money Grabbing" aspects.. but the devs don't make that decision (morons). So overall... I think the haters really have no valid points when they call the game "bad". I cannot wait to see the game grow with the new non-sub model. and I can't wait to see where they choose to take it. 
32ldsz	-31435	1429037257	electronic_cigarette	Which to buy first?	So basically I just recently tried someone's Sigeli 150 (holy shit that thing is great) and their Herakles Sub ohm tank. I will be coming up on some extra money here soon and will probably purchase one of these, but unfortunately cannot get both just yet. So I was wondering which I would benefit from more first. I currently have an IPV2s and an Aspire atlantis. (I also build of course) and my IPV pushes up to 60W (70 with update) but the atlantis only goes up to 30. So just wondering from people who may have used these devices.. Would I have better luck with the Sigeli and Atlantis or with the IPV2s and the Herakles? :) Any opinions would be appreciated! thanks! I honestly can't wait to have both.. but essentially just want to get an idea of which is going to give me the better performance increase by itself.
35zdtx	-31435	1431634064	wow	Losing that "spark"	So I have played WoW since BC.. raided hard in Wrath, and Cata, dropped out a bit in MoP and just leveled, and then got back to it in WoD. But now... I am just kind of losing that "spark" I used to have with this game for all those years. I can't find a guild that has a good raid schedule for me because of work and gf, and pugging is uselss.. I am still sitting at 680 Ilevel which I guess isn't terrible. But without a good raiding scheduale my main just feels useless... I basically get on and do my garrison then do nothing cause I don' have time to raid, and when I do... I can't get into a half decent group. So then I'm like "I know, I'll go level an alt!" (which i love, or did). But then it's like leveling goes soooooooooo fast now, and when I hit 100... it will just be the same story as my current alt. So I guess... I am just wondering what I can try to get that spark back.. Should I just try harder to find a guild with a better raiding schedule for me? Should I try something new? Or should I just quit... at least for a while? It is a sad day my friends :(

Just for some background, I of course started on your typical premium brands like Space Jam, Cutwood, etc. and some awesome local juice companies here in OH. Well then the problem began when I got a better tank and a better mod and started plowing through juice like it's nothing... so needless to say, at the rate I go through juice the $20+ for a 30ml BS isn't going to cut it.. So I found places like Mt.Baker and Mech Sauce. And I do love a few flavors from these places, but with the long shipping time from Mech and most of the flavors needing steeping, I am looking for other places to check out, that offer similar prices (Mech charges $15 for a 120ml...) but still awesome juice! I am willing to budge with that price a bit as long as it is still reasonable! Any suggestions are welcome! Look forward to seeing what people are vaping on and can recommend!

2kotzs	-31441	1414601095	sex	I'm a married (30) man that just failed to climax during sex with my wife (30). I feel horrible and need advice.	We have been married for five years now. I never once had this problem. I feel so ashamed and embarrassed. My wife feels like it was her fault. That I don't find her sexy or attractive anymore. This is not the case. She still gets me going. The sex last night was amazing. I just couldn't finish. I feel that I psyched myself out. We are currently trying for our first child and I wanted to everything I could to make it happen last night. I put a lot of pressure on myself to finish and when it wasn't happening I got really embarrassed and couldn't relax and enjoy. I feel horrible for what happened. Communication between me and my wife is limited now because of this. She feels it was her fault and I can't convince her otherwise. I would love some advice on how to approach this with her and allow us to get back at it. Thanks. Edit:  Wow. This blew up with insights and advice. Thank you all for your efforts. I read each one of your responses. More back story, we have been trying for a kid for about a year now. It hasn't been going very well. We did get pregnant once, but that ended in a miss carriage at 8 weeks. That was about two months ago. My wife is still feeling a little down about it. Our intimacy levels have been down since it happened. It wasn't anyone's fault for not engaging in sexy times, just life kept getting in the way. A lot has happened to my wife this year and she feels in a funk and not really self confident. So today, powered by your comments, my wife and I talked about what happened. I explained to her what everyone said here about it being no ones fault and it sometimes just happens. And seems to happen a lot. We talked about how it was just a fluke and we should try again...and we did tonight and had lift off. So again thank you all for your kind words.

It recently sprained my ankle - the latest in many injuries and it occurs to me that with virtually every injury, inflammation is undesired and vigorously counter-acted. But we must've had a reason to evolve it. Or is it just some kind of atavistic throw back?

I know that the Roman culture considered suicide acceptable outcomes with certain circumstances (regaining honour, ect). But I was recently wondering exactly *how* the Romans committed suicide. In the history texts that I've read it's usually written "fell upon his sword". I always assumed that this was a figure of speech - the mechanics of propping up a sword and then falling or leaning into always seemed outlandish and excessive to me - but I recently came across this painting, [The Suicide of Saul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Suicide_of_Saul). The first detail seems to show Saul *literally* having thrown himself upon the point of his sword. Any thoughts, Redditors?

I'm not saying that the mid-game and the end-game are bad, I just can't shake the feeling that the start-game is the best part of XCOM. I like the art design of the human firearms the best, the sound effects for the weapons are masculine and meaty, the risk is high, and the fatality rate is staggering. Its pretty much perfect there. Thoughts?

This came about because I had a surplus of mid-high level assaults, one of whom had suffered a serious wound that left her Will in the 40s. I never liked her that much, so I decided I'd get the most use out of her remaining days instead of firing her. For safety's sake, I always deployed her furthest away from the crux of my squad (panic fires), and fitted her with heavy hitting firearms (alloy cannon). From that point on, my "Risker" took on every high risk/high reward move I had available. Basically all the crap I'd try to pull on normal, that'd I'm too risk adverse to try on Classic.And you know what? She died. But she survived 8 drops and made some spectacular kills - multiple sectopods, at least one ethereal, solo'd a squad of mutons + berserker support. I was real proud of her. And that's what I'm utilizing from now on, every squad incorporates one shotgun-assault, who's job is to kick in doors and get shot to hell. "The light that burns twice as bright, burns half as long." *Semper Terra!*

27uyev	-31443	1402471255	billiards	Helping picking a cue	Alright, former regular player (weekly or more) looking to get back into the game. But I haven't played in about two years. I still own my old cue, it's a fairly plain McDermott cue. I think it's an all maple affair with a wood to wood joint, weighs in around 19oz. I'm considering getting myself a new cue (I never really loved the way my cue shot), but I'm not sure how to proceed. The last time I bought a cue, I feel a little like I didn't know what the hell I was doing and I'm looking for some guidance. I'm definitely out for a performance cue here, I don't care about looks. If I'm playing well enough, that will speak for itself. I've borrowed friend's cues before, which had metal joints. I think I might be looking for that feel, it seemed like it pushed the weight of the cue forward of my strong hand. My current cue shoes pretty okay, but its a little stained with use and I'm always fighting off a paranoid sense that it might be slightly warped. But whenever I roll it on the table, it seems fine. So I guess what I'm asking is:* Should I buy a new cue?* Should I just get a new shaft instead?* What companies should I look at? * What's the best place to buy them? * Web? In person? I live in New York City, is there a good place for me to try a cue out?  
2oqakt	-31443	1418105098	DungeonWorld	Help Making Low Magic - Magic Items	So I'm running a fantasy historical game for my players that's a low magic setting. In my last game, I put my players inside a town and allowed them to meet the citizens and shop keeps. Then I started to kill them off one by one. The killer was actually a body jumping pre-historic feline entity that hates people. My PCs are eventually cornered and killed it and recovered the feline's gigantic, super-dangerous claws. They're going to want to use it as loot. But I don't know what else to do to it aside from making it sharp and killy - piercing and + damage. Which seems kind of boring. Any ideas? I feel like I wrote myself into a corner by building a low magic setting that doesn't have wiz-bang lightning bolts everywhere...

Somethings are cheap enough that they can be replaceable - and pens get lost anyway. But I'd like to know my options. Any other ideas? 
2qigwf	-31443	1419661359	DnD	How to turn back from murderhoboing?	Okay. So I made some mistakes.

But I'm getting a little tired of them being murderhobos. How do I give a shared identity? 
2qii0u	-31443	1419662299	DungeonWorld	I screwed up. How do I fight murderhoboing?	Okay, I'll admit it. I messed up. I started the game with the PCs as separate mercenaries that were *coincidentally* hired for a caravan escort. The job went very, very badly wrong and now they've been stumbling from one adventure to another. I thought that a band of plucky thrown-togethers would be fun and we had worked to establish a limited backstory (composed of three discrete triads that knew each other, and one 'hub' character that had drawn everyone in), but a bunch of my players have dropped out due to life and other players have joined. As a result, nobody has any shared history with anyone else and they've slowly devolved into a band of wandering killers. What do?

I had no choice but to change it back to +1 for the rest of the season and hang my head in shame.

I'm not asking what are the absolute best, but just your preference.  Mine:1. Kendrick Lamar - Good Kid M.A.A.D City (2012)  * This is one of the best albums to come out in the last few years and is an automatic classic in my eyes *  Favorite song: Money Trees2. Childish Gambino - Camp (2011) * I couldn't stand his voice at first but he became one of my favorite rappers after this.  GREAT music all around from start to finish. *  Favorite song: Bonfire3. 88 Keys - Death of Adam (2008) * I don't think I've heard anything from 88 Keys before or since this album but this album felt like I was watching a movie I can relate to.  *  Favorite song: Stay Up! (Viagra)4. Mos Def - The Ecstatic (2009) * Not Mos' best but definitely a solid album from him. *  Favorite song: Priority5. Saigon - Bread and Circuses (2011) * I consider myself a Saigon fan, but his first album disappointed the hell outta me, so I wasn't expecting much, but this album sounded like he grew as an artist.  Definitely an album you can play from start to finish. * Favorite song: Let Me Run

1h0hqa	-31446	1372128951	Xenoblade_Chronicles	What are your complaints about Xenoblade Chronicles?	I just finished the game last night and I enjoyed it.  I didn't love it though.  Mainly for the following reasons (no spoilers).This game seemed like the jack of all trades.  It had SO much going on, that I was literally still learning things up until the last boss battle.  And it kind of annoyed me that they would keep introducing things halfway though the game (Spike).There were so many useless items, gems, weapons, collectables, that it all became clutter after a while.  It was also difficult to quickly customize characters.  I found myself spending about 20 minutes every time to upgrade all of my characters equipment, then remove the gems i liked, then attach them to the new items.Some characters seemed so worthless while some were absolutely necessary.  I almost never used Melia because she was a liability that i had to constantly keep reviving.  I was also handcuffed to Sharla for ANY tough battle because no one else could heal like her. My last issue is the fact that some characters were just so dumb.  Sharla would always seem to heal me when I didn't need it, but kept auto-attacking when I did.All in all I put in 80 hours into the game, and I enjoyed it, but it could have been better.

There are so many times in this like where the offensive line and running back are out of sync in terms of athletic talent.  Sometimes you get situations where a team has a great LT but the rest of the line is shit.  Or a line that finally hits their stride but the RB is getting old.  We have a very young and athletic line that can potentially dominate for YEARS. And we also have one of the top rated RBs coming into the draft.  If Chance, Brian, Lewan, and Sankey can all play to their potential (and stay healthy), then this offense can be very scary.We will have more to look forward to than 3-and-outs every time.

2e2od1	-31446	1408535912	hiphopheads	So I went to Blu's show last night..	Let me preface this by saying I have been a huge Blu fan for 5+ years.  So being a fan I kind of know the type of person he is and I had a pretty good guess on how the show would go down.  As other fans know, he can come off looking like he doesn't care about or almost lazy at times.  Unfortunately, this show did nothing to change these thoughts.He came out around 10:30 (show time is at 9 and had only 1 opener).  Did a couple songs off of NoYork, then one off of Below the Heavens, then finished with two songs from his new album (to be fair these were the best songs off of it).He only performed for like 30-40 mins so that was annoying right there, but his song selection was so questionable.  he picked such random songs, and had the nerve to hold out the mic a few times thinking the crowd will fill in the words.  Not saying the crowd wasn't feeling it but they just didn't really know these songs like that.Not to mention, he has zero showmanship.  He had the Mic in one hand and the mic stand in the other. and stood in that spot rapping for 95% of the show.The good things about the show were the opening act and opening DJ.  I cant remember either of their names but I will try to find out.  But they both brought the energy I'm looking for from a live show.Overall, I am still a fan, but I'm crazy disappointed in him.  I brought my girlfriend with me and she was talking shit all night and I couldn't say shit to defend him.

1r32qk	-31462	1384980048	solar	Is it better to have shaded solar panels facing south or solar panels with sun exposure facing east?	I recently had solar heating installed on our pool and the company failed to inform us ahead of time that we need to trim 4 giant oak trees in order for the solar to operate efficiently. The trees are shading the 4 panels for most of the day except for about an hour when they are only partly shaded. Trimming the trees seems like it would be a big hassle because it will cost a lot of money up front and there are so many branches that it will probably not even get rid of all the shade. I will probably also need to trim again in the future. The east side of our house gets direct sun exposure for 4-5 hours a day. It's probably too late to move the existing panels, but would it make more sense to spend $700 to install 4 additional panels on the east side of house instead of paying over $700 for trimming? Our company has not been a good source of advice on the matter.

Beacon not showing up in Spawn menu (xbox)	What would cause my spawn beacon to not show in my spawn menu?I was playing a regular TDM game earlier and I kept putting out spawn beacons. I was gaining the "Squad Spawn on You" points through the entire game. However, every time I died, I found that the beacon was not in my spawn menu. I assumed the first few times that the enemy team had destroyed the spawn beacon. But it kept happening in spots that I have never lost a beacon before.Assuming the enemy had been destroying it, I began burying it in a nice safe corner of the map that I could look at during the spawn menu. When I died, I could still see my spawn beacon's blue logo in the Spawn menu MAP,  but I was ONLY able to select Random Spawn Point. What gives? I know I was not in HC mode because my team was spawning in on my beacon the entire game.

28qgwz	-31478	1403372824	TalesFromRetail	Produce Department Fun...	Story #1I'm currently in high school, and work in a grocery store produce section. I started working there about this time last summer, and the first week I was there, I was alone for about an hour one evening (the other guy working went on his lunch break). While I'm stocking apples, a man walks in, wearing his Farrel's eXtreme Bodyshaping tank top, probably just finished his "workout" across the street. For those of you who don't know, Farrell's is basically a gym where you pay for a membership to go to some guy's version of p90x six days a week. As he's browsing through my produce department in comes 8/10 mid 20's woman, the guy apparently went to high school with her. He starts chatting her up, the usual bullshit, "nice to see you," "it's been so long," "we should grab a drink some time." After their conversation ends, he turns and says "Hey, I've been looking through your apples here, and I don't see any Pink Ladies." I tell him we don't have any. He, a grown ass man, then proceeds to start to yell about us not having any Pink Lady apples, how dare we not have any of his favorite apples in stock we should've known he was coming in tonight, and made plans accordingly. Old high school friend saw the whole encounter, I just kind of stood there awkwardly, I didn't really know what to say, needless to say I don't think the two of them ever had their drinks together. Story #2We have an old lady, we like to call her the crazy tomatoe lady, she calls the store multiple times a week, asking about the price of tomatoes, and every Wednesday, she comes in, buys 6 or 7 pounds of Roma tomatoes, asks one of us to weigh them, and figure out how much it'll cost, then leaves. Nobody has any idea what she does with all of those tomatoes.On a similar note, our store is located somewhat near where the appartment complexes where a lot of the immigrants  who come into our city stay. And every week, an African family comes in and buys habaneros, lots of habaneros, one time they bought all of the habaneros on the shelf, and the two 10 lb. cases we had in the back, again no idea what they do with them.
29dbu0	-31478	1404013882	MensRights	Debunking Article Claiming Woman Was Raped By MRA.	So I'm sure we've all seen [this article](http://www.xojane.com/it-happened-to-me/my-date-with-an-mra) it is currently one of the most highly upvoted posts on r/feminism, but the article lacks any factual or logical backing, and I not only perceived it as a slanderous account but have managed to debunk it using relatively simple forensics and logic. I left this comment debunking it in the comments section in /r/feminism in hopes that some would see it and think logically enough before calling MRA's evil: "This entire article is complete bullshit, there's no evidence at all to support it. Why doesn't anyone ask why she didn't call the police after being "physically and sexually assaulted?" If what she said happened really happened, it's a horrific, and terrible crime. They each had all of each other's contact information, he could have easily harassed her, showed up at her home, murdered her, if this actually had happened, contacting the authorities would've been the first thing on her mind. Secondly the marks she showed on her arm don't represent that of a human grabbing another, it looks like a mark that could be left if you pinched the skin with your index finger and thumb, and then laid your three remaining fingers on top of your arm [as shown](http://i.imgur.com/wXkxb74.jpg?1) not wrapping your hand completely around their arm, this method, would in no way restrain anyone, and it appears that marks were self inflicted, [The damage](http://i.imgur.com/bEOdcO2.jpg?1) that I inflicted to myself is very similar to the damage on her arm, the only difference is the amount of skin pinched between the index and thumb, and the size of the hand pinching. I was able to leave visible marks on my forearm with little force, no pain, and no intent to leave lasting marks. Even if the location of the marks noted a slight possibility of a man wrapping his hand around her arms she noted in her story that his grip loosened just enough for her to escape, if this were the case, there'd be scratches trailing from the primary puncture wounds, but there aren't.And finally... The Red Pill, and Men's Rights, are not at all affiliated, The Red Pill was created to help men with self esteem issues get dates, MRA's want men who are victims of sexual assault and domestic violence to be taken seriously, they want genital mutilation of male minors to stop being commonplace in first world countries, they want to ensure that men get a fair chance in custody battles, they want to ensure that young boys who are falling behind in academics get the same attention as girls, they want to ensure that students at universities, are not expelled after sexual assault **accusations** without due process of law, they are **not** pick up artists. In conclusion this article is bullshit created to slander the men's right movement, and is an insult to the feminist movement, it trivializes rape and sexual assault victims, and their experiences in order to slander a movement that is trying to fight real social injustice."I'd like to know what your guys' thoughts on this debunking argument is, and on the article itself, thanks.

I feel like the mana curve for this deck was not ideal, and without any fireballs or pyroblasts or anything, I thought that it was going to be a bit of a flop. Could some of you more experienced players explain what made this deck do so well? Thanks!

This is my computer: http://pcpartpicker.com/user/Terrorontor/saved/Yn29TWI love it, but it tends to be pretty loud, and as someone who records gameplay commentaries and livestreams, I really need it to be quite a bit quieter. Silent would be ideal. If any of you fine gentlemen (*or ladies*) have suggestions for super quiet cooling (*preferably for less than or equal to $100*) I'd love to hear them. Thanks a ton!

1al0vo	-31506	1363684087	AppalachianTrail	Definitely on my bucket list.	I want to do this by the time I'm 50, which gives me just over two years to prepare. Reading all your posts here and watching Apache's vids have only fueled the fire. I wish I could just up and go right now. My two sons are into climbing and hiking in Washington state...I would love to hike the AT with them for 6 months. What a blast!
1axbnk	-31506	1364150679	AppalachianTrail	Springer to Damascus?	I've been talking about the AT with my brother-in-law and while we both agree that doing the whole trail might be too much as far as time from home/work, we've been tossing around the idea of at least doing the Smokies up to Damascus or maybe a little further maybe next year. Is there anything different to plan for or any tips in particular to consider or is it pretty much the same as planning for a through hike? I'm already thinking about doing a mail drop for Fontana and am debating whether to skip Gatlinburg or not. I'm figuring on 1 1/2 to 2 months to do it just to allow enough time, but I'd say we could probably do it in less time. I'm just getting my ducks in row now so it'll be easier when the time comes. I think I'm getting obsessed...lol
1b0lye	-31506	1364264329	AppalachianTrail	Hammock vs. Tent	I've been reading a lot about gear and such, and I'm kind of drawn to the idea of using a hammock while on the trail.

Another idle question that popped into my head...Planning on hiking the AT in the future with someone else and I was just wondering if anyone else had hiked with another person and how your trip went. Did you pretty much stay together the whole way or did you hike your own pace and split up during the day and just meet up at campsites or what? Is there any advantages in the way of carrying supplies, etc.? Disadvantages?

Is it me or are the weapons seriously out of balance between lower ranks and higher ones? I played the hell out of the beta and did pretty well, but it seems like I'm getting my ass handed to me when playing now. I chalk some of it up to not being familiar with the new maps, but I don't think I was doing as well on airport or the museum either. I dunno...maybe I'm just rusty.

It's a good basic rub that you can tweak whatever way you like; you can add more cayenne, garlic, whatever, to fit your taste.*  8T Paprika*  3T Cayenne*  5T Black pepper*  6T Garlic Powder*  3T Onion Powder*  6T Salt*  2 1/2T Dried Oregano*  2 1/2T Dried ThymeMix ingredients in a small bowl and store in an airtight container. Easy to make and adds a nice flavor. I tend to add more cayenne or mix with lemon pepper if I'm cooking chicken. One tip I use when applying a rub is to use olive oil cooking spray on the meat. It's quick and easy and I don't waste any of my "good" olive oil. Enjoy!

I just had a religious relative post that she and her SO have been alcohol free for 6 months now and went on with the whole "Praise Jesus, blah, blah, blah" spiel. I didn't reply, but this kind of shit really irks me. Why can't they see that it had nothing to do with any imaginary friends but with the fortitude and will power that they had inside themselves all along? I see this stuff all the time. Good musician or gifted athlete? It's from "god-given talent" not from hours of practice and hard work. It just pisses me off that people are either too insecure or too stupid to give themselves credit for their own achievements.

However, Reddit automatically enlargens any image I upload, making it look pixelated and low-res. As a result, if I shrink it down to about 20 pixels, it makes it about 40 and quite blurry. If I shrink it down to 40 pixels, it becomes about 80 and still somewhat blurry. Is there any way that I can reverse the enlargement by shrinking the uploaded image down with a css property?For comparison, you can look at the flairs on the subreddit I am a mod on (/r/Uniwar) and [my spritesheet](http://i46.tinypic.com/124zixc.png).

I want to have a plant-only stockpile next to my stills/farmer's workshops that doesn't have dwarves picking up the barrels ALL THE GODDAMN TIME, which interrupts the brewing/processing process because my brewer/farmer thinks the plant that would be in the barrel is no longer there. At the same time, I also want a plant stockpile near my farms that stores my plants in barrels so that I don't end up with plants everywhere. Naturally, I have the farm stockpile set up (linked) to give plants to the workshop stockpile. So I've tried numerous combinations of settings and none of them work the way I want them to:1. Making the stockpile near my workshops/stills not accept any barrels while having the stockpile near my farms accept barrel. The problem is the stockpile near my farms just end up keeping every single one of the plants in the barrels and my stupid dwarves won't move the plants individually over to the workshop/stills stockpile, even though the second was nowhere near full.2. Making neither stockpile accept plants. This works exactly how I would want my stockpiles to work - the plants near the workshops/stills remain undisturbed until a workshop uses it while the plants remain near my farms until the workshop/stills stockpile is no longer empty. The problem with this is that none of my plants are in barrels at all, so once my plant production ramps up I feel like I'm going to run out of space for plants. Also I feel like the plants might decay or something if they're not in a barrel for longer periods of time.3. Set both stockpiles to accept barrels. The problem is that my stupid dwarves take the ENTIRE BARREL from the workshops/stills stockpile just to move plants over from the farm stockpile. This makes it next to impossible to process plants/brew at a reasonable pace.If anyone knows any way I can set it up so that my plants go from farm -&gt; farm stockpile -&gt; workshops/stills stockpile -&gt; workshops/stills without the workshops/stills being interrupted by moving barrels, please tell me how. I'd even install some plugins/mods that lets me control hauling from stockpile to stockpile with more options or just makes the whole hauling process not brain-dead stupid.

Even listening to family members say words starting with a /w/, it sometimes sounds like a [v] to me. Everywhere I look, it says that the /w/ in Chinese is equivalent to the /w/ in English, such as the [w] in "want", but in my head a [w] in english sounds slightly different from the first sound in 活. Is there some weird phonemic difference between the English [w] and the Cantonese [w], or could it be something to do with my family's dialect of Cantonese? Or am I just going insane???

Also, a lot of my gaming time is spent on multiplayer games with already-low graphics, like LoL, Terraria (and other similar indie games), so building this will only be good for games like Borderlands 2. I do want to play games like GTA 5 and Fallout 4, but it'll take a while for them to go on sale, I'm in no rush to play them. This, combined with the fact that I don't have a permanent source of income, means I don't want to be spending too much.However, I want to be able to upgrade this computer as I get a more cash flow/free time (e.g. I graduate), so I want to build something that I can gradually upgrade without worrying about compatibility or having to replace everything. What are some key things I should be keeping in mind when looking for such an "upgradable" budget PC? Does it even matter what build I would be looking at for my needs, and if so, what kinds of builds should I be looking at?Sorry, I'm new to the whole build a PC thing, so if any of my questions/comments seem really stupid, don't hesitate to let me know :)

So for christmas this year, my girlfriend's dad (Mike) and I are putting our heads together and building an RC glider. He used to be an aviation mechanic / shop chief and fly RC planes and helicopters around all the time. He's older now, and not the richest man in the world. So I wanted to help fund a project that we'd both enjoy. I showed him the ardupilot some time ago and things began to take shape.    Now we plan to build the plane ourselves out of foam with wood for bracing from scratch. I know nothing about aviation, but he goes into great detail about cord length and how we'll be angling the wings up at x degrees so that it floats like a ship in the air. I am an industrial maintenance technician and have complete competence assembling and programming the equipment. Due to never working with planes as a hobby, I'm kind of out of my water when it comes to part selection though.    I know we'll be using the ardupilot. Probably the uBlox GPS as well. I need some help planning for the following parts:    Electric Motor  Propeller  Servos  Telemetry - does this include an accelerometer or other sensors?  Air speed  Anything else I'm lacking      I plan on documenting the build and posting it up here for everyone as a reference once we're finished. Links that could educate me on picking these components out myself would also be appreciated, but I'm really curious how everyone would build it themselves.  Our budget for the entire project is about $500-$600 USD. The ardupilot and uBlox GPS add up to about $280.  Thanks much

I started today and cut about 10' with the hatchet before my right arm felt like it was going to fall off. I have a long way to go and would like to get a decent arm/chest routine to help ease the work. I'm not looking for a workout routine that's going to make me look svelt, though I'm not avoiding it either.I'd like to stick with body weight exercises or dumbbell/ adjustable bench combos, but am open to any ideas where the gain would justify the purchase of new equipment.I'm about 2 years out of the Army and 4 years out of any real exercise. I'd like to use this as a springboard into getting back in shape, but I'm mostly interested in functional improvement right now.Thank you all ahead of time.

I simply am passionate about the gross misconduct of BoA's practices during the mortgage crisis.Today, I was able to move year-old car loan off of Bank of America's book and to another financial institution.  The best part: **MY MONTHLY PAYMENTS DECREASED BY $50**.  It's also worth noting that I did **NOT** increase the term of my loan and it will still be paid off in another 3.5 years.If I can do it.  YOU CAN TOO.

iuxef	-31517	1311178367	AskReddit	I need help with a PayPal/Ebay collection from 2006	A bit of back story:  In April of 2006 I sold a custom built desktop PC box to someone in Iowa for ~$700.  The buyer claimed the PC was damaged (it wasn't) and when I tried to claim the shipping insurance from the carrier-- the carrier claimed the package was not damaged.  When I received the returned PC, it was completely gutted and spare parts were thrown inside the box.I made a claim with PayPal/Ebay with the above information.  They did NOTHING to help and insisted I owe $700 (since the buyer was refunded the full amount).Fast-forward to a couple months later when I paid a collection agency $550 with the understanding that the balance was settled.Fast-forward to 2009 when ANOTHER collection agency is hitting me up for $200.  I disputed this and mentioned the previous payoff.  They then closed my account without payment from my part (this letter came from the VP of operations)Fast-forward to this week and ANOTHER collection agency is hitting me up for the cash.  I decide to contact PayPal directly (i had done so in the past, but they never had a collections division and couldn't help with the outstanding balance).  I inform Paypal that I STILL have an account with a positive balance and in good standing.  We go through the history of collection agencies and payments to confirm all of the above.  At the end, the PayPal agent said "the $550 was a settlement with the creditor, not us... you still owe us the money."QUESTION:  Being that this happened over 5 years ago, have this case exceeded the statute of limitations?  What are the consequences of non-payment?  In my mind, this account should have been settled long ago.**TL;DR I got ripped off on Ebay in 2006, paid a settlement to a collection agency. Does my current balance exceed the statute of limitations?**

It seems reddit has sparked a renewed interest in comic books when I discovered that Dark Horse was going to produce new comics based on the Firefly crew.  I feel as though I should have known there already existed Serenity comics and was able to obtain digital copies for viewing on my tablet device.Fast forward to now.  I need some suggestions for good reading material and hopefully a good investment collection-wise.  Does it make sense to buy 2 copies of each comic? One for reading and one for storage/collection?I think the ultimate situation would be to purchase a physical comic and  get a code to download a free digital copy.Alright, those specifics aside what would be some good material?  I love sci-fi and dystopian stories.  Anything Star Wars or Tron related would awesome as well.  I love Ridley Scott as well.Right now my renewed (and digital) collection is a bunch of Serenity comics, Killing Joke, and per another post, the Sandman series.I'm also lucky enough to have a comic store 3 miles away that has a pull-service that connects through comixology.

Several years ago, I had a custom audio installer replace the stock speakers in my CRV.  They also installed an older Kenwood head unit and amplifier from my old dodge setup.I'm not sure where the problem was, but I now have a blown speaker-- the head unit shit out on me-- and i debate the reliability of the amplifier.  So I currently have NO head unit (I literally have an ipod speaker dock wedged into that place hooked up the cigarette lighter power).  The amp is in place under the driver seat and all the high-quality speaker wire is run to the necessary areas.I'm no looking to install a crazy melt-your-face system.  I'm not even convinced I need a subwoofer.  I'm really just looking for a clean-sounding 4-speaker setup (speakers are in-door stock locations).  I'd like to be able to stream Google Music from my phone onto the stereo ... I prefer a double-din head unit.  Not sure how hard satellite radio setup is to obtain-- my buddy has one in his new Sonata and I like the Comedy Central channel.Bare minimum needs:Head Unit (double-din)4 speakers to go in stock locationsAmp that will match the speakersI'm hoping someone can offer a combo that will not blow my speakers out or melt the stock alternator.  I'd like it to be loud-ish, but i'm not trying to blow away the car next to me.bonus: point me in the direction of satellite radio (i literally know nothing about this)...  maybe a budget sub if there's room in the budget.I'd like to keep the total cost under $1,000.00, but realize some components cost money.thanks for helping out!

This is my 3rd year at our home and I never noticed an issue with the leaves on our tall bushes in the past.  They seem otherwise healthy and the higher up leaves seem unaffected.Is this a root fungus?  I originally thought it might have been some bugs munching on the leaves, but now i'm not sure.

2ddrej	-31517	1407884357	keto	Question about BPC and keto-smoothies?	So, i'm no stranger to the Keto lifestyle.  Several years ago I was pushing 300lbs and I dropped all the way to 230 or so.  I'm currently at 255 and been back at the keto-lifestyle for past couple of weeks.  I've been fasting in the mornings with bulletproof coffee.  1tbsp of kerrygold unsalted butter and 2tbsp of coconut oil.  I'll have that in the morning and then a 400 calorie lunch (lowcarb tortilla wrap, ham, salami, cheese, mustard).  I'm very good about using MFP and watching portions.So, due to some shakes and, even scarier, some heart palpatations.. I started supplementing with potassium... and ITS WORKING :)  However, I'm looking at ways to get more potassium naturally.  So I picked up some Silk unsweetened coconut milk.. spinach, green kale and strawberries.I have to experiment with food ratio of kale/spinach/strawberries... but i'm going to also add a scoop of protein powder (low carb of course).  I'm just not sure where to implement this "meal" into my routine.  I work in education, so blending a smoothie for lunch (ideal) I don't think is going to cut it.  I suppose I could blend the smoothie in the morning and then stick it in the fridge at work.. But  would this work?5:30am  kale/spin/straw/protein smoothie7:30am  BPC11:45am lunch3pm  snack6pm dinnerI'm not worried about the calories, but my understanding with the BPC is that it's only effective whilst fasting or following keto.Any thoughts? Thanks:)
2dsxbr	-31517	1408288083	StudentLoans	Married into 60k of student loan debt. I'm a math teacher in a Title I high school. What are our options?	As stated in the title, I married my lovely wife just over a year ago.  She is probably one of the few women I have met without any emotional baggage or drama.  Unfortunately, it came with a price tag of just over $60k in student loan debt.I've been teaching high school math for going on 6 years now in a Title I school-- so my job would qualify for loan repayment assistance.I think the major hurdle thus far is that my name simply is not on her loan and my understanding is that the govt. stopped allowing refi's with spouses due to sticky situations when divorce came into the picture.I don't expect to have the loan completely forgiven, but I cringe at the near-miss opportunity of potentially get $17k because of my job status.She recently took a job at the Clearbrook Center if that helps.  Our current debt repayment plan is a 10yr plan (120 payments) with 8 of those payments completed.Is it worth it to consolidate it privately and then hope congress passes a bill to refinance private loans federally?  I feel like that's our only best shot at some govt. cash.  Any solid advice would be greatly appreciated..

Looking for some new recommendations since I'm getting disturbingly close to the end of my reading list.My personal favorite ones would be, in no particular order (because I can't choose only one):* Letters from a Self-Made Merchant to His Son - Whoa, I finished it today and wrote at the very least some 25 notecards about the book, I could have done more but chose to save on a few parts where he repeats himself, it's chock-full of great advice for everyone, not only business owners/managers (although he is giving the perspective of one). It's free on project gutenberg too so there's not excuse not to read it* Meditations by Marcus Aurelius - I'm pretty sure most people know this book already, but if you don't, it's essentially a bunch of notes Marcus Aurelius wrote to himself as a reminder to stay humble. There's something to be said about that. (If you read it, go for Gregory Hays' translation)* The Warrior Ethos by Steven Pressfield - A little more unknown, it's very specific to how warrior tribes and warriors in general think and act. It goes into their ethics and code of honor. Quick and worthy read.
37da0j	-31529	1432670377	Calligraphy	Supplies in Germany?	I'm assuming there are at least a few of us in this subreddit, I recently (well, three days ago to be exact) started learning this wonderful art but have had some trouble finding online stores that carry the type of equipment I need. To be more specific, I had little trouble finding somewhat affordable ink (however if anyone can direct me to particularly cheap websites I won't complain) but when it comes to nib holders, apparently Germany doesn't know what an oblique one is. I found regular ones in my local Müller and some places on the internet but the cheapest oblique one I came across would be around 9€ including delivery and I'm not sure it's worth paying this much for such a basic holder. Can anyone recommend somewhere else?Worth mentioning I've read the wiki and used the search.

The catch is that the place where I'm living right now doesn't have anywhere to train TaiJi (there's little besides the university and it's not offered by them) so I would like to practice it alone.

Do you want to meet up along the way?Oh, as far as general athletic abilities go, I would place myself pretty much on the middle of the spectrum, I do sports/work out at least three/four times a week and go running twice, sometimes three.
3h81wb	-31529	1439749623	Svenska	Jag bodde i Sverige i ett år och kunde språket bra, nu, 2 år senare, har jag tappat bort dem flesta...	Mitt problem är att däremellan har jag lärt mig tyska och bor i Tyskland, så att alltid när jag försöker att säga något på svenska (som inte händer ofta, eftersom staden jag bor i är väldigt lite och jag känner inga svenskar/folk som kan språket runtomkring) kommer bara tyska ord fram. Det går fortfarande bra att skriva (trots jag fick använda google translate lite mer än jag ville), problemet är verkligen att prata och lyssna på språket. Mitt internet är också väldigt dåligt och det går inte att skypa ofta.Har någon ideen om hur man kan återvinna språket eller åtminstone prata vidare lite grann som det var?

1yxsn7	-31536	1393371590	DIY	Price of water heater + price of installation = :c	So, the question is... On a scale of 1 to don't even fucking try it, would it be worth my time and energy to replace the water heater on my own? The unit is 10 years old. My guess is it has never been serviced. It clunks. The pilot light doesn't stay on for longer than a few hours (thermocouple has been replaced). The water heater dude told me it's a problem with the gas valve, and due to the age of the unit that I should probably get a new one.So, I guess we have two thoughts:(1) Buy a gas valve and hope that works(2) Buy a water heater and install it myselfand (I guess) I have the option of paying an ungodly amount to have it replaced for me.

206jpp	-31536	1394579856	Teachers	A question involving the CCSS and High School English...	My department is struggling as of late, and it all circles back to the Common Core State Standards. Most of my department feels that it is absolutely important for each class in the grade level to be teaching the exact same text in the exact same way. Their belief is that if an administrator walks into one English 10 class they should see the exact same thing in another English 10 class.I couldn't disagree more.I feel that the CCSS allow teachers to use different novels, short stories, poems, and articles to teach the same *skills* as stated within the CCSS. So, if my fellow tenth grader English teacher wanted to teach *A Long Way Gone* to teach a certain skill that pertains to writing, I could use *The Great Gatsby* or short stories and excerpts from Dave Eggers to do the exact same thing.Does anyone else do this? How can I get my department, coordinator, and administration to understand this?

Apparently, this means I am fantastic at the "lecturing" part of being a teacher. I depart wisdom onto my students through lessons and presentations. The problem? Well, my students often rely on what I say rather than speaking up and creating their own ideas. So, I have been told to become more of a "guide on the side." As summer is nearly upon us, I've decided that perhaps I need to add a book or two to my summer reading list that may help me focus the classroom on student discussion and creating a more "student-centered" classroom. So, I've come to ask if anyone has any recommendations for texts? I've heard good things about *Never Work Harder Than Your Students*, but I am not sure if this is the book I should read. Thoughts? Thanks, friends! (And remember... Only a few short weeks left!)
254nf8	-31536	1399644377	VisitMontreal	Planning a possible short trip from NH to Montreal from June 14th to June 16th	I know this is really short, but my wife and I are taking a trip to the New England area (Boston two days, New Hampshire two days), and the last three days were going to be spend in Maine. However, we just noticed that Arcadia National Park is 5+ hours from Meredith, NH whereas Montreal is 4+ hours. And thus, we thought, why the hell not Montreal?So, I know three days is probably not enough, but is it enough to see some awesome things? What should we absolutely do? We love good food, good beer, and awesome non-touristy experiences. (I saw there was a Fringe festival, and that sounds awesome.) The Cirque show in Old Harbor sounds pretty cool.Is it worth the three days we'd spend?

We adopted her on Saturday and are absolutely in love.I've got some time before I go back to work, so I am currently trying to work on getting her to enjoy her long-term confinement area. She's seems totally fine in her kennel (her short-term confinement). She often goes into it without us asking her to, *and* sleeps the night in there. (Huge plus!) But when we put her in her long-term area to practice, she HOWLS and barks and makes sounds like a little monkey. She quiets down if she sleeps or if she is eating, but once that is over, it all returns. We wanted to use the long-term area as she will (soon) be alone for 8 hours during the day. Her long-term area (seen in the background of the pic) is the bathroom complete with her kennel, water, toys, and a potty pad.Any ideas about how to get her to like this space?

For some of the newer players, I'd like to give you a couple resources to help you get to know our beloved universe.[TES Podcast Series](http://elderlore.wordpress.com/episodes/season-one/) [Pocket Guide to the Lore - Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AtsWXZKVqB4Q825_SwINY6z4_9NaGknXgeOknOCDuCU/edit?pli=1)/r/tesloreEDIT: Here are some? Here's some? Can't grammar right now.

I'd like to play more games on higher graphics settings. Older games I can play with little issue, but I feel as if I can still improve with what I have. I just replaced my old gfx with my current one, so I'm thinking maybe upgrading to 8gig. I have little room with processors to work with unfortunately, it seems the processor socket isn't really made anymore. What would you all consider doing to this rig?

25nmrr	-31537	1400186284	hockeyplayers	What's your pregame routine (Drinks, stretches, warms-ups)?	Over the years, I've been trying to master my pregame routine. I've been through different ranks, from House, to High School and to AAA, but each team gives me a new idea of what I should do. Now being a little older and a weekend warrior (mid 20s beer leaguer) my pregame routine has become I think even more important. Not only will a good pregame help me out during my skates and give me the most out of them, but they also prevent injury, which I just can't afford.So what's your pregame routine? Mine right now is:-Foam roller on my legs before I leave the house-Stop at the gas station and pick up a black coffee and a light blue Gatorade-Drink coffee on the way and while I get dressed-Play game

Right now I can clear 41-42 with little trouble.My question is about gear stats.At times I get an ancient piece of gear that is has less % damage on it (maybe by 2-3%) but has more int. Usually caused by crit chance rolls.Should I be going for highest sheet damage possible, in doing so sometimes using non-ancients over their ancient counterparts?Or should I be going for full ancient for more +Int on the gear, but less sheet damage.

I work in a smallish newsroom filled with middle aged women who don't respect me and I always feel like I'm on thin ice.

I've always wanted to travel and feel like this would also be great life experience for me. My dad on the other hand is totally against the idea, saying that I'm currently in a great job at the moment and using my degree, unlike most people who were in my class. What should I do?

I'm only after graduating college and don't have any real travel experience. I'm stuck in an office all day full of middle aged women who have no respect for me and my boss always makes me feel like I'm on thin ice. I have to get up at 5.30 every morning and do a shit load of work over the weekends for no extra cash. Should I try and stick out my job for another year or pack everything in and say goodbye?Also I should have mentioned that I have an extraordinary amount of student debt to pay, and if I go I will leave my parent's to pay my weekly fees.

I'm a full time journalist who works very long hours each day. I've been living with my unemployed girlfriend now for 3 months and more or less things are going great. She has a degree in accounting but hasn't managed to get a job yet. I'm cool with this as my earnings get us by (just about) each month. However, she doesn't do a lick of work in the house when I'm gone and refuses to cook for me when I get home each day. She, instead wants to split the chores 50/50 between us but I think this is unfair because I work so hard each day at my job and am exhausted by the time I get home. She gets very angry when I try and reason with her and accuses me of acting like a 1950's husband. If she had a job, then I would be more than happy to split the household tasks but as for now I think she should do them. Do I have a reason to be upset or does she have a point?**tl;dr**: My unemployed gf accuses me of being a 1950's husband because I want to her to cook and clean for me. 
3ebhvp	-31541	1437656948	relationships	Should I [M25] choose the dream job or stay with my boyfriend [M23]?	My boyfriend and I have been living together for 2 years now. He is the best thing that has ever happened to me and I love him dearly.I have been working in a local newspaper for 2 years as a news journalist and travel writer. I work very extremely hard at this low paid job (€19K per year) and do not get the appreciation I deserve. My boss has also announced that there will be redundancies in the next few months. Anyway, I applied for the position as a travel editor for this really upmarket world-wide travel company. I sent off my CV and the next day I got a reply saying that I would be the perfect candidate for the role but I would have to work in the company's headquarters in Germany (Holzwickede, opposite Dortmund airport).  They said they will cover my travel fees and make the transition as smooth as possible if I accept the job. My BF, however, is currently is awaiting to graduate from college and is not in a position to leave Ireland until early November. He got very upset when I told him about this job and started crying, accusing me of wanting to break up with him. I don't want to break up with him but at the same time I really want to breakaway from journalism and switch to a new field. The thought of living in another country, especially Germany, also really excites me. I would really appreciate some advice people. **tl;dr**: Got a very well paid job as a travel editor in Germany. BF cannot leave Ireland and does not want me to go.

3hbmi1	-31541	1439823918	ireland	Anyone want to help this horse named Peanut win the 'Nose' of Tralee?	So apparently there's a Rose of Tralee for animals and this year a dog from Kerry is in the lead with 13.6K votes. If you take a look at the finalists you can see that every one of them are dogs with the exception of the Mayo Nose who is a white horse named Peanut with only 736 results so far. Word on the street is that the other dogs look down on Peanut and mock him just because he is different. The Carlow Nose even called him an underprivileged donkey.Why don't we all do Peanut a favour and show him our love by voting for him before the competition ends tomorrow (August 18) at 8pm. We don't have a lot of time so let's all vote for the ~~underdog~~ underhorse and spread the word.https://petsittersireland.com/nose-of-tralee/final/

2h2js0	-31556	1411337129	tifu	TIFU by dropping my pipe.	This happened a few weeks ago when I met up with my friend to have a nice little smoke session.  As I left my house to meet him I made sure I had my bare essentials (phone, wallet, keys, weed, pipe, lighter) and I realized I left my pipe in the backyard.  No big deal.  I walk back into the house, grab my pipe, and jump in the car.  I didn't bother putting the pipe in my pocket or in any compartment in my car (this is important) and I drive to the gas station to get some gas before heading to my friends house.  I get to the gas station, park next to the pump, and as I got out I heard a loud glass-shattering sound.  The pipe was on my lap.  Luckily no one was around and the attendant was inside the little mini market.  I walk into the market to pay for my gas thinking that this dude must have heard something but nope, he didn't mention a thing to me.  As I walked to my pump I suddenly heard 3-4 loud tire-puncturing sounds. I look up and notice its an old lady driving in a beat up toyota tercel.  I immediately think "fuck this person must have driven over the thick pieces of glass that are still on the floor".  I was so embarrassed I just wanted to pump my gas and leave.  The old lady must have not heard the sound of her tires popping because she walked to the market to pay for her gas and didn't even glance at her car.  As I'm finishing up pumping my gas I begin to hear her tires slowly lose air realized that I just popped two of her tires.TLDR: popped an old lady's tires @ a gas station and drove off without saying a thing :(

Well it didn't last long but I fell asleep around 1Am woke up at 8Am because I'm going to a concert today, but I didn't remember my dream at all. I fell back asleep a short while after, what I remember was getting dressed and getting into the car with my GF. After a little of driving I noticed a tornado behind us, it seemed so real at the time. I said in my dream "this can't be real I must be dreaming". I then tried to  count my fingers but I remember seeing at least 8 fingers on each hand. Then I said "I'm lucid dreaming" I looked back up and the tornado was right behind us and it felt like I was being sucked in. Then my GF woke me up at 9:30Am and said the concert was canceled due to rain. Sorry for a boring story but that hour of dreaming felt so different then normal.

30rg4c	-31569	1427680637	NoFap	NoFap Recap: Week 1	I cannot remember the last time I consciously tried to refrain from PMO or MO for a full week and succeeded. It's been almost two years since I entered a new city and a new phase in my life. When I first arrived here I had about 200 days behind me and was feeling great. Now as I pack my things and prepare to move to yet another new city to take on yet another great adventure the timing seems right. Blast off, fapstronauts. Blast off!The first three days weren't too troublesome. The weekend came and it presented several opportunities to jump on a 3d chat software (my personal weakness) and engage in some roleplay. I miss creating an avatar and talking to random strangers. I think the escapism allows me to run from a lot of my worries and insecurities. But I haven't broken yet and I think I'll be fine for tonight. Once the week starts up I hope the fast-pace will keep my mind off of chatting.Refraining from porn has been pretty easy. Television shows with explicit content can trigger me. I'm not really seeking them out to tease myself yet, which is good. But when you get hit unexpectedly that is something that can really ruin a streak. Luckily the triggers haven't been too strong. As I look forward to next week and the promise of double-digit-days on my badge I am concerned about a few things: First, this becomes the stage where messing up the streak really hurts because it feels like you really lost something. Relapse at 3 days? Eh, so what, I can get that back. 10 days though...that was hard work. Second, the triggers thus far have been pretty weak. I can imagine hitting a tough trigger this week and having a real challenge in front of me. Finally, it seems like a lot of stress will be building up around work and that can create some ideal conditions for breaking the streak. Managing stress will be crucial.I now invite you to recap your week in the comments, ask questions, or keep the good vibes going!

Looking for advice on a good neighbourhood to stay in (thinking either hotel or checking out airbnb), restuarants, and watering holes to visit while I putz around what looks to be a nice little city. I've read what's already been posted and most of it relates to stuff months/years ago so not sure how relevant it is.Would love to catch some live music or other fun local type events. I'm really game for anything. I love bourbon, guitary music (Black Keys, Avett Brothers, etc) but also go electronic for a good dance party - probably not what I'll be in the mood for there though.Where do you guys go out? Is it cool for me to walk around at night? Places/neighbourhoods to avoid? Or do you have something fun planned that I can tag along to or feel like showing a relatively friendly chick around the town?Thanks for any and all advice!

That white mini-van is smack in the middle of the road. Not only that, he double parked me and caused me to be stuck for 3 hours while security did nothing but try to page the owners of the double parked cars.  I realize the parking lines are hardly visible, but if you get out of your car and see that you've trapped someone between your car and another, something is wrong!   None of the cars that were double parked ever moved before we were able to squeeze out horizontally because some other cars moved beside us.  The moral of the story is, park anywhere you like at Six Flags cause security can't do jack about it.

He doesn't seem to do this throughout the Netflix show. Some of the fights that he gets seriously injured in takes place at night and it seems like he could've easily won if he just cut the power first. Does he ever do this in the comics or would that just give away the fact that he's blind and he doesn't want people knowing that? His costume covers his eyes and doesn't seem transparent so I wouldn't think that would be a sensitive issue...  I am not familiar with any of his other works so thanks for any insight.

25jjsx	-31614	1400080408	frenchhelp	[Correction] Are there any mistakes or illogical sentences?	I had to write something about the book "Il faut sauver Saïd" and I would really appreciate if someone could look over it! Thanks a lot!Le livre s’agit d’un jeune garçon, dont son talent scolaire est entravé par le nouveau collège et son frère Abdelkrim, qui croule de plus en plus dans la criminalité. La question est de savoir si Saïd peut être délivré de sa situation pénible.L’histoire de Saïd est très intéressant et émouvant. Différentes couches sociales sont présentés et on gagne un aperçu d’une situation, que nous ne connaissons pas. C’est consternant de voir que sa famille, particulièrement son père, n’essaye pas d’aider Saïd, qui est presque sur son propre.Parce qu’il se comporte très adulte, on oublie, que Saïd a seulement onze ans. C’est très impressionnant qu’il voie tous les problèmes, qui l’entourent, pendant son père s’intéresse seulement à la télé.Une chose, qui m’a choqué beaucoup est la dureté du Tarek. Bien que Abdelkrim soit le cousin de Tarek, il le traite comme un ennemi en le assommant brutalement aux yeux de son petit frère. Un autre moment dans lequel on voit sa cruauté est quand il menace de faire mal à Samira.Mais le livre montre la situation aussi de l’autre côté. Par exemple, c’est beau de voir qu’il y a certains personnes, qui prennent soin de lui. En particulier Antoine et son père et les professeurs Madame Beaulieu et Monsieur Théophile.Malheureusement, je ne comprends pas pourquoi Saïd n’a pas répondu Antoine. Il aurait été beau s’il s’était efforcé de maintenir l’amitié avec Antoine, parce que c’est pas de sa faute qu’il a dû changé d’école.L’histoire est refraîchissant en tout cas. Le livre se compose d’entrées de journal, qui font la lecture plus excitante et facile. Il faut un peu du temps jusqu’à ce qu’on soit impliqué dans l’histoire, mais ensuite, tout est compréhensible et on se peut mettre à la place de Saïd.Bien que il s’agisse de quelque chose sérieuse, le conte n’est pas formé trop dramatiquement. Ça monte, que l’histoire est raconté par un enfant et pas par un auteur, qui veut l’outrer. La fin est très touchante, malgré que ce soit beaucoup simple. On peut dire que la fin est ouverte, mais on sait que l’histoire se termine positivement, pour Mounir et pour Saïd. Probablement, c’est Monsieur Théophile qui cherche à sauver Saïd, mais peut-être aussi sa sœur Samira.En fait, c’est très triste que l’histoire ne soit pas tout simplement inventé. La situation de Saïd est encore courante et majeure. Comme Brigitte Smadja a dit, l’école est malade et pas seulement dans un endroit. C’est important qu’on soit donné l’éveil à tous ces élèves qui sont dans une telle circonstance et peut-être pareils livres aident à améliorer ce problème.Oui, la livre vaut la lecture. Brigitte Smadja réussit à emballer un problème sérieux dans une histoire bien racontée et simple, sans perdre la profondeur du sujet.

2gkvvc	-31614	1410890182	AskCulinary	Why, for example, is the basic ratio to bake bread 5 parts flour and 3 parts water?	Hi /r/askculinary !I've been doing some research about the chemistry of baking and one part of that are ratios. I've read the book *Ratio: The Simple Codes Behind the Craft of Everyday Cooking* by Michael Ruhlman.To bake bread you need 5 parts flour, 3 parts water, salt and yeast. But what is the science behind the 5:3? Does it have a stoichiometric explanation or does the ratio 5:3 just give the best results?I know that you can change some things, like more butter when making cookies to increase their spread, but how did people figure out the basic ratios? With experimenting?Thanks a lot!

Is it true that the mass ratio from N2 and 3H2 equals 4,6?

3i35g7	-31614	1440343679	zurich	Prospective student here, really need a place to live. Any recommendations and/or advice?	Hi /r/zurich I'm starting as a student this Semptember at the ETH Zürich. Currently, I'm living with my parents, which is sadly close to impossible (long story).I have a part-time job as a waitress (hourly wage of 20 francs, so the maximum wage of one day is around 120 francs).For the last few months I've been searching for different possibilities to move out and to live in Zürich (or Rapperswil). I've found one bedroom apartments for around 800.-, WG-Rooms under 700.- and of course studenthouses with rooms ranging from 300 to 700.-. What I'd really like would be a "Zwecks-WG", it's like a commune but just for the purpose of having a cheap living place. Basically, it's perfect for introverts.So, what do you think? What should/can I do, what would be the best choice? For example, I know renting a little apartment would include a lot of paperwork and additional costs, so I think that wouldn't be a good idea. Or does any of you have something specific?I appreciate every bit of help and/or advice. Thanks!

33916p	-31622	1429548473	LucidDreaming	It Finally Happened, Sadly	After two years of reading about lucid dreaming, it finally happened to me. I was hoping for an event where I would be able to take control of the situation, but the truth is that you're only given a choice in what happens. In my case; I was being attacked by strange people/zombies/monsters. Stuck in a shack, there was someone on the right (where the door opened) and the things took over that person. It was at that moment I realized that personal dictation of belief decides nothing in dreaming. In that instance I pointed the shotgun towards myself and all I saw was black. I've contemplated ending my life before, but after seeing what I did when I was 'in-control' of existence in that scenario, nah (I'm happy to tell you what I saw, but I don't want to blurt that perspective I had out) . It would never be worth it. It was my actions in that lucid dream that turned it into a nightmare.

Hello /r/leagueoflegends!Now, I'm not sure how this will be received, but I would like to have an open forum concerning the sexism existing in almost all of the threads concerning the all-female League teams.It seems that most posts involving them tend to spin out into a men vs. women argument about rights for each gender. It tends to get fairly vicious and offensive. I'd like to delve into the minds of the gamers in this sub to understand exactly where these emotions come from.I consider myself a feminist and have found that the level of education in the sub isn't the highest in terms of gender-friendly conversations. I would like to do my best to mediate and understand the perspectives of every one who participates in this thread.Now, I ask you all. What are your thoughts on these all-female teams? Why do you think there has been such a huge backlash to their publicity? Where do these sexist remarks such as 'they're only here because they have tits' and 'if a guy team did the same, no one would care' stem from? I thank you all for your participation and am excited to learn about my fellow gamers, both  male and female.

I realize that an electric piano would be best suited for the place, in terms of space, but I would like to look at the option of having an upright in my apartment. What are the options for rentals in Japan? Thank you all so much!

He and I are both big into League and were wondering what the scene was like here in Japan. We are looking to climb the ranks in S4 and currently play on the NA server until Japan server comes.Basically, it is hard for us to get a team together simply because of the time difference between Japan and NA. I'd like to toss out a general discussion about this or anything else this thread might inspire!

I figured since Naruto is so popular in the states, that I could find some interesting things...Unfortunately, it seems like Naruto isn't really well-liked here. Everything (and I mean everything) seems to be dominated by One Piece. KFC signs, makeup bags, pencil cases, everything is One Piece. To be fair, I did find a cup of Naruto Ramen. That was pretty cool. Thoughts about this? Does anyone else live in Japan and can shed some light on this or even in other countries outside of the US?
1srxeq	-31628	1386910606	japan	The Social Environment of an ALT (JET) in Japan.	I am currently an ALT in the JET program. The time for renewing our contracts is at hand and, being a first year, I am having a difficulty deciding what to do. I would like to know the perspectives of the other ALTs who have either been here for a while or are first years like me.I find myself a bit dissatisfied with the social environment of the JET program. It seems to be expected that I spend a lot of time with the other ALTs and am greeting with a bit of confusion when I say I would rather spend some time alone. To be quite honest, I find little in common with the other ALTs besides the fact that we are all foreigners.It feels quite shallow and forced, which I do not like in the least. I don't exactly know what it is, but I feel so separated from them. I have spent time with some of my Japanese friends and have had a blast and yet, whenever I spend time with the ALTs, it feels much less meaningful. I am a bit older than the college-fresh members, so I wonder if that plays a part of it.To all of the ALTs out there, could you let me know how you feel about the JET program? What are your social lives like? Why am I made  to feel guilty for wanting my privacy and alone time? I was told that culture shock was going to be a problem. I just didn't realize the culture shock was going to come from the members of the JET program and not from Japan itself. I have no problems with the cultures of the country. I have a problem with the expectations and social obligations my ALT peers seem to be pushing on me.I guess I am not the kind of person to jump into the "XXXXX-Prefectural ALT Relay Race Festival"-type facebook events. I feel like there is something deeper I am looking to learn from Japan. The interests of the other ALTs seem to differ greatly from my own, thus creating a sort of interest gap. As a musician, I find myself more interested in traditional music and the arts in Japan rather than how many times I can visit Kyoto or whether I can bicycle from one prefecture to the next.TL;DR I find the ALT social and "support" group to be shallow and undesirable. What are your thoughts?EDIT: I am not upset or offended at all by the invitations. By all means, if I am in the mood, I will hang out with my alt friends. I am nowhere near impersonal or cold.  I just don't like it when I turn an invitation down, I receive negative responses and multiple questions such as, "Well, what are you going to do then?" or "Where are you going instead?". I prefer to keep my private life private, but it seems as though being a part of JET is not unlike living in a glass fishbowl. Thank you for your advice everyone! I do feel much more comfortable living my life here in Japan for my personal and professional development as well as the cultural immersion. I will definitely take it at my own pace.

Thank you all for being so supportive in the past and I hope to give you quality content in the future! Here is my channel if you would like to get an idea of the type of style I play.

2bg1iv	-31628	1406072898	classicalguitar	Buckling down and taking my art seriously. Advice needed.	I have been out of college for about four years now. Having been a music student, I left college with ample experience, but I found that I let that somewhat go to waste. I have casually continued to play guitar, but had no real aim or purpose.I would like to get back on track and actively improve my skills as a guitarist. Most of my repertoire was classical and flamenco, but most of it has fallen out of my memory. I love the Spanish-sounding pieces and would like to rebuild my list of pieces.Where can I start? As a bit of background, I have a music degree, can obviously read music and have probably an intermediate level of skill in playing. I live in Japan currently, so obtaining music books is a bit hard for me (I am not in range of a music store, but can buy things off of Amazon). Any sort of lead on how to get back into this and taking guitar seriously would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much everyone! Sorry for the long post.

It is mainly the violin sections.As someone new to the DAW scene, what sort of knobs and such am I going to have to look at to change the string sections into sounding more realistic? I know it isn't a simple as assigning an instrument to the MIDI line and letting the program do it's work.

Maybe smaller motives and themes, working with repetition...Any advice on how to break myself of this habit?

Sometimes it is only one track, sometimes it is multiple.Keyboard input still produces sound and everything, but it seems like the MIDI lines aren't producing anything despite being visually reponsive. (Even the volume meters aren't moving, so I know that I am not simply missing out on a setting...)Any ideas on what to do?

Silence can oftentimes signal the loudest voice of agreement."This is genuinely very frightening. To think that men go out into the world with this perspective is something that disturbs me more than a lot of the other things I have seen on the internet. This is my first time posting to r/thebluepill simply because this statement seemed too intense not to share.It was from this thread:http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3b4tho/guy_on_rtinder_spits_truth_about_the_brutal/

Hello everyone!I currently live in Kyushu so I am no stranger to Japan...however, I am indeed a stranger to Okinawa. I know little about the island past the few things I am interested in seeing (such as the aquarium). I have heard that it is relatively difficult to get around Okinawa without a car, so I am a bit worried.Details of the trip:Our hotel is in Naha simply because it is close to the airport and we didn't want to risk anything getting messed up. I know most people have said to stay away from Naha, but I got a pretty good deal.What's the best way to get around? What sort of traveling budget should I estimate for a week in Okinawa? Are bikes reliable?Any nice things to do or see here that couldn't be found on websites about Okinawa? My friend and I are really into finding beautiful serene beaches, so any leads would be appreciated. Also, any small festivals going on?Thanks in advance!

3eefyd	-31628	1437705890	japanlife	Summer clothing for a large man (Kyushu)	I am going to Okinawa and have been trying to find clothes for summer (swimsuits, shorts, shirts, etc.)For shirts, it is not terribly difficult to find things at Uniqlo, H&amp;M, etc...but for shorts and swimsuits, I am shit out of luck. The LL size doesn't fit comfortably around my thunderthighs or my curvaceous posterior.Where can a bottom-heavy gentleman such as myself find shorts that will fit reasonably? I will be stopping in Fukuoka to fly out, so I think that would be a prime place to look for clothing (my city doesn't have the widest selection). Would shopping IN Okinawa be too much procrastination?Thank you!
3fy6si	-31628	1438824300	metalgearsolid	Best way to catch up in the storyline before MGS4?	My friend is visiting for a while and we wanted to play MGS4 together because she has always wanted to get into the series. We are currently playing through MGS3, but probably won't have time for three more full games.Is there any youtube channel that can cover the story of MGS 1 and 2 enough to be adequately up to date for MGS4? Thanks!EDIT: Just for clarification. She and I wanted to enjoy Metal Gear together, which was the point of us playing through with each other. We simply do not have time to play through all four games, so I figured 3 and 4 are some of the more impactful installments in the series. Sure, she can read and do stuff on her own, but we were hoping to do as much as we could together before she departs for her home country. I hope that makes sense!

The problem is that there is about a 10 second delay coming from Twitch (because I currently live in Japan). I have tried to read up on how to fix this, but it seems as though the delay is something that cannot be removed.That being said, is there any way I can stream my ps4 directly to my friend's computer? Is there anything outside of twitch that will allow me to do this? That way, I can communicate with my friend as I am playing. Any help would be great, thank you!

After two years here, I have realized that Japanese doctors are a bit lacking in the efficiency department.I have had a back problem for the past year. I went to the largest hospital in my town and a few clinics and got some x-rays. The places said they couldn't see anything wrong. I eventually made my way to a sports clinic where the doctor discovered that I had a lumbar disc inflammation.Now, the treatment the doc gave me consisted of pills (weak) and compresses. He has scheduled rehabilitation, but it is pretty much just me sitting for 10 mins while suction cups shoot electricity into my back.I worry that I am wasting my time and money since my case isn't improving. I have communicated with the doc about the pain being consistent and he has simply said, "Well, let's keep doing rehabilitation."Is there anything I can do? I would love to be able to sit and stand without pain. The inflamed lumbar disc is giving me hell. If anyone has had this type of medical experience in Japan, I would appreciate any advice! Thanks in advance!

She's finally quit, which honestly couldn't make me happier.3 - Weird story? I'll answer if someone actually asks, it's a long one. And I have lots of them haha.4 - Was the prostitute I worked for hot? If I did not know she was still a prostitute, I would still not have sex with her. She was kind of bigger (not fat, just bigger) and had like white-blonde hair. Not my thing.5 - Do other prostitutes on the forums do the same thing? Yes, but not all.

pd19u	-31634	1328524199	trees	Just wanted to share something that I thought was pretty awesome	Hey guys, I've been lurking trees for a while now and finally feel like I have something to say haha. I need to give a little background about myself first, though. I'm a pre-medical student in my 2nd to last term of college; gonna be done this spring. I'm currently taking organic chemistry + lab, and physics + lab. It's a hell of a lot of work, but I love this stuff. I aspire to be a cardiothoracic surgeon one day, because I genuinely want to help people (&lt;3'ing science a whole bunch certainly helps). Anyway, I just wanted to tell you guys about the way I use my trees to help me in school. I have a physics test tomorrow, and spent the whole day, entirely sober, practicing problems, learning the equations, understanding concepts, etc. I took the practice test, did all the reading, got everything done. Of course, toking it up a little is a lot more appealing than sitting in your room all day studying, its just what I reward myself with. So then I DO end up smoking, and now I've just been thinking about everything I've learned. It seriously went from these seemingly random, unrelated things (that ~~was~~ I was entirely capable of doing, just not really understanding the science behind it), to a perfectly interconnected web of understanding. I thank my little trees for helping me really grasp the "why" behind all of the stuff I'm doing. Love you guys!Edit: Grammar...

15sp4j	-31638	1357086637	eldertrees	Is there a good all encompassing stoner/drug music subreddit?	I've checked out /r/treemusic and I just don't like the musical preferences over there.  It's too much of the Bonnaroo scene and radio friendly pop music for my taste.  I'd be into something similar to /r/TrueMetal for music made by people who are out of their minds on drugs.  I really dig stoner metal like Sleep (Dopesmoker is the best song ever in my opinion), heavy psych (Acid Mothers Temple), drone, doom, krautrock (Can), ambient, space rock (Hawkwind), shoegaze, old funk (Maggot Brain!), jazz (Sun Ra) and reggae stuff.  I'd like to avoid things like Bob Marley, Phish, Grateful Dead, Sublime, Pink Floyd, jam/folky bands and the similar; I know a lot of people love that music but it's everywhere and not in my interest.I know there are subreddits for all that but it would be cool if there was a place for all of it instead of subscribing to 15 subreddits that will clog up my news and whatnot.Update: I found what I'm looking for thanks to [thedeven](http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/15sp4j/is_there_a_good_all_encompassing_stonerdrug_music/c7pudel), but we can still talk about jams if'n you want to.Update 2: If you care, I made a playlist on another rad site i just found called [Reddit Playlister](http://redditplayer.phoenixforgotten.com/?r=postrock+FUZZROCK+dreampop+darkambientmusic+dark_ambient+Ambientmusic+psychrock+Neopsychedelia+psychout+classicpsych+PsychedelicRock+drone+Shoegaze+SpaceMusic+monsterfuzz+stonermetal+stonerrock+spacerock+krautrock) that you can check out and randomize all the stuff from the different music subreddits I combined.  You can also just check out the multi-reddit I made [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/spacerock+stonerrock+stonermetal+monsterfuzz+truemetal+krautrock+SpaceMusic+Shoegaze+drone+PsychedelicRock+classicpsych+psychout+Neopsychedelia+psychrock+Ambientmusic+dark_ambient+darkambientmusic+dreampop+postrock+fuzzrock).  I haven't gone through them all yet to find which are updated and worth keeping, and I'll probably add more as I find them, but it's a good place to start.Part 3, The Return of the Son of - I just found of that the Reddit Player has an [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rplaylister.rplaylisterandroid), this rules so hard, I can make playlists of any combo of music subreddits and shuffle them to my phone. This is all working out so well...

175ova	-31638	1358987364	AskHistorians	Did the Mongol Empire change the conquered populations racially?	Before Genghis Khan the Mongol people were nomadic and isolated, if I understand correctly. Now there are estimates that .5% of the world is a carries the genes of Genghis Khan.  How did the spread of the Mongolians genetic material, from a relatively small area to such an enormous area, in such a short time change the genetic make up of the rest of the world.  I know the Mongols didn't have much impact of the conquered people culturally, but did the conquered people change appearance wise from how they looked before the Mongols came?  I'm especially interested in Europeans.

[Oakland, CA]	One and a half years ago my girlfriend got a parking ticket in Oakland for $50, we were just passing through, we are not CA residents.  A week or two later she called the number to pay the fine and was told she had no ticket, she double checked to make sure she owed the city no money, they said no.  Afterwards she notices they wrote the wrong license plate number (and color I believe), so she figured it was a stroke of good luck, end of story.  Cut to a few days ago she gets a collections notice in the mail, they figured out who she was and where she lived and the fine has been tripled. Is there any way to defend herself from the extra fines considering she tried to pay it and was told there was nothing to pay?  She doesn't own the car anymore, just in case that matters for some reason.

The art was kinda abstract or psychedelic and [looked a bit like this style.](http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ch.1.png) The story was a sci-fi or fantasy type about different gods and aliens, I believe it may have been some kind of god-like family of beings.

I recently had my annual pap, and my results came back abnormal.  I've never had an abnormal pap or a colposcopy, so I was kind of nervous.  My gynecologist offered to let me see my cervix through a camera while he was putting the acetic acid on it to look at the cells, which I thought was super cool.  I have an IUD, so it was awesome to actually be able to see the strings for the first time.  He walked me through everything he was doing and what everything meant during the entire procedure.  It was REALLY great.  I told him I appreciated the science lesson, and he said that he thought I would (he knows I'm an engineer) and that doctors should also be teachers.I do have HPV, but the colposcopy showed that there's not enough abnormality to be concerned about at this point.I walked out of that appointment feeling a whole lot better than I did going into it. **TL;DR:  I got to watch my colposcopy through a camera; my gynecologist is awesome**

I'm 5'4", F, currently at about 145 lbs, started at 170.  Ultimate goal is 125.I have always been super comfortable with my body, even at my heaviest.  I never let being chubby hold me back, and I never let it bother me.  25 pounds down, and I'm more critical of my body than I've ever been.  Every time I look in the mirror I feel like crying, even though nearly every one of my friends and co-workers has commented on how great I look.  Plus, I have an awesome boyfriend who tells me I look sexy/pretty/beautiful multiple times a day.Does anyone else have a more negative image of yourself after losing weight than you did before losing?  I just can't understand it, and it's really getting me down.  Advice appreciated!

I love you guys, and would really like some words of wisdom from other industry women.I've been working at my first full-time engineering job since the end of June.  I was fortunate enough to get hired months ahead of graduation, but I've mostly been doing easy, small projects since I started.  My boss just took me into his office and gave me an ENORMOUS project to complete from start to finish.  Everything from permitting to purchase orders to finding contractors to appropriating equipment to overseeing the actual construction.  While I know it's quite the honor to finally be trusted with a big, important project, I feel like I have NO IDEA what I'm doing.  I'm the only girl in the engineering department where I work, and I'm so afraid of failing and having it be blamed on my gender.  Actually, I'm just afraid of failing in general.Lady engineers/science-y/career-y women, how did you handle your first projects on the job?  Did you have any clue what you were doing, and if not how the heck did you deal with being overwhelmed?I know I was hired by this company for a reason (I was an intern with them and they loved me), but it feels like someone just threw me into deep waters without teaching me to swim first.EDIT:  You guys rock.  Thanks for all the amazing advice.  I will try to calm down and sort things out with lists, coworkers, and breathing.  :)

sfwc0	-31642	1334752107	loseit	Together, my best friend and I have lost almost 100 pounds combined!  Progress pic inside.	Hi LoseIt!First of all, I'd just like to say how amazing y'all are.  I discovered Reddit &amp; r/loseit shortly after I started my weight loss journey, and this community has been nothing but motivational, inspirational, and supportive.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.I've been hesitant to show you guys progress pictures because I wanted to be 100% "done" with my transformation before I did.  I am close to my goal weight, but I've realized that my body transformation may never really be "done".  I want to make my body as awesome as it can be and push my physical limits, and that might take me the rest of my life.  Both my friend and I have been struggling a little lately keeping up with our new healthy lifestyle, so she put these two pictures next to each other last night and it made me realize how far we both have come.  So, I had to share!  :)[HERE](http://i.imgur.com/cDRiD.jpg) is our progress!  The first picture was taken two years ago on my birthday (I am on the left in both pictures).  The second picture was taken this past weekend.**Our stats:**  I am 5'4" and 23 years old; I started at 170(ish) lbs and am now 128(ish) lbs.  My ultimate goal weight range is 118-120 lbs and/or to have a flat tummy.  She is 5'2" and 24 years old; she started at 210 lbs and is now 155 lbs.  I'm not sure what her ultimate goal is, but she is focusing on losing another 20 lbs right now.**How we did it:**  I started Weight Watchers last August on a whim because I had seen some of my friends on Facebook have success with it, and WW were having a promotional deal.  My friend started shortly after I did.  I quit WW after the three months I paid for expired and started counting calories with MyFitnessPal.  My friend is still doing WW, but is also counting calories.  We both have not been consistent with exercise for the duration of our weight loss, but I have been consistently lifting (Starting Strength) for about a month now and love it.I'll be happy to answer any other questions, but I will be out of the office for most of the day and may not get to them until this evening. My friend is not a redditor, but I am pretty familiar with her journey as well as my own (I asked permission to post this, don't worry).Love you guys--keep up the awesome work!

zrsbm	-31642	1347466486	running	A few questions involving fuel/hydration during long runs and a request for the FAQ	Hi r/running!  I am pretty much a complete noob at serious running.  I've been running casually on and off since high school (I am 24/F), and have several 5Ks under my belt, but I've only just begun *really* running.  I'm in love with it; I just ran my first 10K last weekend and I've got my eyes (feet?) set on a half-marathon trail race on December 1st.I always run on an empty stomach.  If I eat or drink anything within two or three hours of running, I get awful side stitches.  I've never hydrated during a run--during my 10K I didn't stop at any of the water stations.I'm a little concerned about hydration/fuel during long runs as I train for my first half (and first full next year).  I can easily get up a few hours early on the weekends and eat before my run, so pre-run food is not so much the issue as is what I eat/drink while I'm running.  I hear a lot on this sub that most people don't worry too much about fuel on short runs &lt; 6 miles/10 km, and I am now starting to reach distances beyond that point.At what point do I start fueling/hydrating during my long runs?  How do I determine what I use to fuel?  When I fuel? I'm really afraid of getting side pains midway through a run just because I try to eat or drink something.  I don't have any distance running gear yet (camelbak/belt/water bottle/gels etc.), and I'd also like some advice before I shell out the cash on these things.Also, there is currently no mention of fuel/hydration/gels/bloks/whatever in the FAQ.  I saw it mentioned a couple of times in the [FAQ discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/eqm8l/rrunning_announcement_running_faq/), but I am nowhere near qualified enough to add info to the FAQ.  I know information about this topic would have been extremely useful for me when I first started lurking in this sub--I had never heard of a "gel" or "clif blok" in my life.  Just a suggestion, but I think it'd be a great section to add.  Obviously even now I'm kind of clueless about how to start using these tools.**TL;DR: I'm a n00b and I don't know how to fuel/hydrate on long runs without cramps/side stiches.  Lacking info.  Help?**Thanks everyone!  You guys are all amazing and this sub has been so, so helpful as I start to get serious about this awesome sport.

120ap4	-31642	1351090786	personalfinance	In need of some advice: do I split up the "groups" of student loans with different interest rates?	Really sorry for the incredibly long Wall Of Text I'm about to create.  I really appreciate anyone who gets through this whole thing.I have 10 different federal direct student loans (some are un-subsidized, some are subsidized).  My loans are serviced through Direct Loan Servicing Center (ACS, myedaccount.com).  They have grouped my loans into two groups with a different interest rate for each group.  Group C is not really a problem, as the four loans within it all have the same interest rate (6.8%).  However, Group A includes six different loans with varying interest rates and an overall annual interest rate of 5.583%.  Here is a rough breakdown of Group A**Group A: Annual Interest Rate 5.583%*** Loan 1--Current Principal (CP): ~$1000, Annual Interest Rate (IR): 6.8%* Loan 2--CP: ~$1500, IR: 6.8%* Loan 3--CP: ~$1500, IR: 6.8%* Loan 4--CP: ~$2000, IR: 6.0%* Loan 5--CP: ~$5500, IR: 5.6%* Loan 6--CP: ~$5500, IR: 4.5%Interest accrues daily for my loans, so I compared how much interest would accrue in 30 days on each loan separately vs. how much interest would accrue in 30 days on the total principal balance for the group with the group interest rate.  From my calculations (feel free to double check), it looks like paying the loans individually would save me about $3.50 a month.At first that doesn't seem like a big deal, but I thought about it and it might really help to split them up for other reasons.  The way that ACS allocates extra money/payments is first to any outstanding fees, then interest, and then principal.  Right now, I'm paying a pretty low monthly payment (I just graduated and have a lot of other debt) and have a long-term loan; any extra money I put toward these loans only goes toward interest essentially, because of the way they're grouped together.  For example, if I have 10 loans and each loan has $10 worth of accrued interest, that is a total of $100 in interest I have to pay before ACS would allocate any money toward the principal.  Right now, there is no way I can afford $100+ extra per month.  If each loan is separate, I could put $20 extra toward one loan, which would cover the accrued interest for that loan and then knock $10 off the principal balance of that loan.  Is this a good way of looking at it?  Wouldn't I then be able to pay off the high interest rate loans with lower principal balances faster using this method?Another point to consider:  I currently don't use the electronic debiting system to make my payments, which I believe would give me a 0.25% discount on my interest rate.  Does anyone know if this discount would apply to each loan if I split them up from their groups?  If not, I'd have to run the numbers and see if the discount would help more than being able to allocate my payments toward individual loans.**TL;DR: Some of my student loans with varying interest rates are grouped together under one interest rate.  Should I bother splitting them up?**Thanks again for any help!

This is AWESOME topped with peanut butter if you have a few more calories to spend.**Microwave "Baked" Apples***Ingredients** 1 apple* 1 tsp cinnamon* 1-3 tsp sweetener of choice (I use sugar-free maple syrup)*Directions*Peel and core an apple.  I prefer slightly crisp apples, like Honeycrisp or Pink Lady, but any apple will do.  Cut the apple into small cubes.  Place the cubes in a microwave-safe bowl and coat with cinnamon and sweetener.  Microwave on high for 1-2 minutes until slightly soft.  Enjoy!  80-100 calories, depending on size of apple and type of sweetener used.**Black Bean Brownies***Ingredients** 1 18.25 oz box brownie mix—any brand/flavor will do* 1 15.5 oz can black beans* water*Directions*Drain the can of black beans and rinse both the black beans and the can until they are completely free of the salty liquid.  Place the black beans back into the can and fill the can up with water.  Using a blender, blend the water and the black beans until smooth.   Mix the black bean mixture with the brownie mix.  Bake according to the directions on the brownie mix box.   This obviously is not a single-serving recipe, so make sure you’ve got great portion control or a bunch of hungry friends/family/coworkers to help you eat them!   ~150-200 calories depending on the size of your brownieHope these are as enjoyable for you as they are for me.  Having dessert every night is really helpful for me because it makes me feel like I’m not depriving myself.
13zq90	-31642	1354196172	GetEmployed	I'm a mining engineer that may get laid off very soon--what alternative jobs should I be looking for?	I have a B.S. in mining engineering.  I work for a large U.S. coal company.  The coal industry is pretty much tanking right now; my company has been laying off coal miners since mid-summer and they've just now started in on the office/salaried folks.I started working with this company right after graduation in summer 2011.  All of my work experience--including summer internships--is in the mining industry.  Coal mining is pretty much the only industry in my immediate area, so if I get laid off there is not really a chance of getting hired by another coal company.I live close enough to commute to larger cities in the east Tennessee area (it would be about an hour commute one-way), but would need a decent salary to afford that long of a commute.  My question is:  what the heck kind of jobs do I apply for?  My skill set is very specific to the coal mining industry and I really don't know how it will transfer to other engineering fields.  I have experience in technical writing, dealing with regulatory agencies, environmental inspections, and drafting/AutoCAD but I wouldn't say I'm expert-level at anything since I've been working for less than two years.  I'm basically just looking for job titles and industries to look into.Also, I own a house that would be extremely difficult to sell (since there are no coal jobs available), so moving is not an option.EDIT:  I maybe should also mention that I have some experience with manual labor, as most of my internships in school were mining production type things.  I am certainly open to this type of work, but I am a pretty small female and in past job interviews I've had people doubt my ability to handle physical labor.  It may be hard for me to actually get a job in that line of work.Thanks for any advice you might be able to give me to prepare for a lay off.

14774n	-31642	1354542803	bicycling	Complete noob--I inherited bikes and have lots of questions; help very much appreciated	Hello r/bicycling.  Firstly, I’m a complete noob at anything and everything bikes, so please forgive my lack of technical jargon and general ignorance.  I've got a few (read: a lot) of questions for you guys.I’m a runner that’s been sidelined due to a few overuse injuries (shin splints, ITBS), but the lack of exercise is killing me.  Luckily, my dad happened to have two used mountain bikes (I think they are mountain bikes?) that he was trying to get rid of, so I gladly took them off his hands.  Like I said, I've been dying to do some sort of physical activity, so I dragged my boyfriend on a 12 mile bike ride yesterday to test them out.  I know this was probably too aggressive of a trial run, but I was excited to be able to exercise without crippling injury pain.  On with the questions:1.  I have no idea how old the bikes are, but they are a Trek Single Track 930 and a Trek Mountain Track 800.  I was using the Single Track 930, boyfriend was on the Mountain Track 800.  I literally have no idea what those titles even mean, so any information about those specific bikes would be extremely helpful.2.  I know that, like running shoes, the best way to get a properly fitted bike would be to head to a local bike shop.  *I really cannot afford a new bike at all*, so I’m pretty much going to have to stick with the one I was given or not bike.  Should I take the bike I already have into a bike shop to get help?  Is it rude to do that? I don’t know the etiquette for that sort of thing.  If someone helps me at a shop and I don’t purchase anything from them, do I tip them or something?  I’m awkward.   If that’s not really an option, how do I go about adjusting the bike to fit me as best as I can?3.  I don’t really know how important the difference between male bikes and the female bikes is.  Neither of the bikes have a step-through frame, so I’m assuming they are both male?  I’m a smallish female (5’4”, 127 lbs), and I don’t really know how much of an issue this will be.4. The biggest issues I ran into on my ride yesterday were pain in the shoulders and pain in my rear end.  I read [this]( http://www.sheldonbrown.com/saddles.html) article, which leads me to believe I may just not be used to bicycling, so my ass hurts a lot.  How do I tell if this is the issue, or if I need a new saddle?  If it is really important to have a new/different saddle, what price range am I looking at?  Again, I have a very small budget.  As far as the shoulder pain, I was definitely holding myself up a bit with my hands on the bike, which I assume is why I have pain in the shoulders.  I’m assuming this is a fit issue—should I try and raise the handlebars?  If they don’t go up any higher, is there anything I can do?5.  How do I position my feet on the pedals?  Should I be putting the toe/ball, middle, or back of my foot on the pedal?  Are my old running shoes okay to ride in?6. Do I use a thumb-under or thumb-over grip on the handlebars? 7. What are the absolute essentials I need with regard to gear?  I am planning on just using my running clothes for biking, but do I really need a pair of gloves?  Or biking shorts?  Or shoes?8. Absolute essentials for bike maintenance?  What do I need?I would really appreciate any information that you all can provide.  I swear I have read the FAQ, but in general I’m just a bit overwhelmed.  There is so much more involved with bicycling than running!   Plus, there are a lot of terms I see on forums that I’m not familiar with, so I’d appreciate it if you could use Explain-Like-I’m-Five type explanations.  EDIT:  Thanks a bunch for the information, you all have helped immensely.  I'll post a picture of the bikes when I get home from work, if that will help!**EDIT 2: [Here](http://imgur.com/a/uMk2v) are some pictures.  I only have a phone to use as a camera, so I couldn't take one with me in it.  I tried to use my truck for scale.**

1ln9kx	-31642	1378220198	MakeupAddiction	HELP! My friend has asked me to do her wedding day makeup. I need some foundation/primer advice!	Hello ladies and gents!  I am a total makeup addict and regularly do my girlfriends' makeup before going out drinking/clubbing/partying etc.  I'm not a professional makeup artist by any means; I really just do makeup for my friends because I love it.My best friend is getting married this November and she asked me to do her makeup this weekend for her bridal shower as a "trial run" for the wedding makeup.  I am SO honored she'd ask me to do her makeup for the big day, but I ran into some issues when practicing on her this weekend.I have extremely oily skin myself, and she told me she has a big problem with her makeup melting off her face so I assumed she was also pretty oily.  No problem, I thought!  My Revlon Colorstay and/or MAC Studio Fix always stay put on and give a flawless finish to my skin.The problem I ran into when I was doing her makeup is that her skin is a lot more textured than mine.  All of the foundations I tried just ended up looking SO cakey on her even after I buffed them out like crazy.  She is definitely oily and has some acne like myself, but because her skin is a totally different texture I'm at a loss of what products to use to make her skin look smooth and flawless without looking cakey.  And obviously this is for a wedding, so the foundation needs to stay put all day long.I personally don't ever use primers because they are just an added emollient to my already oily skin and my long-wearing foundations stay on perfectly without them.  I'm guessing a primer would be a good place to start for my friend...what do you guys think?  Any of you pro MUAs know what to do with oily &amp; textured skin for brides?  What primers would you recommend for simultaneously smoothing texture AND mattifying the face for a wedding?  I want my friend to look amazing and I need some pointers.

1t1naf	-31642	1387236752	jobs	Is it appropriate to inquire about the location of a job prior to submitting a resume/application?	I am looking to relocate and have a specific location in mind (SO is moving, I intend to follow if at all possible).  I was researching some jobs in my field in said location, and I found a position I'm very qualified for.  However, it has a Primary Location &amp; Secondary Location listed on the posting.  I'm not quite sure if this means if the job requires primary residence at one location and travel to another, or if they are looking for applicants in both locations with one preferred over the other. As I said before, I am looking for jobs in a specific location and I'm not really interested in applying if the job is not located in that place.  Is it appropriate to call/email about the location of the position before applying?  Who should I contact?
1tt94v	-31642	1388160477	engineering	Changing disciplines--looking for interview advice from Industrial/Mechanical engineers	Been working as a mining engineer/project engineer in a dying industry for the last 2.5 years since I graduated college.  I intend to relocate soon (SO is moving for work, have a specific location in mind), but since I have a pretty specialized degree I'm looking at project engineering positions in other industries.  I've already gotten a couple of recruiters contact me about industrial engineering positions for manufacturing companies.  I definitely think I have a strong project engineering resume, and I know those skills will be transferable, but I also am worried about the learning curve--manufacturing is a completely new industry for me.  Any industrial/mechanical engineers working for manufacturing companies have any interview advice?  I don't know if I should be prepared for technical questions.  I've never switched jobs professionally before, so I'm definitely out of my comfort zone.  Thanks!
1uso7j	-31642	1389276493	jobs	Got an interview! Questions about interview travel &amp; salary negotiation	I am trying to relocate to a new area asap (SO is moving, I have to have a job offer first).  I just started applying to positions a few weeks ago and I landed an interview with a pretty large manufacturing company pretty quickly.  They want me to come interview next week!  I'm excited, but nervous about some things:1. The area is about 5 hours from where I live now.  Should I ask if they will reimburse me for interview travel expenses?  How do I ask?  I obviously have my current address on my resume and on the job application, but I am worried if I point out the fact I'm not local again it will cost me the job.  I will be moving regardless, but if I'm going to be going to several interviews (I hope!) it would help me a lot to not have to pay for all of them.2. Salary negotiation!  I know there are hundreds of questions on this sub about this topic, but my specific question is this:  do I explain my circumstances and reasons I need a higher salary if they low-ball me?  I have a house in my current location and I am pretty positive it is not going to sell for a very long time (though I am considering renters, that might take a while too).  Basically I need to be making a comparable amount to what I make now to afford to move and keep making mortgage payments.  Do I tell them this in the interview, or keep the salary negotiations strictly about my qualifications and work experiences?  I've checked glassdoor, but it has been really hard to find an average salary for this type of position.3. Start date if I receive an offer (and any future offers).  If I get an offer I plan to accept, I will have to find a place to live in the new city, probably sell my current vehicle and get a new one, give my two weeks at my current job, and actually move along with 3 pets.  When they ask "When can you start?", how much time is a reasonable amount to ask for?  Again, do I explain my circumstances in this case?Thanks!
1ycgr0	-31642	1392821919	FancyFollicles	[RANT] How is it okay for companies to require CUTTING MY HAIR OFF for employment? :(	I had to have a drug test yesterday for a new job, and I found out on the spot that it was a hair test.  I was SO upset.  I know most people would just roll their eyes at me and say something like, "it's just hair, it grows back", but I thought maybe /r/fancyfollicles would understand.  It's not *just* hair, it's literally a part of my body and a part of my identity.  I spend so much time, money, and effort to grow my long curly hair and keep it healthy and they just cut a big 'ol chunk out of the back of it like it was nothing.  I could have cried.

Sometimes more, sometimes less.  I want more than anything to lift heavy and do barbell training, but there is no realistic way for me to be on a regular schedule and I am getting really discouraged.  I feel like I'm never going to have the body I want while I do this kind of job, and it gets me down a lot.Right now I mostly just run (and I do love running...but I fucking hate treadmills), and sometimes do random dumbbell circuits while I'm on the road.  I stay in extremely remote areas a lot, so having a gym membership is too expensive and not practical for me because a lot of places I travel don't even have a single gym, let alone a large chain gym.  I am relegated to really bad hotel "gyms". My office building at home has a decent gym I believe (I think there is a squat rack?), but I am only home during the weekdays about 30-40% of the time.I've also tried insanity/p90x videos so I could do them while I travel, but to be honest those videos are just too high-intensity and exhausting for me when I am already working a physically demanding job during the day, and a lot of it is too high-impact for my knees/shins as well.Does anyone have any tips for really working out on the road?  Does anyone else have these issues?  I am just so discouraged and I feel so gross and unhealthy all the time.  Halp.

2ndlii	-31642	1416928707	SkincareAddiction	I'm not wearing foundation to work for the first time in my entire adult life! Holy crap, SCA!	[Obligatory picture!](http://i.imgur.com/AYAWxnD.jpg) I'm wearing concealer under my eyes and around my nose, transparent face powder, mascara, and brow powder.  That's it!I'm 26 years old and have always struggled with mild to moderate acne. While it wasn't severe acne and could mostly be covered with makeup, it was extremely stressful for me. I hated my skin. I got into the habit of wearing a full face of foundation in about 7th grade (I stole my mom's makeup).After discovering this sub and changing my routine up, I've slowly started to ease up on the makeup and make short trips to the store without any. A year ago, I wouldn't have even walked to my mailbox without foundation on! Today is the first day I've ever gone without a full face to work EVER. I feel kind of sloppy, but I was running late and I figured...why not?**My Routine**AM: Stridex pads, Neutrogena Healthy Defense Liquid Moisturizer SPF 50 (if I'm going outside I use Neutrogena Sport Face SPF 70 instead), sometimes wash with CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser if I'm in the showerPM: Ponds Cold Cream, Up&amp;Up makeup wipes (from Target, the blue and white package), Stridex pads (occasionally switch to Alpha Hydrox Intensive Serum 14% Glycolic AHA if I have PIH), Cetaphil Moisturizing CreamMy previous pitfalls are the common ones I see here: over-cleansing for that tight skin feeling, using tons of drying toners, using way too many acne-fighting products at once, never moisturizing because I have oily skin, etc.Basically, my biggest surprise here is that less is truly more. The fact I don't even use a cleanser in the morning would have made 20-year-old me scoff.I will note that my acne may have also gotten better because I have drastically changed my diet since college, and I drink way more water than I used to. Getting older may have also been a factor. But the most drastic change for me came from switching my routine.I will probably still wear makeup on the regular, but now it's because I WANT to, not because it will cause me anxiety if I don't.

We've tried mixing cayenne with lard and brushing it on after frying, like I've heard Hattie B's does, but still it isn't quite there. Sprinkling dry cayenne on doesn't work either.Anyone have any tried and true recipes to get that distinct hot chicken flavor?Also...favorite beer to drink with hot chicken?
3g0dkx	-31642	1438872801	xxfitness	Question regarding personal trainers at the YMCA	Hey ladies!This is more of a general fitness question than a lady-specific one, but I love this sub and feel more comfortable posting here.So I signed up for a personal training deal at my YMCA a few months ago: 3 sessions for $99. I was terrified of the free weights section so it was mostly to help me get used to going over there.It helped immensely! My trainer is AWESOME and so excited that I wanted to lift heavy. He only has one other lady who is interested in lifting so I think he really enjoys working with me. He also sent me a customized workout that I can do in hotel gyms (I travel for work) which I use all the time.My question is about how he gets paid. Recently, he's seen me in the gym a few times when he's working regular gym hours and he'll come over to help me. He'll sometimes stay with me through my whole workout (currently doing SS) to help me with form and spotting. I REALLY appreciate him doing this, but I haven't paid for more sessions and the last thing I want to do is take advantage of his help without paying him. Do any of you ladies know if personal trainers at the Y are paid on a per-client basis, per session basis, or if they are salaried? Personal training is too expensive for me to do regularly but I bought those sessions to help get me started. My trainer is so helpful and insists he's cool with staying to help off the clock but I really don't want to cheat him out of money. I would feel so bad if he's helping me without compensation. I would honestly march right in there and pay for like 10 sessions today if he gets paid based on how many clients/sessions he does. If he is salaried though, it might be less bad because he gets paid the same either way?Help!Thoughts?

3ho8d2	-31642	1440040288	Nexus5	[Solution] for random shut downs, "optimizing apps" on restart (NOT boot loop power button issue)	The solution is pretty simple: a new battery. I ordered mine for $8 on Amazon and my phone has held a charge since I installed the replacement and restarted.Just thought I'd share in case anyone is having a similar issue. I've watched videos of the boot loop issue with the power button and I don't think this is the same thing. My phone started shutting off about a month ago during CPU intensive tasks like using GPS and video recording. It slowly progressed to turning off within a minute of being unplugged. Once off charge, I could power on but it would never make it through the boot animation. I had to plug it back in to turn it on, and once I did it would have to "optimize apps" for 10 minutes like I had just updated the OS. Really, really, really irritating.I've seen a few people on some Android forums and on Reddit with the same issue and there seems to be a lot of confusion over the solution because it sounds so similar to the power button boot loop. I tried downgrading to KitKat to see if it was Lollipop causing the issue, which a few people suggested (nope). I also called Google because a few people managed to get replacement phones from them; no luck there, they told me to call LG if a factory reset didn't work (it didn't). I never did call LG because my phone is out of warranty and I knew what they would say.**TL;DR: get a new battery**

h1np9	-31643	1304291185	AskReddit	Is it ever acceptable to check your SO's email?	My roommate's fiance does this constantly, and each time it causes a giant fight because she always feels her reason is justified. Today they fought because he had been on a trip and didn't tell her the itinerary and she logged on to get it and he, understandably, was pissed.My SO and I know each others passwords and such but never have we felt the need to "check up" on each other or whatever. Some female friends of mine think checking their partner's email/facebook/whatever is fine if you have a reason. This makes no sense to me. Can anyone explain?TL;DR Is there really any true "justified" reason to access a SO's personal email account?

She is the sweetest person and knows that it is an uncomfortable situation and makes it quick and easy so as to be the least unpleasant as possible. She cares about my life beyond my vagina. We are even friends on facebook! For this reason I am always the advocate to encourage my other friends to go see their own gyno, or to find one that they love. After all, if something is wrong with your lady bits its in your best interest to feel comfortable with your physician! Does anyone else have extreme love for their gyno, or am I just entirely strange?

q21gr	-31643	1329971256	TwoXChromosomes	Is anyone else a paranoid crazyperson like me?	So this is not the first time this has happened, but any time my body does something slightly abnormal and I look up causes I immediately talk myself into thinking I am pregnant. I have been on the pill for a very long time, and have been with my partner for eight years and we've never had a scare but I am always convinced that regardless of my symptoms that I must be pregnant. This time it is because my nipples have been sore for two days. I am sure there are reasonable explanations for this, but when I google sore nipples I keep getting that it is a sign of pregnancy. I literally had my period last week and have not had sex since.Does anyone else get preggy paranoia or is it just me?

1wbjr9	-31643	1390863526	Anthropology	Anthropologist perspective on "whale killings"	Hey lovely Anthropology enthusiasts,As an anthro major in college I (like many of you!) studied a lot of cultures WAY different from our own, whose practices may or may not have lined up with the Western views under which I currently live (Southern US). This link [here] (http://www.snopes.com/photos/hunting/dolphinhunt.asphttp://www.snopes.com/photos/hunting/dolphinhunt.asp) has been circling around various social media outlets, and I did some research into it today out of curiosity. (For the lazy, it is a mass "slaughter" of pilot whales in the Faroe Islands, accompanied by gory pictures and incorrect text painting a terrible, animal abuse scene). After researching and finding out that it is classified as a "hunting for sustenance" and that the whales are not actually endangered, and that the amount killed does not significantly harm their population, ALONG with the fact that it is a centuries old tradition, I find little fault with it. Edit: Changed "Denmark" to Faroe IslandsApparently I am WRONG.I think that my somewhat accepting view on it may be due in part to my anthropological background, so my question for ya'll is this: What do you think? Mass, thoughtless, animal slaughter or an organized traditional sustenance kill?

Fucking sinkhole that opened on Magnolia today caught the edge of my tire when I couldn't swerve 100% out of the lane, denting my inner wheel area pretty bad. I have a 2009 Honda Fit sport and could not find it at any junkyard or you-pull places from a quick search of online inventory. I'm planning on making some phone calls, but am not sure if I can just get it repaired instead of having to replace it and my tire which is pretty shot. I'm a girl and don't know a whole lot about cars, making me an easy target for some repairmen/mechanics so if anyone has any advice or ideas please let me know. I can post a picture of the wheel if it would be helpful. I can't afford a lot of repairs and am just hoping its only the wheel and tire that are damaged.

2ixa9h	-31643	1413004960	TwoXChromosomes	Anyone here with long term birth control use?	I have been on the pill (Levora 28, specifically) for probably ten years now. After trial and error with a few pills at the start when I was 16 I haven't switched off this one. I mainly took it for what was thought to be PCOS but turned out not to be, and continued to take it for the convenience of knowing when I'd  get my periods, lighter periods, less cramps, clearer skin, etc. However over the past year or so I have noticed increasing PMS symptoms coming back. I got my period today and have broken out, am currently experiencing insomnia (only happens before or during my period and used to happen before I started taking the pill), have a sebaceous cyst (also likely period related according to my gyn), and have cramps (still not as bad as before but seems to be getting worse with each period.)Has anyone else who has been on the pill long term noticed this? My gyn suggested switching pills but I had a bad reaction to one when I was first figuring out what to take and it worries me about switching. Also I am married now and not looking to have kids yet so switching around would leave me a bit less protected than I prefer (not a fan of condoms, tend to have reactions). Just wondering if anyone else has noticed the "beneficial" side effects of their pill wearing off after long term use. Trying to find some research on it but having a hard time.Thanks ladies! I appreciate it!

I’m currently going into my 3rd year of college at Boston University and I’m a double major, in Cello Performance and Composition &amp; Theory.  I’ve always loved video games, even to the extent of being interested in design, but music was my passion and naturally I stuck with it.  I have often been told my music sounds like it’s from the score of a film or video game, and after thinking about it, that’s definitely a path I’m interested in going down.  So, if you are at all interested in hearing my stuff or possibly using it in a game/film, I would recommend you listen to a few of my pieces, which I have posted on my SoundCloud (www.soundcloud.com/cellofr3ak).  Please feel free to email me at cellofr3ak@gmail.com, on SoundCloud, or PM me in the forum if you have questions, comments, or would be interested in working together.Thanks.P.S. Some of the SoundCloud recordings are pretty soft, so I’d recommend using headphones/turning your volume up to hear them.  The main purpose for this is so they cannot be ripped off.

If we can put out the fire soon, there is still a house there, and we can always rebuild any portions that get burnt, though it will take time.  **The Optimists**: They look at the house and go "Nah, it's not that bad.  The fire department will show up and put it out!  And we could DEFINITELY still win the 'Best Home in the Neighborhood' award."  Problem is, you're not the fire department, and don't own a phone to call them.  We have no way of knowing whether or not they will come, because the person with the phone (York) hasn't really had to call them before.  The judging for the 'Best Home' award begins in 3 months.  How long does it take to rebuild a house?  The guy who is planning the rebuild has only built a few condos in Europe.  **The Grumps**: They see the few rooms caught on fire and turn around, saying "This house was better in the 80's anyways.  I hated the new paint and the floor plan was terrible. Let it burn."  If the house was so bad, why did it come in a very close second place for 'Best Home in the Neighborhood' only 3 seasons ago with the SAME new paint job (Kaep) and the SAME floor plan (Harbaugh's System)?  No one just *lucks* into the final round for that award.  It's extremely competitive and anyone who thinks a terrible house can make it to the finals will never be happy, and will always find something wrong with *any* house they come across.Can we stop arguing these same three tired points of view, and instead realize we are supposed to be fans of the same team?  Let's focus on who we can replace the losses with, and compare opinions on players without the blanket steamrolling.  Try to put yourself in the shoes of the person you disagree with.  Try to see their point of view, and respect that no matter what you say, they might still disagree with you after you've said your piece.  And if you're going to disagree with someone, **don't put them down**.  That helps no one.  If everyone thinks they are going to be attacked for having an opinion, no one is going to post.Save your hate for the cowbows, packers, and seahawks.Edit: Failed at numbers.

I've been looking for a job for four years now, and without any calls or interviews, I've almost given up on that as well. The only reason I get out of bed in the morning is from sheer boredom. So...

Over the course of three months, I got pretty close to the stage manager (we'll call her  Brie).I first started talking to her when I was talking to a friend and she heard me saying something about a character in the Forgotten Realms books. First impression, she was smart, funny, attractive, and out of my league. After the first show, I asked her for her phone number and we continued to talk. Today I told her I like her, and asked if she wanted to go do something sometime. She declined and said she doesn't like me like that and said she appreciated it though.I'm tired of hearing cliche BS from everyone.I'm tired of people telling me there are other fish in the sea. I'm tired of people telling me I'll find someone.I don't know why I do this anymore./rantEDIT: a phrase worded differently for clarity.

Earlier this year I received a bike from a family friend so I could get to a local gym when needed, and 3-5 times a week I'd cycle 3 miles to and from. Earlier this week I biked a 30-mile round trip to a nearby city and it felt pretty good.A few hours ago I went to see how far a trip to a friend in a different state is. So I'll get to my point:If I wanted to bike 120-130 miles, what would your advice to me be?I have an 18-speed mountain bike, and I would bring a change of clothes, and plenty of water as well as at least 2 meals and snacks for energy. According to google maps' biking directions, it would take me roughly 9 hours to complete (Based on it's directions and estimated time for the 30-mile trip I'd say it'll take more like 12 hours)Yesterday I decided to go through advice videos and how-tos to fix many of the minor issues with my bike, such as brakes being loose and gear shift cables being loose, but some issues are still present. The rims aren't perfectly aligned (true?) and the back axle seems to be a bit off (The gears in the back seem to wobble when the tire spins)[My bike](http://i.imgur.com/8ON6iDq.jpg)TL;DR Need any advice for a long bike trip.

Sorry if there's a better place for this, but I figured there are probably quite a few people who could just look down to answer.My grandfather was in the navy and recently passed away, and his dog tags are nowhere to be found. I was planning on ordering some online to give to my mother and having them stamped in proper navy style, but everywhere I search seems to have different ideas on how it is stamped. So my question is: **How are Navy dog tags formatted?****EDIT**: Thanks for the answers, guys! I'll have to do a bit of searching for some of the information, but I think I have all I need.
39mo6g	-31663	1434141689	metalworking	New to metalworking and I could use some help.	Hello all! I recently made the DIY foundry from Grant Thomson's video on youtube, and I was wondering if you all had any tips for things like lost-wax/foam casting and even some projects I could try that are relatively simple for someone just starting out.I have safety equipment (got burned by someone with a soldering iron in highschool, I have no desire to get burned with molten metal) insulated hide gloves, leather apron, safety glasses, face mask (no money for respirator) and the foundry itself is boxed in with cement patio tiles and sand in case of spills/foundry failing.My crucible for now is the bottom part of a fire extinguisher.Also  I could use help with molds, and casting in general.I have seen some videos on lost-wax and lost-foam casting, but have yet to get responses from people who do actual casting themselves. How would you go about making a wax mold of something and then casting it in metal?For instance, I have a small plastic item I would like to cast with metal but I want to keep the original. Someone suggested a two part mold with silicone rubber first then filling that with wax, then casting plaster around the wax and burning the wax out. Is that feasible, and would there be a simpler way? And finally, are there any videos you know of that could help me with what I want to do?Thank you for your time!And sorry if anything I've discussed has been gone over before...

3am2fd	-31663	1434901204	GiftofGames	[Request] Counter Strike: Source	Even at $8 it's still too expensive for my bank account right now...I could tell you a sob story about how I was "laid off" (they don't like to call it firing) from my previous job last year, and decided to join the military, got a medical discharge after a month, and am still struggling to find employment (hell even McDonald's isn't hiring right now. All those highschool students getting summer jobs and whatnot) and all this on top of medical expenses as I don't have insurance, but I'm sure most aren't interested in that.I've heard that CS is actually pretty good, and I've seen plenty of videos and it looks pretty awesome!Usually  I prefer games like The Witcher, Skyrim, Farcry 4, and things like that, but I have gone into things like CoD and Gears of War. I do like the multiplayer scene, and the Counter Strike series seems to be pretty cool. I hear it's much harder and a bit more in depth than basic shoters like CoD, and that's part of what intrigues me so much. I used to be pretty into CoD when all my friends played it, but now they've all moved on to different games. As I only have a 5 year old laptop to game on, I can't play the big titles like Battlefield, GTA or Call of Duty, but it handles valve games pretty well. If I could get the complete CS bundle I would, but alas my bank account has less than $10 in it, and I have to keep a minimum of $5 to keep it open. I've been lucky enough to have someone gift me Garry's Mod, and I found out I can use other valve games inside Gmod like LFD and CS:S, that would  give me even more fun to have than just one thing.Edit: Everything after the first line. Mods (rightfully) removed it, since literally all it was was a half-assed mobile post. Hopefully this makes up for it!Would love to humiliate  myself trying to play with some of you!http://steamcommunity.com/id/SARGEx117

TL;DR - TitleI'm 5'10", 200 pounds, and I've been looking to upgrade my bike (I just have a Next PowerX from walmart, a gift when I was losing weight) and I want to get a road bike. I have a few friends who have Specialized bikes and suggested I look there, as they've all had good experiences with Specialized. I was looking at a [Specialized Crosstrail Disc](http://www.specialized.com/us/en/bikes/multi-use/crosstrail/crosstrail-disc), it fits what I want, and doesn't have things I don't need.Since my budget has almost literally no room for things like this, I won't be getting this bike until next year at the earliest.What would you suggest instead of this bike?It needs to have a straight bar for handles (I don't like curved like most race/road bikes have), I don't have the budget to build one, and it needs to be comfortable enough to get me 100 miles in a day (not much for some of you, but I have yet to do a century (that'll change friday though!) and it just needs to do it's job better than a cheap walmart bike).And apologies if this post violates the rules in any way.

Total distance from home, 124 miles. I ended up getting to my destination around 9pm. Google said 10 hours, but after awhile, I was lucky to hit 10mph. On my normal commute (4mi) I can hit 25 easily. The fastest I've ever gone was 40mph, and it was in a 30mph zone. I had to shut down Strava after 70 miles due to battery concerns, but at least it recorded my first metric century!My bike (which was a gift to get me to the gym last year) is a [Next PowerX](http://i.imgur.com/8ON6iDq.jpg) from Walmart (yes, I know I need a better bike. I also need a job to pay for it). It weighs 45 pounds, has full suspension, and tires made for gripping dirt. Your standard cheap MTB from Walmart.I was planning on staying with friends for a few days down in kentucky, and packed clothes, food, water/gatorade, any tools I'd need to fix a problem, two innertubes, patch kit, and a few odds and ends. Total pack weight, 25 Pounds. So all together, with my 200 pounds, there was a lot of weight to move.Last month I wrecked my bike. Flipped over the handlebars, bike flipped over me, my whole left side was wrecked, and I'm pretty sure I have a bruised rib. (going to the doctor when my insurance clears) Amazingly I didn't hit my head, but I could have easily been worse off. I haven't forgotten my helmet since.I'm fairly new to biking (at least enjoying it anyway) and I can't wait to get a real road bike and go farther distances. Have an adventure.I hope to be able to bike across my state (Ohio-Erie 300-something miles) in the next two years, and I hope to get some people together to bike across the US within ten years. Altogether, I'd say this trip, painful as it was, has done nothing to quell my desires, it's just added fuel to the flame.I've never felt more accomplished than I did friday. I went from a lazy 275lb couch potato to 200 and biking for fun at least 3 times a week in less than a year. I'm even organizing rides to nearby cities for youth at a local church.

So my Problem is that one of the players suddenly decided he'd like to play a new character, because he fellt his current PC was overpowered and boring.He is playing a Half-Orc Barbarian with this stats:Str: 20, Dex: 18, Con: 18, Int: 9, Wis: 16 and Cha: 14Now, he already said he'd like to play a Monk next and I already told/offered him a Class change, but he declined because of his stats.What I'm really worried however is that he wants his PC to die in means of turning against the rest of the group and kill the weak Wizzard.I already talked to him about it, tried to bring up alternatives how his PC would depart from the group, but he seemed pretty adamant about his idea.Now I turn to those of you who had similar problems with their players, how did you handle it? Did you let them pull their idea through or could you talk them out of it?Note: We are all beginners, so I don't have any experience with this. And yes, the main reason could probably be that I didn't make the game challenging enought because of that.

2arc77	-31668	1405429614	asoiafpowers	[Event] The breaking of Sacred laws.	Domeric Jordayne sat in the chair his late father always sat in, as did his grandfather before. To his left, his brother Othel sat, writing down what the man in front of them said, so it could be archived in the library of the Jordayne's. On the other side of his chair, Elyn was standing, looking at the man, angry.“Repeat that once again, will you?” she asked him “What do you say my brother did?”The man, a newly appointed vassal of the Tor, spoke up, once again “He violated the guest right! When he visited my brother's keep a week ago, we offered him bread and salt, he ate and drank at our table and slept under our roof! But then, as the evening became night and most of us were preparing to go to bed, I saw him, how he slew my lord and brother, Ser Reese!” He pointed accusing at the Lord of the Tor “**You drove that sword of yours through his heart and then threw him down in one of the wells, to hide his body and poison our water!**”“You accuse your Lord of violating the guest right?” Elyn repeated, taking slow steps towards the man “Do you think this is a cruel jest or something? Why should my brother do something stupid as that? The gods would curse our whole House!”“He killed my brother, I saw it with my own eyes!” the man told her angry, while she slowly took one step after the other towards him “He violated guest right and killed my brother! He is a criminal!”“You know what the punishment for lying is, don't you?” Elyn asked the man grim.The man grew nervous “Y- Yes, my lady, I know.” he licked over his lips “Removal of the tongue.”Elyn nodded, while she slowly walked around him “Did you know, that some of the Lord of Light's  worshiper are able to cover their blades in flames?”Elyn knew that this was not completely true, as did her brother Domeric.“Do you want to see if I am one of these, too?”Fearsome, the man fell to his knees in front of the woman, who simply glared at him with her green eyes “Please, don't take my tongue!”“Elyn, it is enough.” Domeric said, speaking up for the first time since the man arrived to accuse him of this crime “Your brother, Ser Reese, is dead and I am sorry for this. However, when my men and I left your keep, we thought he was still sleeping, and not down in the well. I apologize for this as well. But you accuse me of breaking a sacred law, hated by all gods and man. How is it possible that a honorable lord like you, suddenly tells lies about me breaking the Guest Right?”The man was already intimidated enough by Elyn that he broke out in tears “It is true, you did not kill my brother. The night you visited us, he drank too much and fell in the well. It was his own fault and I saw it.”“Wait,” Lord Domeric interrupted him “You saw how your brother fell in the well? Why did you not help your brother?”“He- I could not help him out and he did not respond to my calls, so I assumed I was already too late.” the man said, stuttering.Domeric knew that the man was lying, but he knew there were no laws that would have forced him to help his brother “And why did you accuse me of killing him, while under your roof?”“I- I did not know- I- I just did not want that- that Reese is remembered for- for drowning in a well while drunk.” the man tried to explain himself “My Lord, please, don't cut my tongue out! I will do anything so I can keep it!”“Anything?” Domeric repeated “Do you own furs for when it is cold?”The man shook his head “N- No my lord.”“The punishment for lying usually is removal of the Tongue.” Domeric said as he stood up from his chair “You openly and willingly confessed to have lied about my breaking of the Guest Right. Is this true?”“Y- Yes, my lord.” he told his Lord with a slow nod.“You wish not to lose your tongue, so I order you to let your armor be brought here, and buy furs for you. Dye them all black, as Dornishman on the Wall you will need them. A ship headed for Eastwatch by the Sea will leave within this month from Sunspear, if I am not mistaken.” Domeric stopped, thinking about what else the man did “For not helping your brother, I can not judge or punish you. May the gods decide for your fate on that matter.”

The end of the year came and went past, visits were made, things discussed. He was glad that it became quiet at the Tor for a while, the constant news that arrived of war and what not worried him enough.“Dom, your sister needs to tell you something.” Elyn said as she and their little sister entered the room. Dorna, a woman of 20 years, wore her hair long, as opposed by her sister, who had short hair. Her green eyes were reddened by tears.“What is it?” Domeric asked calm, putting the book aside.Tears were running down her face and the Lord of the Tor guessed that Elyn already yelled at her “I- I- I am- I am-“ the woman stuttered, before her sister interrupted her.“She is with child, Domeric!” Elyn said loud, so there was no chance he could have heard wrong.The men’s eyes widened “WHAT?” he stood up and walked towards his sisters “How… Who?”“I- I- It was an accident!” the young woman yelled at her brother “I- I never wanted this to happen.”“Who is the father of the child?” Domeric asked calm, but with authority in his voice.Dorna shook her head “He- I-““**Who. Is. The. Father?**” Domeric repeated, this time louder and angrier.“A- A- Aegon….” Dorna muttered, her head lowered in shame.“Targaryen?” He asked his little sister surprised “The Son of the King’s Hand?” After she nodded, Domeric let out a sigh and turned around. “When did it happen?”“Two- Two months ago, when he- he traveled through Dorne…”  the young woman began to weep “I- I never wanted this to happen.”Domeric clenched a fist after listening to his sister “That stupid-  Aegon is married as far as I know and I think he has a son as well…” he sat back down on his chair “If you wish, I will let Maester Ulwyck prepare Moon tea for you.”“No!” Dorna shouted horrified and wrapped her arms around her belly “No- Please not. I- I want to- to-““You want to birth the child?” Elyn asked her sister surprised “Then why did you come to me?”“I- I hoped you knew what I could do…” Dorna told her sister, sobbing.Domeric walked past his sisters, heading for Maester Ulwyck “I think I will need to send a letter or two…”[Meta] So, I am not really sure weather I get XP for this or not, or what this will mean on the long run...

Jaehaerys Sand.Domeric could see that, what little hair covered the babe’s head was in a silvery white color. Around his neck, there was a red mark. Strangled by his own umbilical cord, Ulwyck had told him.Hot tears blured his vision as he looked at the second body. There she laid, his sweet, innocent sister. Ripped out of life by a child. She was dressed in her favorite dress, in the color of the setting sun. Her hands were folded over her chest and a soft expression was on her face.  It was too hard to look at the bodies. His sister was dead! Maester Ulwyck had said that the loss of too much blood while giving birth was what killed his sister. Next to him, Othel, Elyn, Myra and his children Nymeria and Lyle all mourned for the loss of Dorna.Othel was speechless, filled with grief, he had laid a green rose he had purchased from an Esossi merchant, where his sister’s heart was.The ever cold Elyn only kneeled next to her sister and cried.“I was away half her live, and now she is gone!” Domeric recalled her saying, after Maester Ulwyck brought the news.Myra had wrapped her arms around their children, but Lyle still asked her sobbing “Why did Aunt Dorna have to go? I don’t want her to go!”Mantarys stood away from them, at the entrance of the Sept. Domeric knew how close the two were. He had told his brother to come with them and pray for their sister and nephew, but he stopped after the door and told him “I will pray for her when your family is finished, my lord.”“Not even in the death of our sister you want to join us as family?” Domeric asked him saddened “It’s blood that binds us, not Names.”“I know…” Mantarys told him, tears filling his eyes already “I… I am just no ready yet…”As his family was ready to leave, Domeric waited and laid a hand on the cold stone altar they were bedded on.“Dorna, I swear by the gods that I will not forget what the Targaryens did to you.” He whispered sad.*I will, no matter what, never bow to people like this. No matter what the prince wants or even commands, I and House Jordayne will not bow to the dragon!* He thought angry as he left the Sept as well.*I promise you, little sister.*

It was an honor for the small Lord to be raised into the small council of Prince Maron Martell.This however did not outweigh the other things that had happened:[Early on in 169 one of Lord Domeric's vassals accused him of breaking the Guest Right and murdering his host.

The chains that were put on his wrists and feet were removed before he entered. He had seen the Lord of the Tor only once until this day. It was when his sister and her babe were laid to rest in their crypts and then only from afar.“This is the thief?” the Lord asked, his emerald green eyes looking the man up and down.“Yes, my lord.” the City Guard said “He was caught stealing from his master at the forge. He wanted to steal a sword he had made.”“How is your name, thief?” the Lord asked calm.“Kromley, m'lord.” he replied nervous. He knew what he had done, and what the punishment for it was.“Now, Kromley, why did you steal a sword?” the Lord asked him.Truth be told, he wasn't really sure why he stole the sword. When he finished it, he felt like it was so perfectly made, it should simply belong to him, because he made it. “I... I don't know m'lord, I just... I just-”“You just thought it should be yours?” the Lord finished for him.“Yes m'lord...” Kromley admitted ashamed.“You know what the punishment for thievery is?” the woman next to the Lord asked. She had short dark hair and the same green eyes as Lord Jordayne.“Y- Yes, m'lady.” he stutterd “The loss of a hand.”“So be it.” Lord Jordayne told Kromley after a moment of what looked like confusion to Kromley “You can decide, lose your hand, serve at the Night's Watch, or go to Gaston Grey for 3 years.”*It was said that the Wall was a terrible place where you wish you rather took the punishment than the black.

Your hand, the Wall for live or 3 years in Gaston Grey.”Kromley thought for a moment “M'lord, I... I want to still be of use.”“Then you go to the Wall.” Lord Jordayne announced “Guards, take him to the dungeon until a man of the Night's Watch arrives again.”“But-” Kromley tried to say before he was dragged away.

2c5z6b	-31668	1406746298	asoiafpowers	[Event] Bandit Raid	“My Lord, I bring bad news...” the man that came riding only a few minutes earlier told him.“I'm listening.” Lord Domeric said calm, he knew that the man was one of the party that accompanied his sister and daughter on a ride. As far as he knew, Elyn wanted to teach Nymeria how to hunt and use a bow.“It... it's  your sister and daughter, my Lord.” the man told him hesitant “We... we were ambushed by some savage bandits! Lady Elyn told me to ride for home and report that we were attacked.”“They... they were taken by bandits?” Domeric asked surprised “How in the seven hells did this happen?”“I... I don't know my lord!” the man told him, stumbling a few steps back “We- We were ambushed!”“And you rode away, leaving my daughter and heir behind?” Domeric asked enraged “What madness caused you to leave them behind?”“Lady Elyn ordered me to ride, while she held the bandits back from herself and Lady Nymeria.” the messenger told him “The- The last time I saw the Lady was when I looked over my shoulder, riding for the Tor.”Domeric nodded slowly “I see...” he then waved his hand at a guard, who led the man out “Call for my brother Mantarys.”-----------------------------------------------------When Mantarys Sand entered the room, Lord Domeric sat in his high chair, a worried expression on his face. The armor Mantarys wore, a simple leather armor with chain-mail beneath, was adorned with his personal coat of arms, the quill of House Jordayne above an empty piece of parchment.“You called for me, my Lord?” Mantarys asked with a raised brow, seeing the worried expression on his brother's face.“Don't 'my Lord' me, Mantarys!” Domeric told him angry “There is a problem.”The smile on Mantarys' lips vanished in an instant “What happened? Another raid?”The Lord of the Tor shook his head “It's worse... a group of bandits, they...” he took a breath “they ambushed El and Nym and probably taken them hostage or worse.”Mantarys' hand clenched around the hilt of his sword “My Lord let me-”Lord Domeric interrupted him “Take 15 of your best men and take the fastest horses we have. Ride those sons of bitches down and kill every single one of them! If they did harm either our sister or my daughter, bring one back, so we can get out of him from where they came! This won't be tolerated!”With a nod, but also with hesitation Mantarys looked at his brother “My Lord, isn't this a little-”“Harsh? Yes, we need to make a point. Ambushing a member of House Jordayne should be a mistake no one should ever make.” he dismissed him “Now, go and get ready, I want you back by the first light of the second day!”----------------------------“Mantarys!” his brother's voice called after him when he was about to ride out for his sister and niece. As he turned to see what his brother wanted, he saw Domeric approach him, a sword in its scabbard in his hands. He immediately recognized the parchment colored leather of the scabbard and the sword's hilt.“Take this with you. Use it to kill those bandits. It has been too long that the Emerald Ink of House Jordayne drew blood.” He told him as he handed him the bastard sword.“My Lord, I am just a bastard. I am not worthy to wield a Valyrian Steel sword, especially not if it is rightfully yours to wield.”“You know I am no warrior!” Domeric said with a laugh “Take it and make me proud!”“I will, my Lord.” Mantarys said after he took the sword and attached the scabbard to his belt, he then turned his horse around and together with his men, rode out to find Elyn and Nymeria.----------------------------When they saw the cook fire of the bandits, they dismounted their horses and sneaked towards the glow in the evening. They rode for about ten miles before they reached the spot they were currently in.“Once we are close enough, we need to see if Lady Elyn and Lady Nymeria are still alive, before we attack. If so, let one man live, but kill the others.” he ordered, before drawing Emerald Ink, the dark Valyrian steel glimmering in the light of the setting sun “Let's go.”With a warcry, Mantarys jumped out of his cover near the bandits and swung his sword at the closest man. Blood spilled, an arm dropped to the ground and before the man was even able to cry out in pain, the green blade sliced through his thoat.Blood covered, Mantarys and his men charged into the camp, slaughtering the bandits.A tall bandit swung his greatsword towards him, almost taking his head from his shoulders. He got down on his knees to dodge the blade, but it cut over his back, ripping open the leather and chainmail, scratching of part of the skin on his back. With an outcry of pain, Mantarys managed to swing his sword upward again, lodging it between the mans feet, cutting him up to his navel. As he pulled Emerald Ink out of the man's body, his bowels fell to the ground.After only a few minutes, the skirmish ended with all but one of the bandits lying dead on the ground, but also seven of Mantarys' men.“Thanks, but really, we got it under control...” A familiar voice told him.As he turned around, he saw his sister and niece, standing behind him, both heavily bruised and with swords.“Are you alright?” Mantarys asked them worried “Did they do anything to you?”Elyn shrugged with a smirk “Nothing we couldn't handle, right Nym?” “Yeah.” Nymeria said with a weak smile “Can we go home now?”“Yes.” Mantarys said and then turned to one of his surviving men “Take the survivor and then let's ride for home.”**[Meta] I'm not sure what kind of XP that would be...**

He knew the lord good, as they grew up together untill he was send away to be fostered at Sandstone with the late Lord Quorgyle."Jon!" He exclaimed with a smile "Was brings you into my home?" His smile quickly faded as he notices that the two guards that escorted the young lord were not his own, but of House Jordayne, wearing the green on moss checked cloak of the guard."Oh Jon..." Domeric said with a sigh "what have you done?""M'lord, this man was caught raping a newly wed woman before her husband could bed her." One of the guards told his Lord."Raped?" Jon asked surpised "I raped no one! I took the right of the First Night, nothing else!""The First Night?" Domeric asked confused before he remembered "Ah, isn't this some old tradition of the Andals?""Yeah, the lord is allowed to bed the bride before the groom, so what?" Jon told him with a shrug."So what?" Domeric asked him enragred "The right of the First Night was outlawed long ago! And we are Dornishman! No Andals or First Men! We respect woman and don't abuse them like a toy like you did!""I took what was my right!" Jon insisted stuborn."By what right? Neither by the right of law nor the right of dornish tradition, so I ask you jon, what right do you have to rape a woman on her wedding night, before even her groom can bed her?""And I thought you of all would understand..." the low lord spat out in disgust "But i was wrong... you are weak.""Weak is it?" The Lord of the Tor said calm "tell me Jon, do you have children, an heir?""I do my lord. A daughter of ten-and-three." Jon told him confused "But I don't see-""Silence!" Domeric interrupted him "Does she know what you did? That you took the 'right' of the First Night?""No, my lord..." Jon said ashamed, lowering his head "She does not.""Then I order you to explain to her what you did and see her reaction." Domeric told him and leaned back in his chair."I will, my lord..." The lesser lord said with a nod and turned arround."THIS IS NOT OVER YET!" The voice echoed through the hall and Jon stopped in his tracks.As he turned arround he could see that Lord Jordayne rose from his chair and now walked towards him."You don't think you get off so easy, do you?" Lord Domeric asked "You are a rapist, still and you will be treated as one. Before you return to your own hall you will be castrated for what you did and after you told your daughter what you did, you will be brought back here, so a ship can take you to Ghaston Grey for your remaining livetime. Farewell Jon..." "What?" The dornishman exclaimed shocked as the two guards that brought him draged him away "No! It was my right!" he yelled as they opened the door out "MY RIGHT!"Domeric sighed as he sank back into his chair, *damned fool...* he thought *you will see what it brought you, that short few minutes of pleasure...*

And once Maron was old enough, after having learned everything possible of his Unlces and Ulwyck, he would be going to the Citadel of Oldtown and become a Master in the arts of Economy, taught by the best Maesters there are.Mantarys jumped down the rock and landed near Maron. The boy immediatly turned his head to his father and smiled.*It is good to be a father* Mantarys thought, as they both walked towards their rooms.

Also they took cattle from there and brought it back to their homes.""So you took land, harvest and cattle from our Lord Hand's land?" Domeric asked the three surprised "Did you at least sow the crops yourself, or did you steal them as well?""Aye, m'Lord, we did. But I swear to the gods I did not know we were on Lord Yronwood's land!" One of the farmers told him.Domeric listened, then asked "And what about the cattle? You took those as well, didn't you? What did you do with it?" "We- I thought it ran away from its owner so I brought it back to the rest of mine, so in case the owner comes searching, I could give it to him!""Did you sow the crops yourself or did you only harvest them? Lord Yronwood's lands are barren enough, it would be stupud to steal from him what harvest he has.""We have sown it ourself, m'lord. We mark our fields so we don't take other men's yield." The oldest of the three explained."And how do we proceed?" Domeric asked, he wasn't quite sure if they were completely honest with h him "Clearly you three have simply made a mistake, but Lord Yronwood will still need what you harvested. How much crops did you collect?""From the land of the Hand? It were 10 acres, so about 200 sacks of crops alltogether, m'Lord." The younger one said "but we didn't use them yet.""Good you will send those back to Yronwood, together with 10 sacks of crops from each of you as an apology."

Tears were running down her face.“I… this is my fault…” the woman said crying while she held the dead babe in her arms “It… We never should have…”“No.” Domeric said close to tears himself “No, don’t say that… We can’t let this thoughts bring us down!”“But-“ Myra wanted to cry out, but her husband embraced her tightly. It wasn’t long before she began crying in his shoulder. “We… We should never have… I am just too old…”“No, no you are not. It was just…” Domeric didn’t know what to say except: “Maybe the gods wanted to tell us that we should still wait…” He felt stupid for what he just said, but his wife was more religious than he was or ever will be.He felt her shaking her head “Or that I am too-““Don’t say that. We could always try it again someday if you want.” He tried to comfort her “What do you think?”Myra sobbed in his arms “I- If you want to do that?”“Of course I would want.” Domeric said, gently placing a soft kiss on his wife’s head.--------------------The night Domeric lay awake for long hours before he sat up from his bed and glanced at Myra. She was asleep, but the sadness still filled her face. It broke Domeric inside to see her like this.They had decided to name the girl nonetheless. Roslin they named her. Domeric wasn’t sure what to do after he rose from bed, but as he glanced through the room, his thoughts wandered. What could have become of the child?It wasn’t too long after that he sat at the desk in their room with a small candle lit and a piece of paper before him. The quill in his hand shook for a moment before he began to write. ---*Dear Roslin,**Your mother and I will always love you, no matter what. Pardon us for failing you so early. But know that we will always remember you.**While lying awake in the middle of the night, I started to wonder. What could have become of you? Maybe wife to a Lord? Maybe you would have taken after your mother like Lyle? Became a fearless girl with the temper of a viper, cunning like a fox?* *Maybe you would have taken after me instead? Who knows, maybe you would have become like your sister, beautiful, smart and dangerous.  A beauty to behold, but dangerous.**The truth hurts me too much than to admit it, but I will never know…**Love, forever,**your  father*---When he finished the letter, Domeric let out a sigh and read it again. With each time reading it through, he could imagine his daughter clearer.  Dark hair like her mother, pale skin like her sister and brother and his glowing green eyes. Dancing around in a field of flowers, she laughed and sang.It broke his heart when the flames of the candle licked at the piece of paper.The letter slowly burning away, he closed his eyes, trying to hold in his tears.He failed.

2fnms8	-31668	1410028807	asoiafpowers	[Lore] Honor, Courage, Love	The sun was setting over the sea when Mantarys Sand entered his chambers. He was glad every time he could return here. It was home for the last few years now.He unclasped his golden cloak and carefully laid it aside. It was his symbol. His symbol, that he had accomplished something. He wasn’t Mantarys, the bastard of the Tor anymore. He was Mantarys of the Sunguard now.His whole life, his younger brother Othel had pushed him down. Reminded him of what he was. A bastard. And only because of their father he was even allowed at the seat of House Jordayne. Never did it come to Othel’s mind that all he did to Mantarys, all the insults he threw at him, all the accusations when he destroyed his own toys, they didn’t break him, they made him stronger. He learned early in live what he truly valued.  The Honor, to stand up for your own deeds.  The Courage, to lay down your own life to defend others. And Love. The Love, that keeps you going, even if the end is close. His siblings always saw him as brother, except Othel of course. But he never felt welcome in their Hall, at their table, or within their walls. When he came of age, he joined the Tor’s watch, so he could at least become *someone*. But he still was the Bastard of Antario Jordayne. He never felt accepted in the rows of the Tor’s watch, even when he was voted to become the Captain of the Watch, he still couldn’t help but feel in the wrong place. It was when his father died and the new Lord Jordayne came to him. Domeric asked him to become Commander of the Tor’s army, should there ever be need of them. He still remembered Othel’s burning glare when Domeric announced it to their siblings. Mantarys never understood why Othel hated him, despised him. For him, Othel was still his brother no matter what.He was shaken out of his thoughts as someone wrapped his arms around his leg. Small wonder, when he glanced down he saw Maron smile up to him.Mantarys knew his son though, every time he was greeted like this, the boy had done something bad.“What was it this time?” He asked with a sigh as he got down on his knee to be on one level with his son.“He drew something on the walls of the classroom.” Liane, the serving girl that became Maron’s translator.Ever since Ja’qo Naheri taught Maron to write, he was out for trouble “What?”Liane crossed her arms “Ask him.” After asking his son, Mantarys couldn’t help but laugh when Maron began to explain that he drew how the teacher was put into a small room, filled with scorpions, vipers and other poisonous creatures. The teacher and Ja’qo, who helps the teacher with the deaf children, however came into the room before he could finish his masterpiece and were infuriated by his art.“Oh, don’t encourage him!” Liane said upset “You can be happy Ja’qo knows him for so long already!”“I know…” Mantarys said as he rose to his feet again and looked at his son.He knew he had to be hard on him, but he knew what happens when you are too hard with your children. Elyn had taught him that when she ran away to avoid the marriage their father had set up.With a slightly angered expression on his face, he ordered Maron to go to his room immediately.“What, you just send him in the room for the rest of the evening?” Liane asked surprised “I mean-“She was interrupted by Mantarys when he placed a kiss on her lips. After a moment of surprise, Liane returned the kiss eagerly. When they broke apart, Mantarys looked in her eyes. This. This was so much more than he ever wanted. Honor and acceptance in what he did, Pride in doing it and most of all, the Love of someone. Having Maron and Liane meant everything to him and he dreaded the day he would need to leave them behind when the Prince’s life was in danger. Mantarys hand gently touched Liane’s slightly swollen belly. He wished he had given her the Crown of Love and Beauty at the joust during the Allyrion wedding.  She really was the most beautiful women under the skies that day. For him, at least. Lady Gargalen did repay them for his gift, but it was Liane he really wanted to crown. Prince Martell was understanding enough to let the Sunguard have bastards, but he did not dare to let him know about him and Liane. They were not married, but Mantarys was sure the Prince wouldn’t approve of a relationship like this.Wrapping her arms around his chest, Liane placed a kiss on his cheek “What are you thinking about, my knight in shining armor?”“How much I love you.” Mantarys replied with a smile.The blood red light of the setting sun disappeared behind the horizon when they entered their bedroom.

House Quill was long ago founded by a bastard of Jordayne, who became a landed knight. Their sigil is a Silver quill surrounded by red flame on blue.“My Lord?” he asked with a bow “What can I do?”“Do you know how to quarter a man?” Domeric asked. He had no love for like men before him, who are hunting helpless men for hunting’s sake.Ser Petyr looked surprised “No, my Lord.”“Very well then,” Domeric said with a nod “hang them. But not here.

To Domeric’s left sat his wife Myra, Lyle, his new wife Serra and Domeric’s siblings, to his right was Nymeria and the honor guest of the Tor.“My Prince, Family, Friends, fellow Dornish. Before we begin with the feast, I want to make a toast.” Domeric said as he stood up and raised his cup “To the brave men that laid down their lives in order to defend Starfall and the cousins of my Daughter-in-Law’s family. They will be remembered as heroes. The 1,145 men that died that horrible day will be remembered in song and tale, when they pushed back Tarly with all his might.” After he lowered his cup, he looked at it for a moment and raised his voice again “And let us not forget the dead Reachmen… May they find peace in death, as their Lord would not grant them such in life…”After the toast, he smiled at all his guest "Now, enjoy the drinks, enjoy the foods! After the feast, we will Ride for glory in a Horse Race or a Joust!"**[M] RP-away, guys!****Edit: this takes place before the news of the rebellion reached Dorne.**
2g7mig	-31668	1410538630	asoiafpowers	[EVENT] Baby, don't you cry	Most of the Jordaynes sat outside of Maester Ulwyck's keep. A few hours ago, Sarra's water broke and she and Lyle went to the old man.Domeric and Myra were both worried for their daughter-in-law. The last years had seemed as if House Jordayne was cursed. First the former Lord Jordayne died of a terrible sickness of the bowels, then his sister Dorna died in childbirth with her son. And finally a year ago, Domeric and Myra's daugther, Roslin.Sarra's cries of pain had ceased a few minutes ago, but the cries of the babe followed soon afterwards.Nymeria shifted around nervously "Do you think... Do you think Sarra is alright?" She asked her father. They had become close friends since Sarra had married Lyle."I am sure he is." Myra told her daughter.It wasn't long after when the door to Maester Ulwyck's keep opened that Lyle stepped out.In his arms he cradled the small babe. Domeric immediatly noticed his son's redened eyes and shaking body. He walked over to them and held the child out to Domeric."Here, your granddaughter." He said with a weak smile.The girl had eyes white as pearls. He knew immediatly the girl was blind."Lyle!" He heard Myra call out to his son.As he looked up, he saw Lyle slowly walking back into the Maester's keep, Emerald Ink in his hand, dragging it along the ground."First my aunt and cousin... then my sister.... and now my wife!" Lyle yelled inside as he pushed Ulwyck back "You killed enough Jordaynes!"As Domeric ran into the room, Ulwyck laid on the ground, his head and Emerald Ink next to him. Lyle kneed next to where Sarra laid. The guards that were with them came into the room as well."Guards... take Lyle into custody..." Domeric said hesitant, but he had to.-----Lyle laid in one of the cells of the Tor, his hands wrapped arround his legs. What he had done was wrong, he knew that. He also knew that it would mean that his father would put him to the sword.Thinking about this made him shiver.*This man wasn't fit to serve as a Maester. He had too much blood on his hands.* Lyle thought.Sarra, his sweet Sarra was dead. They married this year and now she was gone, ripped out of his life as quick as she came into it. Sarra, his daughter was blind, with bright blond hair like many Daynes had.He regreted not seeing her grow up. Lyle knew she would be better off with Nymeria as her mother. *I will tell Father that that I want Nym to rais her* Lyle told himself while he started to cry for his wife again.-------A raven soon left for Sunspear.*Prince Maron,**I need your wise judgment. My son Lyle and his wife Sarra had a daughter not a fortnight ago.**Unfortunately, Sarra died in childbed and the girl, Sarra after her mother, is blind. In blind rage and grief, Lyle took my sword and struck down my Maester, Ulwyck, blaming him for all the bad that befell our family in the last years.**I can not judge my son fair. This is why I come to you. You are wise and just. Judge my son as you see fit and I will fullfil your sentence.**With heavy heart,**Domeric Jordayne, Lord of the Tor and Lord Treasurer***[M] brought to you by /u/rollme, that motherfucking bot...**
2gaiky	-31668	1410620462	asoiafpowers	[LORE] Comfort for a mother	Myra had to get out. Out of her husbands keep and into the small town around it. It wasn't Domeric however.It was what had happened. Her daughter-in-law dead. Her son in the dungeon. And her first grandchild... Sarra was a beautiful child, but her clear eyes made her look, unnatural, strange, like something not meant to be on this world.Myra made her way down to the markets, where fisher were selling arguably fresh fish from the Dornish sea, farmers who sold their crops and fruits and woman selling woven cloths.She walked past a yard with a carver working on something. A rather familiar face stood next to him."Septon Rodrick?" Myra asked, surprised to see the Septon here with the carver "What brings you here?""The gods, of course!" Rodrick said with a smile.Myra's curiosity was awoken "And what did they tell you to do?""Order idols for them to be made. And sell that ugly crystal..." Rodrick replied and showed her the seven idols the carver had already made for her "A anvil for the Smith, a sword for the Warrior, a scale for the Father, a babe for the Mother, a flower for the Maiden, a crooked old lantern for the Crone and a hood for the stranger."The Lady of the Tor glanced at the carver who worked on another piece of wood “And what is he working on now?”“An eight idol.” Rodrick replied “This one is for the smallfolk, they came to pray to another god than the seven. A new one.”“What are they praying for?” Myra asked him, not sure what to expect.“Peace, of course.” Rodrick sighed “With the Reach claiming what is left of the Seven Kingdoms, the people are worried, my Lady. Nobody wants yet another war on our homelands.”“It is true…” Myra said with a sigh.“How are you, my Lady?” the Septon asked her, seeing the worried expression on her face “You life must have been hard the last few weeks…”“Yes, it has…” Myra replied with a nod “First Sarra died, and now Lyle is in the dungeon, awaiting his sentence…”Rodrick touched her shoulder gently “You know that the Sept always stands open for you, my Lady. Come and pray with me for your family someday.”“I will.” Myra said with a nod as she took a step away from the Septon “I am best going back now.”“Do that…” Septon Rodrick said with a smile.
2gb1he	-31668	1410632760	asoiafpowers	[Random Event] What to do with a Viper	The last weeks have been tiring for Domeric and crippling headaches plagued for over a fortnight now.A young man in shackles was brought before him by one of the minor nobles of the Tor "This man murdered my son!""What do you say about this?" Domeric asked the accused, who looked like he was a knight."We had a duel and I defeated him." the young man said cocky "He had it coming. Comes from fucking my wife."The noble man almost pulled his sword out to strike the young knight down, but Domeric stopped him "I don't see any reason why he should be guilty of anything. A duel was his right as a knight.""That bastard poisoned his sword and murdered my son with it!" the nobleman yelled.Domeric raised an eyebrow, the yelling of the man made his headaches only worse "By all respect, we are Dornish. Not a generation back, we killed the Reachmen that were put here by the conquerors from north by putting scorpions in their bed, we poisoned our blades and spears, we fought dirty. I don't see why I should punish this lad for using the techniques his father and probably you as well used not too long ago against a common foe."The nobleman was outraged "But-""I will hear no more of it, begone!" Domeric interrupted him and send them away.**[M] lol, "questionable techniques" is a foreign concept in Dorne.** **Devotion +1**

Tyene yelled at the crowd "You need to listen!"The crowd, many of which were infected with the pale mare, did not listen however."Let me do this, Ty'..." Olymer said as he brought a horn out of the keep. Taking a deep breath, he blew the horn and the loud tone it created silenced the people for the moment.Tyene licked over her dry lips "Thank you... People of the Tor! I know this plague is hard, but trust me, we try our best to help. There will be water and food soon and we are going to-"Before she finished speaking, something hit her head and she fell to the ground. Jon and Gyles quickly grabbed her by the arms and carried her back into the keep. Tyene could hear the crowd roar out upset, cursing them."Jon, tell your father to take Quentyn and Arianne to Sunspear or the Water Gardens!" Gyles told Jon as the gate closed behind them, the guards trying their best to keep the mob out "I'll write a letter to the Princess. We need all the support we can get!""Gyles, what... what happened?" Tyene asked confused, blood running down the open wound on her head."Someone threw a stone or something and you went down... Everything is alright for now Ty..." he explained as the twins headed inside "I'll send Old Jon with your twins to Sunspear, so they are safe from the flux...""The... the people... we... we need to help them somehow." Tyene muttered as her body convulsed under the pain in here stomach."You need to think of yourself Ty..." Gyles told her as he opened his Waterskin and let her drink "Now, we need you to write letters..."---Not too much later ravens left the Tor.One was headed for Sunspear:*Princess Nymeria,**The Tor is facing colapse. Most of the town is infected with the Bloody Flux, but we barely have the resources to keep them fed under normal circumstances.**I beg you, my Princess, to send any food and water to us you can spare, we are in dire need for it. The life of many will depend on it...**Tyene Jordayne, Lady of the Tor*---The second letter was coppied by the maester several times and the ravens flew to all holds of the Red Mountains and Dornish Marches.*Dear Lords and Ladies of the Marches and Red Mountains,**The Bloody Mare rides at the Tor and most likely in some of your holds as well. However, we are facing a colapse, hundreds of refugees have arrived in hopse of help, but we can not provide it alone.**I will not beg to you for water or food, as you need it yourself. However I send a warning to all Lords and Ladies.* *Do not open your gates and harbors to people of the Tor! They are more likely infect than not.**Lady of the Tor, Tyene Jordayne*---The final letter was headed for King's Landing.*Dear Gwyn,**My worst fear has become real. The man with the Bloody Flux I told you about has died, but not before leaving hundrets of infected...**I beg you to report this to the King if he not knows already and ask for his support. I am afraid I and aunt Jonella contracted the disease as well, but at the time, it is not as severe as with some of the smallfolk.**We need help!**Tyene*After Gwyneth read the letter, she immediatly headed for the throneroom to speak to the king about this matter as soon as possible.

Gyles had already send a raven to Sunspear for his uncle to return home with the kidsHe didn't dare report about his aunt's death by raven. *It will be hard enough this way...* he thought sad.Not three days ago, when the last traces of the mare were driven out of the Tor, Lady Jonella succumbered to the Bloody Flux.Gyles looked from the solar out over the Tor. To the east, pitch black smoke still rose. He had ordered every dead to be brought a mile away from the town and burned. Quickly a few volunteers gathered and brought the dead there, burning them at the end of the day. Most days, the fire was still burning the next morning.Many refugees had to be send to Summerhall or other camps. Word has reached him that more than half of them did not make it.If it wasn't for the support of some Stormlord and the crown, the Tor might as well be a dead ruin now. "This year has been hard, hasn't it?" Olymer said next to him, looking out to the sea."Yeah... I won that tourney at King's Landing and almost won the melee as well..." Gyles said with a sigh "It looked like it would be a great year... Then everything went to shit..."Olymer nodded "Yes... the Bloody Flux hit us harder than anyone else as far as we know..." "Let's make this year a better one, little brother..." Gyles muttered, staring at the rising sun.---**TL;DR*** Gyles Jordayne was first in the Joust of King's Landing* Gwyneth Jordayne was send to King's Landing to become part of the King's court.* The Bloody Flux hit the Tor, it was close to collapse* Jonella Jordayne died of the Bloody Flux

I should be able to do that.”“Don’t be too mean to poor Jon, Ty.” Gyles told his twin sister “Not that he is angry when the Lady arrives.”“Speaking of which, I think that is her.” Tyene said as she saw riders approaching.When the gate closed behind them and the dust had settled, Tyene approached Rhaenrya and mate a small bow “My Lady, I wish you welcome at the Tor. We have made preparations for a feast in your honor, if you are not too full of feasts already. But first, let me introduce you to my brother and my cousin.”“Gyles Jordayne, it is an honor to have you here at the Tor, my Lady.” Gyles said with a smile.Jon stepped forward and took Rhaenrya’s hand and kissed it “Jon Jordayne, I will make sure you are safe within our walls.” He said with a smile.

Gyles commanded each time he swung his wooden sword at his nephew "Right. Below!"With a single stroke from the wooden sword, he brought Quentyn to fall."And just like that, I have a dead squire..." Gyles muttered with a smirk."Behind!" Someone yelled and a split second afterward, he felt a sharp pain between his shoulderblades.With an surprised outcry, he went down on his knees and felt the wooden sword on his neck."I will accept your surrender now, Ser Gyles" his niece, Arianne said with a grin."I am sorry, my lady..." Gyles muttered with a smirk "But am I right claiming you once again skipped your history lessons?"Arianne looked surprised at her uncle "How-"Gyles took her moment of surprise to take the wooden sword, rip it out of her hands and jump back to his feet. He gently tapped her head with the hilt of the wooden blade."Two dead children. Your mother would be devastated...""If this were real swords, you would be dead twice as much as we!" Arianne said with a smile, sticking out her tongue."And if you would have paid attention in your history lessons with the Maester, you would know something very important." Gyles told her "You asked me to surrender, Ari. Now guess why that was a mistake?"Both his nephew and niece shrugged their shoulders, not knowing the answer "We are Dornish, girl. No matter how dire the situation. No matter how small the chance of winning. We won't surrender!""So, you will not surrender, even when surrounded?" Quentyn asked with a smirk, exchanging looks with his twin sister "Attack!"Both leaped towards him, Gyles barely managed to fend off the twins attacks.As they finally brought him to fall, all three of them started to laugh."Now go you little pests, your mother probably wants to see you!" He told them as they walked into the castle.*"It was so stupid..."* he thought to himself as he entered his room. He pulled his leather gloves from his hands and flung it on a small table.*"We were young, stupid and curious..."* Gyles thought angry when he dropped into his bed. Even though it wasn't even midday, he was too tired to stand.A knocking on the door kept him from slipping into sleep "I am not here, go away."The door opened nonetheless and someone sat down beside him.As someone ruffled his hair, Gyles looked up to see his sister."What where you doing with Quentyn? He has bruised all over his body." She asked, a bit upset."Training. He wants to be my squire, so I train him..." Gyles muttered, buring his face in a pillow again."He is not going to be your squire! He could be-""Killed?" Gyles interrupted her "I am fucking turney knight! The only way I could get him killed is by training him badly and knighting him!" He pushed himself up from his bed and now stood in front of her "I am not one of those idiot Reachknights that think winning a tourney is like winming a real war. Because the gods know, if we would ever go to war, I'd die! And if this ever happens, I swear to the gods, I will keep him safe!""Why?" Tyene asked him "Why would you do this for him?""Because he is your son, Ty!" He told her with all honesty he had."He is YOURS as well!" She told him "Since when do you not despise them, anymore!""I NEVER despised them!" Gyles yelled at her."It was a mistake to do it. You should get Moon Tea from the Maester. Why are you keeping it?" Tyene mimicked his voice, badly "You never despised them, huh?""If we had told anybody, the fucking Septon would have burned us all on a stake! No matter if we are highborn or not!" Gyles told her, opening his door "Ever since they were born, I did everything in my power to keep their father secret. And now Ty I am tired...""So... you do care for them?"

Tyene told him with a smile, looking out towards the Red Mountains."But why do we need to ride there?" her brother asked with a frown."Because there is a storm out on the sea. Waiting for it to settle down might take longer than just riding there..." Jon told him as he rode up to them in his full armor. Together with 20 men, he was protecting his cousins."And we need to ride the whole way back as well?" "No, hopefully the storm has settled then and we can go by ship."

She was glad that the fate of their parents hadn't befallen her and her brother. However, she was still sunken in thought. While traveling, a letter from home arrived, with a second letter from Old Oak, inviting the Lords of Dorne, the Reach and Stormlands to a joust  in honor to his daughter's nameday, not too late after their arrival.

The salty dornishman above him asked with a smirk "You and your sister can burn together with all of that Dragon scum for all I care!""You just don't get it into your head, do you?" Gyles asked as he wiped away blood from the corner of his mouth "Neither the Hand nor the Regent are helping the Targaryens. In fact, I am pretty certain they do exactly what the smallfolk wants!"Unnoticed by the taller man, Gyles hand closed around his half full cup of ale."Oh, and also, you know what we do here with troublemakers?" he asked with a cocky grin."I don't care, you are here ruling, so you are wrong!" the man said as he swung his fist after Gyles.He danced to the side and laughed as the man stumbled forward "Ah, that kind you are, eh?" he asked, before smashing the cup against the back of the man's head.A few men stood around, watching, but nobody dared to intervene in the brawl.Gyles looked down at the man with a smile "So, I guess you give up then?""Never!" the man yelled and lunged forward, trying to drive a small dagger into the knight's stomach.Even thought he turned aside before the dagger went through his belly, it cut through his jerkin and ripped open the skin beneath. *Belly...* He thought again as he stopped himself from clutching the bleeding wound.With a swift motion, he grabbed the man by his black hair and slammed him face first into the bar of the alehouse. As his nose broke, blood splashed all over the bar and the floor."Uhm... Sorry..." Gyles said as he wiped his bloody hand off on the man's shirt and put a piece of gold on the counter "Anybody else thinks it's a good idea to attack a knight who simply wanted to enjoy his ale and some peace and quiet?"After nobody answered him, most of them simply looking on the ground, Gyles nodded "Good... And if that man wakes up again, tell him that the loyalties of the Jordaynes always have and always will lie with the Martells and Dorne. Thanks..."
2mv4jx	-31668	1416477524	GoTPowers	[Random Event] Who put that there?	"Lord Gyles, you have to see this!" the Maester called after him as he walked through a corridor."What are you talking about, Rodrick?" the acting Lord of the Tor asked the northerner confused "Did something happen?""Yes! A few men found a hidden door in one of the cellars! I think it predates even Nymeria's arrival!" "Huh..." Gyles muttered, surprised "Well... that's interesting... Anything in it?""YES!" The man said exited like a small child "It seems that it was the place where King Lucifer Dryland was held before Nymeria send him to the wall!""What makes you think that?" Gyles asked confused.He read about Lucifer Dryland of Brimstone, the old Holdfast lying close to Ghost Hill, near the tip of Dorne. On the side of a single mountain, that was said to spew fire ages ago, the black stone castle was build, but when Nymeria arrived, not even the Brimstone held her back."Come and I show you, my lord." Rodrick said and lead him down into the cellar he talked about.Armed with torches, the two entered the small room."Here, I looked in the books about the Houses of Dorne and their Histories and I am most certain that this is his shield." Maester Rodrick said as he handed the shield to Gyles.The knight took it and inspected it. It was a masterly crafted bronze shield with inlaid black stones and leather strapped over the front, to show the Coat of Arms of House Dryland, a black mountain, the peak covered in fire."Who put this here?" he asked the Maester as he turned the shield around."I don't know, but the Jordaynes supported Nymeria, hoping to regain their own status as Kings of the Tor." Rodrick explained "Maybe they were the ones that Captured the last of the Drylands?"On the inside of the shield was a dagger in its sheath.The Dagger wasn't made of Steel or Bronze however, it was made of a pitch black stone. Sharp as a razor, as Gyles noted as his fingers bled when running them over the edge."Dragonglass." Maester Rodrick told him "But what shall we do with it."I will keep the dagger for now..." Gyles said as he put the sheath on his belt "Bring the shield in the library, it is truly a work of art. The people should see it as well. But make sure it is guarded, so nobody will take it away."---**+1 XP**

For one, Prince Lewyn is now old enough to be fostered and maybe should become a squire soon as well. Second, there have been no significant reports of the anti-Targaryen movement since Lord Uller's execution, however, this does not mean that there aren't at least some that still want to harm Prince Lewyn... And finally, my cousin send me a letter from King's Landing and she told that the King has been absent for almost two years now... and of some rumors from the east of... black dragons."Tyene looked in the round as she finished looking at each of the Councilors. She knew that all of them where Dorne's finest, but she was worried that all this time in which the realm was silent might have caused them to become rusty...

2vmvxm	-31668	1423730839	IronThronePowers	[Lore] Meet the Jordaynes	Lucifer Jordayne sat in his solar, a empty flaggon of strongwine on his table. Scattered on the table were many letters, maps and charts that he had to read as the Lord of the Tor.He cursed his mother for having him as her firstborn rightful son. Why couldn't the bastard twins become the ruler? He much rather would have become a knight and traveled Westeros, but this wasn't the way the story went.After their father died, Lady Tyene stepped down as Lady of the Tor and gave the burden to him, Lucifer."Cursed are you, mother..." the tall, light haired man muttered as he slowly rose to his feet. The strongwine showed its effects, as it pulled on Lucifer's shoulders, trying to pull him down.Stumbling through the halls, past the great Weirwood door that lead to the Library of the Jordayne, Lucifer made his way to his chambers. As he reached them, he drunkenly let himself fall into his bed, beside his Lady wife. The darkness of sleep quickly embraced him, pulling him deeper and deeper.----Allayne woke as her husband dropped into their bed, stinking of wine. Lately, he had done this often. A soft snoring immediately began to come from the drunk man lying beside her. With a sigh, she swung her feet out of the bed and looked out the window, over the Dornish sea. The water shimmered red from the slowly rising sun, as did the sky. She and Lucifer had been married for over twenty years now, and ever since his Lady Mother stepped down as the Lady of the Tor and Hand of the Prince, he began drinking more and more.Even though she loved her husband, she sometimes hated him, for dropping completely drunk into their bed and falling asleep.Allayne ran her hand over her husband’s head, before kissing him on the forehead and leaving to organize the everyday life of the people of the Tor.----The cracking of the man’s jaw brought a smile on Trebor’s face. With a loud crash, the other man dropped into the table, unconscious.With a smile, Trebor whipped away the blood dropping from his broken lip.“You are going to pay that!” the innkeeper yelled infuriated at him, his fingers clenching around a club with smears of blood on it.The young man pulled a single gold coin out of his pocket and threw it to the innkeeper  “Keep the change…”Trebor looked around at the four men that tried to start a brawl with him. One of them with a broken jaw, lying spread over the table, the other with his leg bending into an unnatural direction and the third sitting on a chair, clutching his hand that Trebor smashed with his cup.The fourth looked shocked at his friends and then at the young Lord. “You want some as well or did you learn your lesson already?” Trebor asked him, ready to land another punch “If so, bring them to Maester Jon once they wake up. He will know you come.”“Y- Y- Yes M’lord.” The man stuttered.-----Tyene sat at the water, watching the children play. She remembered the time when her own children all came here. They all loved playing in the cool waters of the Water Gardens.  A sigh escaped her as she thought about them.The Twins, Quentin and Arianne, she considered them, or rather what lead to their birth, as one of the biggest mistakes in her life. Her twin Gyles and her had mistaken sibling love for real love and it did not take too long that the realized their mistake. However, she never wanted to drink the Moon Tea… The truth is, she loved the twins almost more than her other children, as they were so much like herself and her brother, but she hoped, not in every aspect.Lucifer and Gyles, her two sons from Valarr, her heirs. They loved playing in the Water Gardens, as did all the children around her. Gyles was always a troublemaker, always getting into fights.In the end, this caused him to be exiled to Essos.  Tyene did however not like remembering what her son did to be exiled, it still hurt to remember.Lastly Sarella, she was a late child in every way. Born over ten years after Gyles, she came as a surprise to all. For long, most of the people believed her to be a boy when they first saw her, as she tend to keep her hair short. Ever since however, Sarella became more and more a woman. But not a true Lady, rather a somewhat strange one.  Years ago she found the Red God and lives to worship him now.A child came over to her, blood running from his forehead “Lady Ty, why don’t you play with us?” he asked with a big smile.“I’m sorry my dear, I fear I am too old to keep up with you.” She said with a smile and gently wiped away the blood “Also, don’t hurt yourself and your friends too much. I don’t think your parents would like if you bash out your brains in the Water Gardens. There are enough Blood Oranges spreading red around here…”---Through muscle and sinew the blade cut, allowing blood to spill, outcries to end and a head to fall to the ground. With disgust, he spit on the body that dropped to the ground and walked away. “Hoped you learn your lesson…” he muttered as he walked away.“But you didn’t listen, you stubborn fool!” he yelled at the body, slowly bleeding out into the sand “Don’t mess with me!”With a grunt, he turned and walked away from his former business partner. He had to be taught a lesson. And Gyles Jordayne isn’t the best of teachers…
2y5ilx	-31668	1425662367	IronThronePowers	[Lore] Fool me once, Shame on me. Fool me twice...	Azazel was scared. The fold over his eyes didn't allow him to see what was going on around him, but he could feel it. Ropes tied around his wrists and ankles, he was straped to a stone, naked, the sun burning on his back."Az, Az, Az... You will never learn it will you?" His capturer said, while aparently whetting a blade.With a kick and a awful loud crack, one of his legs broke as the man broke Azazel's leg.After he stopped screaming, Azazel's blindfold was removed and he stared in the piercing green eyes of the other man."You know, Az, there is this saying in Westeros..." the man said as he walked around Azazel dagger in hand "Fool me once, shame on me...""Gyles, please!" He started to beg "I- I never would have-""Fool me twice..." the dornish interrupted him "Shame on you!"Unbearable pain suddenly flamed up in Azazel's lower body and shortly after, blood ran down his legs."Usually this is how Dothraki treat disobedient slaves in their Kalahsar..." Gyles explained as he came back from behind Azazel, one of his hands covered in blood and carying something "First they bind them to a stone or tree, for each rider who passes by and feels like it to have his way... When they are gone then come the dogs and whatnot... And finally, the vultures and ravens come, picking them appart.""You- You can't do this to me!" Azazel yelled out at the top of his lungs "We are partners!""Oh, partners. That's what we are now?" Gyles asked surprised, crossing his arms "So that's why you tried to sell me to slavers twice and nearly got me killed more than I  am willing to count?"He continued on to pull out his sword. It was a longsword with a golden guard that formed a quill that seemingly drew the blade."You know, one of my ancestors roamed Essos before. They called her the Emerald Bitch, because of her eyes..." he put the blade back in its sheath "I really wish I could have met her... Always figured she would have liked me..."Gyles continued to stuff whatever he was holding into Azazel's mouth."If you were a better 'Partner', I would consider covering your eyes again..." he said as he walked to his horse "But you deserve it, Az... Now,  I guess it is farewell now. I hope we don't meet again. And you as well!"Muffled screams of terror followed after Gyles for the better part of an hour until Azazel either blacked out from the bloodloss or died.Gyles really didn't care. He was more concerned with the what now.There was only one place for him to go now...
2z5pn3	-31668	1426451865	IronThronePowers	[Event] A Ride for Kingsgrave	The horse was tired, Sarella knew and so was she.For days she rode, only stopping to rest, so she would be at her destination quickly.Yronwood and Skyreach came and went by. She couldn't believe her brother at first as he asked her to come to his solar."I need you to ride for Kingsgrave, sister." Lucifer had told her "There you will talk with Lady Manwoody and  propose a trade with us-"At this point she stopped listening, knowing that he wouldn't care if she told him to ask someone else to do the talking.She wasn't really interrested in whatever he wanted of Lady Manwoody, but she would still go. Kingsgrave had a certain *pull* for her to go, anyway.Before he send her off however, Lucifer pulled out an sealed envelope and put it in a small leather bag. On the question what was in it, he let out a sigh and started explaining it to her, ending with him giving her the envelope."Promise me Sarella. The only person who will read this letter is Lady Manwoody!" He told her before letting go of her and the letter."Now go, ride like the wind and be sure to not forget what I primarly send you to Kingsgrave for!" Lucifer had told her as a farewell."You wanted trade with them... I'll make sure you get trade, brother..." Sarella muttered to herself as Kingsgrave came into view.One last time, she put her heels in the sides of her horse, and rode at the already opening gate...

31obcz	-31668	1428356110	IronThronePowers	[Event] The Lost Son returns home	The sea was calm as the small ship laid anchor at the small harbor of the Tor. Men immediately began unloading what little cargo the ship had loaded.From inside the captain’s cabin, a man with dark brown hair, a graying beard, tan skin and emerald green eyes emerged, an apple in his hand.“First Mate Samson!” he yelled out as he took a bite of the apple “To me!”“Yes, C’ptain?” he asked, clearly uncomfortable around the man.“Seeing as you Captain had an *accident* and I only took over until we arrived here, congratulations are in Order, Captain Samson!”  the dornish said with a smile as he handed the apple to the first mate.“Th- Thanks, but it wasn’t an accident, you-“ Samson tried to insist, but he was shushed by the dornishman.“Now, Now Samson, accidents happen, no need to fancy them as something else.” His dagger glimmered in the sun as he proceeded to carefully cut open the man’s cloth at his belly.“O- Of course!”With a smile, the man put his dagger away and left the ship “Very good, now, farewell!” ---It didn’t take the man long to arrive at the gate leading inside the castle, where he was immediately stopped by two young guardsmen, who blocked his way with their spears.A smirk crept on the man’s face “Well, Well, Well. There are two ways this can go, boys. Either you let me through and we all are happy.” He proceeded to slowly pull out his sword from it sheath “Or, I can ruin your day and go through. The choice is yours.”The guardsmen looked at each other before lowering their spears and pointing them at him.“We will not let scum like you enter the halls of Lord Jordayne!” one of them shouted at him “Now, be gone or we end you!”“Very well then…” the man said as he drew his sword “Let it begin…”The younger of the two guardsmen was first to attack, pushing forward his spear, aiming for the men’s chest.  He missed however,  as his target moved slightly to the side, letting the spear only scratch over his vest, cutting the leather in half.With a single movement of his arm, he disarmed the young man and brought him down to his knees, screaming in pain.“Now, I do not want to kill you, you see?” he told the older man “Only to go through. So now tell me, do I have your permission to enter, or do I need to cut off your arms at the elbows as I did with the boy’s?”With an angry grumble, the man put away his spear and came to the younger guards help “May the gods take your live for this!”“There are no gods…” the man said with a smile as he entered the castle.---Lucifer Jordayne sat in the great Hall of the Tor, a book in his lab, reading. The warm light of the sun came through the windows behind him and illuminated the pages of the old book.He looked up as he heard the door of the hall open up. He froze as he recognized the man that had just entered his home.“The lost son returns home!” the man said, his hands outstretched and a grin on his lips “It has been too long, brother!”“Not long enough…” Lucifer told his brother as he put his book aside and rose to his feet “You have been exiled for live! And you have not been pardoned!”“Oh, but surely, you forgive your brother.” The man said, wrapping an arm around his brother’s shoulder “After all, we *are* blood…”“You murdered innocent people! You allowed a whole village to be whipped of the maps, just so you can have your fun! You deserved to be exiled! You deserved death!” Lucifer yelled at his brother.“Now, now, don’t be so hurtful, dear Lucifer!” the younger of the two men told his elder brother “After all, we haven’t seen each other in twenty years!”“And I would gladly make it another twent-“ the Lord of the Tor growled, but was interrupted as Gyles drove a blade between his rips.“You look tired, brother…” he said with a gentle voice as he slowly sat him back on his chair “Why don’t you sit down and go back to your book?”Lucifer stared blankly at his brother as he was sat on his chair and given his book, too weak to hold it or say something.“I will go and say hello to Allayne and Trebor.” Gyles said as he whipped off the blood of his dagger and slid it back in its scabbard “Anything I should tell them?”With a laugh, he exited the Great Hall again, telling the Guards that the Lord of the Tor does not want to be bothered any longer.

He couldn't help but smile as she looked up to him, now under his protection.After they spoke their vows and the Septon declared them man and woman, together they lead the guests from the sept to the Great Hall of the Tor, where a feast was already prepared.The newlyweds took their place at the dais and waited for everybody to take a seat, before Trebor rose again."Thank you to all of you for coming here today!" he exclaimed with a smile on his lips and a cup of Dornish Red in his hand "But my biggest thanks goes to Lord Yronwood, who allowed me to wed his beautiful daughter!

There was a constant stream of people bringing their kids down the aisle, yelling "HEY ROSS!  IT'S HIS FIRST GAME!"  and holding their kid up like it was a coupon.  Ross would duck down into the dugout and pop back up to toss the kid a ball.  It happened at least a dozen times.  (McCann was catching that night.)I miss Ross.  :(

It's in direct sunlight for maybe 5-6 hours.  It's a Native Watercraft Inuit 12.5' touring kayak.  I keep reading that I shouldn't leave it outside in sunlight because it'll heat up in the Sun and get disfigured.  Is that a real danger for bigger kayaks?  The plastic seems really thick to get disfigured so easily.  Should I be worried?  What if I slung it on my porch and let it sit out in direct sunlight for a whole day?  Would it take several days in direct sunlight to make a difference?

Although I typically back projects done by big names, the Grimrock (which I loved) was created by very small indy team as well and I loved that game. So I'm willing to give a creator here benefit of the doubt and back him.

So I'm personally not only excited to see Might and Magic going back to roots that I love, but also seeing how AAA is responding to latest player trend (rather than telling them what to play) with what seems like a type of RPG that is NOT geared towards "everyone" but a niche that enjoys that type of play.So beside discussing [game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=K4IxhUtZlgY) itself, I think it opens up a discussion on how all these kickstarter projects/indie games are finally making an impact how big studios are beginning to see things here. Any thoughts?

Stability of the library/tool is the most important thing, so I don't care if it's open source or something I can buy (the purchase option of course means that I buy it once but it becomes part of my application which I'm selling) as long as it has a good history of support to keep up with OS's and bugs.3.

2mt23j	-31687	1416430462	Guildwars2	Question about COOP play and difficulty	I'm thinking of playing this game with my friend as a coop and I was wondering how much freedom I have here for challenges? For example, when I played coop on WoW it was very linear and super easy, it felt like we were going through motions of a story since everything felt pretty easy to kill.Does this game allow me to maybe skip an area or access some more challenging ones and not punish me for it (eg: I skipped important part of the story that I have to come back to, there are quests which are disabled because I have to go back to easier area to get them, etc.)? Thanks!
2zde1r	-31687	1426613632	elderscrollsonline	Difficulty for 2 players	So me and my brother enjoy a good round of MMORPGS here and there but what we find really annoying about them is a lot of times we feel like "going through paces" rather than being challenged or making interesting decisions of skipping quests for more difficult ones. WoW was the worst offender when it comes to that but Guild Wars 2 was also in a similar vein where we felt like we had to do things in order cause if you skip it's way too difficult, but if you stick to set path then it's too easy. KOTOR Online was better because it had these side "difficult" quests which were actually pretty fun, required 2 of us and sometimes gave good loot. But how is Elder Scrolls Online when it comes to this?

I had this sort of thing on 1440p and 1080p, so question is this normal and/or should I modify certain game settings here? Or just accept it that when I have all this stuff in front of me the game will be doing this slowness here and there? (I have 4790k CPU with 16 gigs of ram and SSD HD)

I did, however, have a nightmare experience in Noblesville last year that encouraged me to show up extra early the next time he came to St. Louis and I caught Brandi Carlile. Nothing notable except for when Dave came out and did a song with her which was pretty cool and I normally would have missed it.I don't know if he does this regularly, but I was pleasantly surprised. I'll be there early this year at Noblesville just in case.EDIT: I searched through my videos and found a clip I recorded and figured I'd upload it. Here you go:http://youtu.be/K7dQLDSwLc8

I'm not saying I'm an expert, but I'm sure there are many other intelligent, helpful people that would love to shine some light on the series for you.What jokes from "Frasier" do you not get?

I see that they just got a new shipment of the Glenfarclas 40-year-old, and the price is now $599. I bought the same bottle there a couple years ago for $400 or $450. These guys are always very fair on price (Green Spot is $45, Tun 1401 is $250), so I know this increase is being forced upon them by their supplier. I had heard the price of scotch was going up, but I had no idea it was going to be this significant! If you were thinking about buying a bottle of this delicious whiskey, I would look for it now at the lower price.

If you're not familiar with the 800-series WFE's, you can read a little bit about them here:  http://smokybeast.blogspot.com/2014/05/the-pilgrimage-to-bourbon-country-one.html        In terms of a swap value for these WFE's, I'd value them about equal to recent WLWs and to the Vintage and Rittenhouse, and about half the value of something like a JPS17 or PHC4.  This is my best guess, however, as secondary market values of single barrel Willetts are difficult to determine.  What I can say for certain is that retail price on these in Germany was $150 when they were released about a year ago.        And if you happen to have a PVW20/23, PHC2, AHH16 or some other mega-bottle that you'd be interested in swapping, I also have some other interesting stuff like EHT Tornado, FR125, B25, etc that I would definitely love to put together a package towards.  Thanks!
28z49d	-31703	1403626103	ScotchSwap	ISO PVW 15/20 for Bday Present; FT: WTAS, M10B, Bourye, 4R125, 4R 2014 SBLE, SW Old Fitz, ECBP, 2013 OFBB, etc.	A good friend's 40th birthday is coming up, and I'd love to be able to give him a PVW15/20 as a present, mostly because I know he'd immediately open it up and drink it with me!  I'm willing to go in loud and heavy (at least from my perspective) and throw the above bottles into some sort of combination deal.  The WTAS is a 15 year old Wild Turkey American Spirit (with box).  The Michters is a 10 year old bourbon, barrel 2336 (older batch) - two available.  The Bourye is Bourye (not Son of Bourye).  The 4R125 is the 700ml bottle, and I have four of those available.  The SW Old Fitz is a 1971 ceramic decanter in beautiful condition - so the bourbon inside is from the 60's.  Photos and/or more details available upon request.      For a PVW15, I'd be willing to do something like 2:1 out of the WTAS, M10, Bourye, 4R125/SBLE, SW Old Fitz bottles, plus something like ECBP, OFBB, W12, ETL, etc. as a sweetener.        For a PVW20, I could probably do 3:1 on those bottles plus the sweetener.        If I can't track down any 15/20, I'd be interested in other VW bottles, and of course I'm always looking for Balcones V bottles (though I keep those for myself!). Thanks!

So Ill make this quick, I'm in highschool and i found out someone has been stealing my homework and putting their name on it, i at first thought the teacher was making mistakes, then i got smart and check the teacher's pile and found my assignments with their name on it. so should i rat him out and get him in trouble and fix my grades, or anything else (like telling him to do those assignments and sneak it in the teacher's pile, then i tell the teacher that they made a mistake)additional info: i dont really know this guy, he does drugs, and he owes my $40 (and probably has no intent of repaying) from over a year ago. ONE MORE THING: when i confronted him about it on fb without saying what he did wrong, he acted like he did nothing wrongtl;dr snake classmate steals my hw, should i rat him out?

It really sucks having shitty teammates. Clever Amy Pulsar is one of the biggest elo inflaters in the game, 3388 elo with skill of a bronze and DCs every game that he loses, giving the enemy team massive elo, 3388 elo is double burple or triple burple, now think about how much elo the winning team gains just for being better than this nub

1zro5b	-31805	1394152899	IndieGaming	Just finished a teaser trailer with the helped of the community!	Hello Everyone,I'd like to share the teaser trailer for my still in-development game [Universe Edge](http://universe-edge.com) ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjEeuf-K9GM ), which is a sort of sandbox, where you can build spaceships, manage your crew and explore the universe ( land on finite-size planets, mine asteroids ).A few months ago, I have announced that I will be using community-built ships for the trailer, at this time, I really have no fan base, aside from several followers from twitter, and watchers from IndieDB. I was alone in the forum.I am not sure on how did they find the game but I posted the "Ship Builder" on GameJolt, Kongregate, itch.io, I have also posted on Steam Concept. I'm amazed on how much dedication and time the players has put into it, even though the "Ship Builder" version of the game is still on raw condition and tedious to use.There are now a few active people in the forums and gives me a lot of motivation to work on the game, and shares their idea. my next plan is to go Greenlight and Kickstarter. The scope of the game is quite open ended and there are still a lot of time ahead of the development.

( estimated June 2015, 14 months from now )For example, an X amount pledge will earn a person 0.1% in every month he/she pledge. So if he pledge for 14 months straight, he can earn up to 1.4%.* This will be a limited only award, so only several pledgers can pledge.* There's a lot of risk in this for the pledgers, things like the game not earning that much, me failing, etc.* A cap of total X amount is set, so if the pledgers already earned that amount, the profit share will stop.So it will be totally up to the pledger if he can trust me or believes that the game has potential. ( the game is already in development for 5 months )I've also emailed about this to the Patreon Team, and they don't prohibit it.This is my current idea for me to be able to work on the game full time, and I think I am finally crazy. Wow.Now, I don't really know what kind of business/legal/taxes matters involve on this, but I am pretty sure there will be some sort of paper work involve in this?With this, I will only lose like 30% of the share, but in return I will be able to finish the game.What do you guys think? Is this possible?Thank you!

Assuming someone will pledge, is this a good idea?My current plan is to start out with 20-30$ pledges for a few slots. Then if there are interest, I will add higher amounts, with a little increase % compared to the cheaper pledges. Until a projected 30% profit share is accumulated for all the pledges, I will stop adding.It's basically first come first serve thing.Thank you for taking the time to read.

r1v1p	-31812	1332059832	offmychest	Man, fuck everything	christ so, after like 3 months of trying to deal with the stress of  seeing my grandmother losing her marbles to Alzheimers, seeing my mom stressed out because of it and from grandma accusing mom of stealing her meds one day, and then doing a complete 180 and saying she never said that (not that I'm blaming grandma, it is what it is and her mind isn't right anymore and there's nothing she can really do about it) and seeing my mother almost have a break down from that, and dealing with after math of some bullshit mini freakout that left me paranoid and semi believin the universe is trying to send me messages about some dumb fucking thing for the preceedin 5 months (thank fuck it seems to be dying down now)My uncle on my mothers side finally rolls into town, so great, I can get out of that house for a while and chill at my old house with my dad, go to my aunts birthday party in some bar in bumblefuck nowhere, have a good time.Except the music is too fucking loud, and my uncles wife who is like twice my fucking age starts almost hitting on me right infront of him, and tellin me how controlling of her he is, and it's like you wan't to say something but the dudes sitting right fucking next to her it's like what do you even do, and she's leanin all over me the whole time she's telling me this shit, like, can't do shit but nodand my jackass father tries to tell me he might not be ok to drive and that I, uninsured, unlicensed, and inexperienced, might have to drive, and thank fuck he was okay to drive by the time we left or I was gonna have to figuratively rip his tits off.we finally get home, and I realize just how fucking depressing it is in this house, and I imagine him sitting alone all day when he's not at work, dining on fucking easy mac and pop tarts and most of the food in the kitchen has probably been in there since mom and I left after christmas, and it's just like god damnit why can't we have a nice family, and when I finally get ready to go to sleep, it turns out one of the cats has been using my former bed as their own personal litterbox and pissing all over the blankets, so I have to sleep in a chair for the night.Fuck that jumble of poorly written words.

u96vp	-31812	1338236831	Toonami	PSA about ratings (or: why you tuning in isn't going to help)	I've been noticing people urging others to tune in/saying they will tune in with the goal of boosting toonamis ratings. Unfortunately, this is not how it works.The ratings in question, the [Nielsen Ratings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_ratings), are extrapolated from a sample group of homes that utilize either viewing diaries or equipment that automatically reports what is being watched and in some cases, who is watching.In essence, if you are not in this sample group, what you're watching has no effect on the ratings.You can however show your support by contacting Adult Swim and letting them know what you think as well as spreading the word via twitter(tweet about it while you're watching, throw in some relevant hash tags(thanks Simie)), facebook, or word of mouth.If anyone has any other idea on how people can show their support I'd be more than happy to edit it into this post
ui5uo	-31812	1338696376	Toonami	Don't just watch; tweet, facebook, talk about it as well.	Word of mouth is your greatest asset.
vpvs0	-31812	1340849085	breakingbad	Hey /r/BreakingBad, guess who I just got off the phone with? Edify and Luis Moncada.	So yeah I messaged Edify on IRC like two nights ago asking him "hey how excited for The Event should I be" and he got back to me the next day and we chatted for a bit.Then he says "wanna talk to Luis Moncada on the phone?", at first I wasn't so sure but he kept pressing and roped me in.And I'm glad he did, it was a short phone call but fun, both Edify and Luis are really chill, told Luis I really enjoyed the work he and his brother did (He mentioned he was rewatching Season 3 like last week and was still a bit flabbergasted by their performance) and I asked him about his eye tattoos and whether he was planning on getting those removed and he talked about how much tattoo removal hurts.So yeah, mad thanks to Edify for being really chill and setting that up and to Luis for being really chill as well and taking time out of his day to have a chat with a fan.Also I've got a feeling The Event is gonna be a lot of fun.

Recently it's become abundantly clear to me that I need to seek help, trouble is I'm not sure where to begin.Should I be trying to get into a psychiatrist? Should I just say that I want to resume treatment? What might I expect?

2kpjwf	-31841	1414613923	relationship_advice	[21/m] Made a mistake I regret which hurt my girlfriend (20/f).	Hello,I'll try to keep this as short as possible but anyway I've been with my girlfriend for around 2 1/2 years. I met her as my friends joined another group of friends whilst I was at university and I got to know her.So anyway yeah around a month ago she got onto my Facebook as I left it on at hers she found that I had searched other girls. Some were girls that I knew from high school that I just wanted to see how they were doing. Another girl was my ex - just to be clear I didn't look because I miss her she was someone I grew up with very young and we was best friends and I've always felt it should have stayed that way it was her birthday and my Mum still speaks to her so I wanted to see how she was doing. I say to myself even if I never met anyone else I wouldn't go back to my ex even if they opportunity was there #1 because I remember how she treated me #2 she has a child with someone else and #3 as I said I felt we should have stayed friends.Finally, in admittance was a girl that I just looked at  because I felt she was attractive (typical man) but it doesn't mean that I would have tried talking to her or betrayed my girlfriend, because she means the absolute world to me, I regret the decision but I can't turn back the clock (if I could I would and not be such an idiot) all I can do is try and show how truly sorry I am.So after finding this she began to think I was looking for other people, that I was bored of her; this I am not. She felt she wasn't good enough and I'm going to want other people and believes I'll just end up cheating on her anyway so why should she be with me? So she got very upset and during this time she has kind of broke off from me and become distant (as I am in my final year of university we would normally only see each other 2/3 times a week) she rarely wants me to come home to see her. Shes asked me not to come and see her without asking as she feels I turn up and act like nothing has happened.Fast-fowarding to today we've still been talking quite alot since then but I say in the title shes my girlfriend but we have been more like friends. She doesn't want to say were in a relationship anymore as she says I've hurt her to much and she feels like she cannot trust me. Although, when we talk we still really get on she always says she wants us to stay as friends. However, I cannot handle the fact of being just friends.I know I've made the mistake and I cannot explain how sorry I am and I really do love her. I spoke to her the other night and I asked her if she felt she needed to stop speaking to me to see how she does really feel about me. As after this fallout we have still spoken and been really close and those two and a half year we became best friends and talked to each other every single day. After around 20 hours she messaged me with random conversation and we began talking again. However, I knew I had to say something and I asked how she feels does she prefer me being there or does she feel like she'd be happier without me. Anyway, here I am now she felt as if it would be better to not talk for longer but she did say she felt it couldn't work again because she wont be able to trust me again.I guess the advice I want is: What do you think the best thing for me to do in the best hope of her maybe wanting me back and realising how truly sorry that I am. Do I leave her alone? (Although I may have to now as shes decided to stop speaking again) or what do I do if she tries to contact me in a couple of days do I ignore it, or what can I say act normal?I know I have to try and accept maybe its over but I find it hard as we do still get on really well apart from when she remembers. I don't want to lose contact with her because I do really care about her.I've also said I dont care how unhappy I am as long as she is happy. As I've made this mistake and I have to think about it for a long time.In this text I can't express how much I know I've hurt her as she does have trust issues due to factors and I also haven't really expressed how sorry I am and that I honestly would never ever cheat on her. In all the relationships I've ever been in I've never cheated and I don't feel like thats the kind of person I am, but I dont think I can get her to realise that.
2l5oan	-31841	1415023753	relationship_advice	[21/M] Recently split up with gf [20/F] struggling to cope with it during my final year of university.	Hello, I posted recently about I had a fall out with my girlfriend and she no longer trusts me we've been together for 3 years. I have never cheated and I do feel like I have always done my best to make her happy. I have made some mistakes along the way some which I regret and I have always been so sorry about and never made the same mistake twice. She still fails to trust me but I do understand as she has trust issues and it was my fault when she decided to end-it.Anyway we broke up about a month ago. We still talked because I do still care about her and she still enjoyed talking to me. However, it felt weird after a while because I just wanted her back so I felt as if time apart would help. She messaged me after around 24 hours and we started talking again just chatting but then again I just asked is she ready to start from the beginning? She said no, she felt she hadn't had time apart for long enough and wasn't sure if she still wanted me anymore.After not speaking for another day. A whole bunch of stuff happens and basically I feel like shes maybe started seeing someone else or talking to them. We speak again just to see if shes okay as she messaged me saying she felt unwell; I confront her to ask if she kissed a boy I knew came out with her on Halloween and she said they were playing games with friends and they had to blow stuff in each others mouths so technically she did. I'm pretty heartbroken by this and decide after discussion its definitely it and I know she has probably done with me.I'm just finding it hard to cope. I'm final year pharmacy student and I'm struggling to concentrate, don't find things enjoyable and I find myself sitting there looking on Facebook, twitter and snapchat etc. to see what shes up to; or looking at pictures of her and us. I know its pathetic but she really does mean alot to me I'll always care about her I just don't know what to do. I can't come to terms with the fact its over and always have that little bit of hope when I wake up she would have text me. I just need some advice on what to do. Should I delete all my social media for a while whilst I get over her? I know I should spend more time with friends but they can be busy and I live quite far away from my friends at home. Also, Ive not got alot of money at the moment to travel around.tldr: Broke up with my girlfriend and I am finding it difficult to concentrate on my studies and I'm really struggling with coming to terms with the break-up.
2lf8dp	-31841	1415233099	ExNoContact	Started no-contact with my recent ex-girlfriend of 3 years. Finding it hard hopefully I'll get there!	So my girlfriend [F/20] broke up with me [M/21] around a month ago we continued to talk for this month. The time that she broke up with me was my fault and I have shown her how sorry I am. I haven't been unfaithful or harmed her, I just made a silly mistake. However, recently decided its best we stopped talking.We tried this no contact a few times the first 2 times she text me asking am I okay and we began to talk again but she was happy of the idea of remaining friends (as we were also best friends during our relationship and have helped each other through alot) at the time I couldn't cope with this idea; because she means so much to me. So I decided we needed some time apart to see what she wanted. I wasn't very good at no contact so I see her out and talk to her. Shes quite annoyed and so I leave straight away but she does tell me she feels as if we are done now because shes lost her trust in me.After a couple of days she texts me asking if I have been talking to my ex- (of over 5 years ago) I said no, which I haven't because I wouldn't want to. Then I ask her has she moved on and she said "I've not moved on, I just dont want you". Then for some strange reason we start talking normal again like everything is really great and were getting along; the morning after she doesn't respond so resume no contact.So here I am now after 2 days of no contact I'm finding it hard. I made the decision to remove her off all social media. I still have her number because I know it from memory anyway. I am finding it hard but try to keep myself busy. I'm in my final year of pharmacy. I am struggling to concentrate as shes on my mind all the time, however, hoping I can resolve this soon. I lost quite a few friends whilst I was with her but they have spoken to me but they live far away from me since I'm at university so I cant see them often.I know I have to tell myself its over - because it is my fault. From this post you don't really see that we was really close and had been through alot and we was really happy before all this happened so it was confusing but I understand she has trust issues as I said earlier.The advice I want is how can I stop holding on and wanting to wake up and see a text from her?How do I keep my concentration up and take my mind off her?Is there going to be a length time where I can maybe talk to her again? Or would I be expected to leave it forever, if she never speaks to me again?Any extra advice?**tl;dr:** Decided to start no contact with my ex- we was very close but I made a mistake and she has always struggled to trust me even though I've never been unfaithful. I'm finding it hard and wondered if anyone had any advice. Also, would there ever be a length time I could contact her again?
2ll3jh	-31841	1415374294	ExNoContact	Three days NC; after one month break-up.	I really don't think I can cope with this anymore. I've posted previously we was together 3 years and she has decided to end it a month ago, as she felt she couldn't trust me and I wanted someone else. Which I can assure you I did not and I've always been faithful.Three days NC and I've never felt so much pain. I'm upset all the time; things that I used to enjoy just dont excite me anymore. I've lost the person that meant everything to me and we would talk to each other every single day. She was my best friend aswell and just thinking about what I have lost makes me so sad.I've decided to book an appointment with the university for counselling. The appointment isn't till the 21st which is so far away. Hopefully I can attend certain drop-in sessions which are first-come-first-serve. The reason I felt I had to do this is because I'm final year doing pharmacy so of course I can't let my grades slip and also I have to prepare for any life occurrences like this in the future.I've always considered myself quite strong. I've been through a break-up with who was my best-friend for 16years (one year relationship) and this didn't hurt as much as this does now. Maybe its because I've gotten older and really wanted to settle down after my degree. I really thought she was the one for me.She meant the world to me and I didn't show it; we did love each other deeply and had been very close and now its all gone. When she first ended it I feel I begged too much and probably looked desperate. I'm also fairly certain she has begun talking to someone else now, so I'm a mess.I just want to talk to her but I know I can't. Shes always been there and now she isn't so I feel empty inside. I can't imagine it getting better for a long-long time.
2lrtt2	-31841	1415551975	ExNoContact	Well... I gave in.	Was finding it very hard was on 5 days NC which is the longest time we haven't spoken for. Someone who was my best friend and closest person to me for so long had gone out of my life.I noticed she started deleting tweets we had too each other so this upset me. I resisted contacting her at this point. I then decided that I had so many photos of us on my phone I had to sort through them and delete some. This took a long time and at the end I just caved in; I couldn't not speak to her any longer and I just wanted to know if she was okay.I said "I know I'm stupid for doing this. How are you and [her kitten] and [her family]". I mentioned the kitten as she recently bought it before we broke up and I never liked kittens/cats but it really grew on me, I also missed him.- I just needed to know how she was.Anyway she replied saying "Fine". I responded "Good, sorry for contacting you." Which I'm not sure if I should have apologised.Anyway, my friends said I've been a bit silly and should have stayed strong. I just needed to speak to her I mostly wanted to know if she was okay.The time which we broke up was my fault. It was a silly mistake which caused her to not trust me; I regret it very much and I am deeply sorry for it. I don't know if anyone else is doing NC for a mistake they've made but I feel now I know I probably wont get her back. No matter how many good times we've had together.
2mkvnh	-31841	1416247594	ExNoContact	I feel like I get somewhere... Then my head just doesn't let me.	We broke up 2 months ago. Stopped speaking properly around the 31st October. I ended up giving up and texted her a week ago. I just had some stuff to tell her but she was very cold so that hurt but also gave me a sense of - right I must move on at the time I thought I could do it really easily. How wrong was I?So after this happened I decided that I had to block her on social media; as it was hurting too much. So I did this and then I noticed that she had deleted every single memory that we ever had: tweets to each other, pictures together and moments etc. Anyway this hurt like a tonne of bricks. We was together for 3 years and I don't feel like I could erase her like that.I decided to go out with friends this weekend and at times I felt miserable. We was having a good time as there was alot of us but there was times I'd just think about her. I felt as if sometimes someone speaking to me might've thought I was miserable. Anyway, one of my ex's old bestfriends (of around 18years) was out and they fell out during my relationship with her. We talked and my ex- did the same to her she deleted every picture they had together, tweets and facebook etc.I suppose that's just her way of dealing with it, it still hurts like hell. Her old best friend wanted asked me if she should message my ex- to check if she was okay after discussion I said yes, only if you want to though not because you feel like you have to. Anyway, she was fine and that made me happy inside; because I genuinely care about her. Thats what hurts; I'm pretty certain shes seeing someone else and I know she is fine (and probably happy) - don't get me wrong deep down I am happy that shes happy as I know loving and caring about someone doesn't always mean being together. I just hate the fact that I'm miserable and I can't imagine the thought of being with anyone else; I can't concentrate for very long and I'm in the middle of writing my dissertation; it upsets me that it comes across that she doesn't want to see if I'm okay anymore.Theres times when I feel strong then I just go straight back to the beginning. Like I came home today and went on Facebook and noticed she unblocked me as her likes were back on my pictures. It was just upsetting and confuses me as to why shes decided to unblock me. Anyway, we're not friends on Facebook and as much as I would like to contact her I can't for a long long time. Honestly, I do want to salvage a friendship one day as I care about her deeply. Whether thats true in however much time is the question. 
2n478q	-31841	1416696012	ExNoContact	It really is more difficult than I ever imagined.	I've always seen myself as quite a straight-thinking person and good at decision making. I've never had my emotions truly overcome me before and I've had a break-up before with someone I knew for 16years and it wasn't like this.It really is affecting me alot how much I think about her, I have removed her from social media but I still look and I just dont feel I have the willpower not to. I always think about the mistakes I made and the things that I could have done differently; I've reflected on them alot. I can't deal with the fact that I get the impression that she dislikes me as we was so close for so long. Finally, I just cant understand how shes removed every single memory (before I blocked her) everything it just makes me feel like I meant nothing.I was with her for 3 years and ended it 2 months ago but I feel I'm improving very slowly. I have decided to undergo counselling. My first session went well but we've not gone into a way to deal with it yet.I just feel really weak. These feelings are consuming alot of my time in my day. Luckily I'm a student at the moment and I have had to get some extensions on my work. I just fear when I hit the real-world as a pharmacist I can't afford to let this happen again as I'd be in a more critical position that deals with the care of others.
2nmxzy	-31841	1417147157	ExNoContact	Another knockback... Probably going to be really hard if it happens.	To begin I'll talk about the backstory I suppose it hurts to think about it.Around this time last year my ex- broke up with me again because she found it hard I was kind of long-distance at university. I never really understood why but I was in pieces.Anyway I remember my flat mate helped me through it and suggested she may have met someone else. I swore to him and myself she would never ever do that to me, she just wouldn't.Turns out I was wrong. Her brother told me she started seeing a new guy when I went out a couple of days after this. She had been round his, gone to the cinema. My whole world turned upside down and I had to message her and ask why the hell she didn't tell me.Anyway, after the night out she asks me to go round here and we talk. I'm in pieces pretty much she tells me all they did was kiss anyway I don't really want to go into detail because it destroyed me.I decide to forgive her because I love her so much and she made the point it wasn't cheating as we wasn't together... I know I'm a mug for that. It took me a couple of months to get over it. However, I know he always tried to message her. I trusted her though because we did get close again. Anyway. I decide to look on Twitter and out of curiosity I remember all this and see that yesterday he has tried to speaking to her again.This is like twisting the knife anyone but him. Seriously anyone. I shouldn't care but I know for a fact he will treat her badly; not that I'm the person who will do it right. I can't even put into words what I am feeling right now. 
2nykqv	-31841	1417457375	ExNoContact	21 days... It doesn't seem to get easier for me.	I seem to be getting worse day by day and its really draining my energy. I feel like I'm surrounded by memories no matter where I go, at home or the city I'm in at university and its really overcoming me now. I just feel like I lost the best thing that I ever had, something that made me truly happy. I'm not expecting for her to run back into my arms anymore but I know I really need her right now, as a friend. Just to talk to. I know I cant though I'm too scared of being turned away as I know shes moved on and she probably doesn't want to speak to me. I just wish she knew how I felt and how much I need her I have my friends and family around me but I just can't shake these feelings I've let them consume me.I honestly do feel as if I could slowly be hitting depression. Its been nearly 3 months and now I'm at a standstill where I really have to try and be happy and the things I used to find enjoyable aren't there. I struggle to get out of the bed most mornings.I feel really really stupid sometimes. People out there deal with worse but this has really beaten me. It hurts to lose someone you truly love.
2oi6px	-31841	1417911111	ExNoContact	Urgh...	Well I just had a look at her instagram and literally 5minutes before she posted a picture saying "When you see your ex drowning at the beach" and its basically a picture underneath showing someone who doesn't care.I don't really understand. I never did anything horrible to her. I was always there for her. I made a few mistakes at the end which weren't something worthy of a hatred towards me as I'd forgiven her for much worse (not that its a competition).I don't really want to overthink it. If its because she knows I can look as shes not made the profile private. Whether she wants to hurt me; wants a reaction from me.I was actually getting somewhere. Well I was still quite unhappy each day until later in the day but this has knocked me right back. It has really upset me so she wins.
2ot8m1	-31841	1418171173	ExNoContact	I'm 21 nearly 22...	I have posted alot probably every few days I just feel like typing something. Its starting to become a rollercoaster for me. I had another meeting with my counsellor and this was supposed to be my first and last session until after xmas however, she feared that I was becoming depressed and asked if I would have another appointment next week. As she would like to keep an eye on me.I agreed as it does help to talk about it all to someone and have an outsider judge the problems in the relationship. I know all the problems but it doesn't change my feelings. Also the constant blame I have on myself doesn't help. It was my third session but the first session where I actually spoke about it all for an hour and it did help however, I feel as if I go back into a slump everytime.She has suggested that maybe I look at continuing counselling for however long whilst maybe starting anti-depressants in January so that I am able to finish my degree (~6months). As a pharmacy student I know the downsides to this as there is a chance it can make me worse and coming off them may make things worse.The reason I mentioned age in the title is because I know I'm young and I've let my emotions just completely overpower me and affect too many aspects of my life.
2rs0vd	-31841	1420748289	ExNoContact	Not been here in a while. Strangest month and not really sure how I feel about it all.	Well I'll start by saying no contact isn't 59 days and I'll reset it when I get the chance too. Its been a long time since me and my ex- split up so I'm not sure if I'll follow the counter as I don't want to count the days anymore I just want this feeling of missing her all the time to be gone. I'm sure it will as I'll explain that maybe I've done everything I can. This post may be quite long as I just want to be able to write everything down.I suppose I'll start where this crazy month began. On my birthday 19th December. I went out with friends to pubs and then I decided I wanted to go where to clubs are (however my friends decided against this as the clubs are near to where my ex- lives and where she goes with her friends) anyway as I was drunk and I remember being upset because I still missed her; I went on my own. The first place that I went into she was there it was quite awkward because for a start I was on my own so I felt like a loser but I knew I'd see someone else I know there and then because I hadn't seen her in around a month. Anyway, I decided to say hello and she said hello back and we talked for a little while and I decided to go home. I get a taxi and she messages me asking me to go to hers. I ask why? She says that she wants to talk and being me I decide to go and stay the night. In the morning she is still quite drunk and shes nice and then I can just feel that as soon as the day goes on and she asks me to leave its going to be back to square one. She can't really remember the things we talked about - which were just basically about everything that happened and that she does still love and care about me. She asks me to leave and I say before I leave that I don't want to be a mistake and she says that I am not and we don't talk for a few days. During those few days I feel as if she used me for sex as she had been with someone else but I remember her telling me how awful he was and how badly he treated her even when they were not together and thinking about stuff like that makes you piece together. Also, things she said like she missed me and she missed the sex. Sorry for the details. I decide that I need to know if I was a mistake and if she just messaged me because she wanted me for sex. She said she didn't use me for sex and I wasn't a mistake however, as she was drunk the things she said she didn't mean and she feels like we should stop speaking again.The 23rd December I have a present for her kitten that she bought whilst she was with me and something for herself. I make a pretty silly decision to ask should I post it through her letterbox or can I meet her and give it to her. I meet up with her and we go out for a bit then she invites me back to hers so she can open them and to talk for a little. She opens them and then shes just smiling as she is happy with what I got her and we kiss and I stay for a few hours and get a taxi early in the morning. After this we continue to talk over Christmas however, I wake up and I received a text early Christmas morning saying something like "I know your talking to _______ so I don't think we can speak anymore." So I'm confused by this as I'm not talking to anyone and I didn't understand why she was so bothered as she didn't really seem interested. So I tell her I'm not and she tells me not to speak to her if I'm talking to someone else. Over this time period she asks me to delete her number and I do so. I then ask her to block me on Facebook and other stuff because I do struggle not to contact her. (I lasted over 30days last time but I gave in)On New Years Eve/Day she emails me wishing me a Happy New Year and if I was out. - which confuses me as we said don't talk. I wish her happy new year back and that I was asleep at the time and ask what she got up to. She replied once and then decided to ignore the message after that. I ask her why email me and she just said "She only wished me happy new year" and had a bit of a moan.So once again I think that it must be over now but on the 2nd January she texts me asking what I'm doing and as I was revising for an exam I just tell her I'm reading about the topic. Then she makes some small-talk and I just reply with a smiley face and about 20minutes later she asks do I want to go round to hers. I ask her is she sure and say that I do because I enjoy spending time with her and more than anything I want us to get on. So we chill out at hers and watch a film and order food. I get the bus back late at night.On the 3rd she messages me telling me that I cheated on her when I was with her and I'm still not telling her. She tells me that loads of girls are interested in me and I've been wanting to sleep with them for a long time - I wish I had girls interested in me! That I must be speaking to other girls because I've been online on whatsapp but I was talking about my exam with my friend from university. She tells me that she was going to forgive me and be my friend but she wont now because according to her I am talking to someone else.I can tell anyone reading this now that I never cheated on her and I love her to pieces and that I've not even talked to someone else like that since me and her split up.On the fourth she replies to my messages from the morning before however we just start talking about random stuff and that she has work. I felt like I had nothing to lose so I asked her what she was doing after work and she says nothing why? So I ask if she wants to do something like go to the cinema or go for something to eat. She says that theres nothing good at the cinema and she has eaten so says I can go to hers. Anyway, I go quite late at about 10PM as that is when she got home and we put something on the laptop watch it and she cuddles up to me and holds my hand and all the time I just think "what have I lost?" it still felt comfortable and right even after this time. She turns round and tells me that she still likes me and I say I still like her too; although I love her. I tell her that I hope we can keep speaking to each other as friends as I don't want to fall out anymore and that after university maybe we could see how things go. I leave at around 2AM as I have an exam in the morning.So the last time I saw her was on Monday. I message her asking what shes up to and I'm coming home from university so does she want to do anything and I say I know I'm pushing it. She says I can go round to hers later on and so I go. Once again she cuddles me and stuff and everything feels okay. I never begged her to get back with me or anything I just wanted to spend time with her as it made me happy; it stopped this pain thats always there when shes not. We order food and we fall asleep together. In the middle of the night she randomly asks me to turn her light on and wakes me up as I was confused I didn't do it so she felt like I was in a mood with her... I was just confused why she asked me randomly to do it. Anyway, she did it herself and she just wanted to put more layers on. Part of me didn't want to get up aswell as I felt like she was going to kick me out.In the afternoon she asks what I'm up to today so I kind of get thats a hint for me to leave. So I leave and go back home. I decide not to speak to her for the rest of that day because I got the impression she didn't want me to be there. The next day I decide to message her to see how she is and well... I'm blocked.I ask her why she has blocked me and she tells me that I overstayed my welcome by sleeping over. However, I literally just fell asleep because I was tired as the previous nights I had left when I could tell she wanted me too. There was a part of me that wanted me to stay obviously but I wouldn't force her to let me stay. She also had the cheek to say that I didn't message her the day after I stayed over as all I wanted was sex. Which I find is just so untrue its unreal the reason I spend time with her is because I love to do so, she is still one of the only people that makes me truly happy. Also, as I said previously she mentioned how much she missed the sex not me. Yes, there were times where I started it but I didn't force her to. Then the killer thing was that she realised if she carried on speaking to me. She wouldn't be able to start talking or seeing anyone else. The reason that this hurt is because I mentioned this on one of the nights I went to hers and I asked her if she wanted to stop speaking do it now. She said she wanted to carry on talking as we do get on and now she has done this. She literally just cut me out of her life again with no thought about me.So as of now. We haven't spoken since yesterday. She blocked me on everything I asked her to as I can't put myself in this position again. No matter how much I love her I can't do this to myself, she makes me so happy but then she can make me the unhappiest person too by just pushing me away. It was all a bit sudden as those nights that I spent with her at hers I can't really capture with words but we got on and she was really close with me. Then she just suddenly changes the other way.As much as I want her to I hope she doesn't contact me again - unless she seriously wants to try again but I know I shouldn't want that. She truly has messed me around this time.Sorry its so long I just needed to write it out. I don't know if I regret it. I don't think I do... She makes me really happy but I've seen how she can literally rip my heart out. This time I did nothing wrong I was nice and she just cut me off. I know I've put myself in this position and I do feel like its back to square one.**tl;dr** Me and my ex- started talking again for the past month there were moments in this time that we got really close and had a really good time together. However, she still accused me of things that I didn't do at times. I let myself believe we could continue talking because we was really getting on until yesterday she decided to cut me off again. I feel like I have to start again now and I am scared of she contacts me again as she makes me really happy and I always want to spend time with her however, I know deep down she will cut me off unless she is serious about trying again.
2s6h94	-31841	1421081740	ExNoContact	My experience of breaking NC.	I wrote a very long post a few days ago just so I could vent. I would just like to write another post just so I can share my experience of breaking no contact and that I remember what can happen if I do again.From my previous post put short I bumped into my ex- on a night out, went home and she contacted me from then on we began talking again on and off. One day she would decide she didn't really want to then she would until eventually I truly believed she wanted to continue talking.The reason that I broke contact was for several reasons: No matter how much I try to deny it I'm always going to love her because she makes me truly happy and I love spending time with her. I can even clearly see how some of the things she has done are very sly and hurtful towards me however it always seems that when we do actually spend time together we got on really really well and that always seems worth so much more - which is a very hard mindset to leave. I told one of my close friends that we had started speaking again and she told me that she is more than likely using me because of either a) she feels lonely and bored b) she may feel that I am slowly moving on or c) she knows that I'll come running whenever she wants me. At the time that my friend told me this I felt I could handle it because I got a little boost and I was happy again. I'd sat an exam a few days earlier aswell and I did really really well so I felt that spending 3 nights with my ex- was worth it as it set my mind straight and let me actually focus which I haven't been able to do in months.I look back to when I said that I can handle it and feel like I was so smug that I didn't really know what was coming. Turns out my ex- did want to stop speaking again and proceeded to block me (some of which I asked her to block me on). As a promise to myself before she blocked me I said to her that no matter how much I love her I can't do it anymore, I can't keep running back unless we actually try to work things out. Here I am now around 4 days NC I think? It does feel like I've had to start again. Although this time I know I didn't do anything wrong during the time we was speaking again I know that I was really nice to her and we both got on. The reason that I am glad that I broke NC is because I got questions that I wanted answered and found that she doesn't hate me. If I had the strength I wouldn't break it again because I know she would probably break my heart... again. I'm just hoping she doesn't try to message me because it is very hard to overcome that feeling and I'd find it very hard to ignore her.I do have some things that I need to overcome such as looking at her profiles as I know that makes me desire her more and gaining my focus back. I can honestly say that I'm better than when we first broke up (September) but some things are hard to overcome. In summary, breaking no contact can have its upsides in certain aspects for some situations. However, if you truly want to make progress and move on then stick to it. If I was asked do I regret it... Honestly I don't think I do. 
2w0qrw	-31841	1424043825	ExNoContact	Been nearly 5 months since we split up. I'm alot better than I was and I really want to be happy. Its still hard and I'm not completely ready to move on.	Me and my ex- had a very close relationship and I care about her greatly still (I'm sure alot of you have similar stories). A lot has happened which is all in my post history but its quite long. I finally have a part of me that actually realises there will be no reconciliation which has taken me this long. I still find some days hard but its also increased my ambition in other aspects of my life e.g. after my pharmacy degree I want to move onto medicine which is a possibility for me.I saw she unblocked me on Facebook obviously I wondered why and with it being her 21st Birthday and Valentines this weekend its been hard.Anyone reading this I'd like to say that talking to people about it really does help. I don't like to feel like a burden to my friends and talk about it all the time (even 5 months on) but some of them genuinely will want to help and will understand whether they've been through it themselves or not. I also seeked counselling as I was in a really bad place and I probably experienced depression - I'm still in counselling but made the decision to cut down the sessions; its been hard but I wanted to see if I could cope whilst still having the option to talk to my counsellor as she really does help.Anyway when I wrote this message and maybe one day when I'm ready I can send it. Maybe not. Alot can change in months.&gt;*Happy belated 21st Birthday. I hope it was a super amazing fantastic day and your party was/is as I remember you was organising one.*&gt;*I saw I was unblocked and I felt it would be wrong if I didn't say anything - no matter how you feel about me. Obviously I'll make this short and this isn't an attempt to become friends as a little part of me FINALLY knows thats probably never going to happen.*&gt;*To add - I'd like you to know this. You will always be a big part of my life, I look back and don't regret many things, every single memory we shared makes me smile. It also shaped us into the people that we are and will be in the future. Obviously I regret that I ever hurt you and I truly regret that I always did and its something that I've reflected on alot.*&gt;*I just hope we can both move on and be happy. I think we both deserve it as once upon a time we both cared about each other more than anything in the world. There will always be a little piece of me that hopes you're OK!*&gt;*Well... I know you'll probably be angry I've messaged and I'll probably spiral back into... whatever I was in. You know I can be an idiot so forgive me. Its probably best you don't reply and I will do you a favour and not do this again.*

21bz8l	-31854	1395764868	trees	I need to educate myself and my wife about marijuana. Where do I start? (serious)	I am someone who is taking a pro-legalization stance on marijuana. I am not totally informed as to why, but that's the way I am leaning.My wife still believes it will kill brain cells. I'd like to get her truly informed.The problem is that I can't seem to find some straight forward, reputable links that spell out the positives of marijuana legalization and the reasons recreational uses should be legal. I'd like to find links that are reputable, that are not something where someone is clearly from a "pro weed" stance with pot leaves everywhere, and things that have proof. My goal is to walk away with concise, clear, "talk to me like I'm 5" reading material for my wife and myself that will make us both understand why we should take a pro-marijuana stance. Now, in all honesty, part of this is because I'd like her to green light me to use it if it gets legalized. She's against it. But I do want the truth.Could someone point me in the right direction please? I really want some concise, clear and straight-forward truth sites that are easily shown to be the right kind of thing for her to learn. Mayo clinic rather than "jojo's ganja king" site things.Thank youOldeDude

I am author Brian Staveley - AMA	Hi /r/Fantasy ![I am Brian Staveley.]( http://bstaveley.wordpress.com/about/)  [*The Emperor’s Blades* is my first book]( http://bstaveley.wordpress.com/the-series/), the opening volume of an epic fantasy series, released from Tor exactly one week ago. Which means that I alternate between celebration and an overwhelming urge to hide in an internetless corner of the world until about 2020. The book follows three adult children of a murdered emperor – a monk, a politician, and an elite soldier – as they attempt to complete their own training, ferret out the plot that killed their father, and stay alive in the process. The book took me seven years to write, the first of which I spent in Asia, where I alternated between reading, writing, and running away from the local dogs during my afternoon workouts. For most people, a year would be plenty of time to write a novel, but I needed six more. During that time I taught high school – English, history, religion, philosophy – scribbling furiously in the summers. Fortunately, the second volume, *The Providence of Fire*, is in the final drafts now, and will be released in January, 2015.When I’m not putting my characters through the wringer, I spend time sledding with my twenty-month-old son, talking books with my wife, burning things in the fire pit with my friends, and training for adventure racing, a wonderful sport that involves much dehydration, hypothermia, sleep deprivation, and, sometimes, trackless bogs.I’ll be logging in at **6:30 PM (Eastern Standard Time)** and answering questions until I run out of beer. Come on by!Best,Brian********************************************EDITLooks like things are slowing dow, so I'm going to sign off. Thanks so much to everyone for showing up! This was great fun. If there are any late questions, I'll try to take a look at them tomorrow and post answers. And now, it's time for a Switchback Porter!
308xq1	-31855	1427288757	Fantasy	Sticking the Landing: What Does it Take to Finish a Series Well?	I wanted to tap the considerable brain trust of r/fantasy on the subject of conclusions. While I've read plenty of engrossing series openers, I find it's much harder to come up with a satisfying conclusion to a fantasy trilogy (or longer series). I'm curious A) What endings have you all found satisfying or frustrating and B) WHY? What specific elements worked or failed?(And no, there's absolutely no connection between these questions and the fact that I'm revising the final volume of the Unhewn Throne series as we speak...)
30sz2a	-31855	1427722473	Fantasy	Readers and Writers: Is the Internet Breaking Your Brain?	Ok, so the title might have been a little hyperbolic, but I'm very curious if others have experienced some of the same things I have. Over the last four or five years (since I got a smartphone, really), I've noticed myself having a harder time concentrating deeply and fully for long periods of time. On the reading front, I used to be able to read for 16 hours at a stretch, no problem. Now, even when I'm really enjoying a book, I feel the need to take a break every hour or two. More than that, it takes me about fifteen minutes to really get into most books -- I need to consciously switch gears, to quit skimming down the page, and to take the time to immerse myself in the fictive world. I don't remember ever having a transitional period like that back in my teens and twenties.When it comes to writing, I find it takes me longer to sink fully into a scene and it's easier, now, for me to pop out of it. I've linked both of these experiences to my dramatically increasing use of the internet, social media, etc. I notice that now, whenever I have a free moment, I'm reaching for my phone or computer. My old ability to sit and stare out the window (or at a blank page) for hours seems to have vanished. So I'm curious: A) Who else is experiencing this (or something like it?) and B) What do you do about it? How do you fight back? And I suppose there's another question, too: C) Do you think my diagnosis is right? Are all the hours on-line to blame?
30xn9w	-31855	1427815407	Fantasy	Hi Reddit - I'm epic fantasy novelist Brian Staveley. AMA!	[I am author Brian Staveley](https://bstaveley.wordpress.com/about/) and I have to open with an apology. You folks were kind enough to vote me the 2014 "Best Debut" Stabby for [*THE EMPEROR'S BLADES*](https://bstaveley.wordpress.com/the-series/)... and I haven't posted a single photo. Churlish, very churlish. I'll make it up to you tonight in fine fashion: if there's something you want to see stabbed with a 12-inch dagger, let me know, and I'll do my best to impale it.I'm also happy to answer questions about my second book, [*THE PROVIDENCE OF FIRE](https://bstaveley.wordpress.com/the-providence-of-fire/), or even my untitled third book, although those answers will probably be misrepresentations or outright lies.When I'm not writing, I split my time between sledding (there are some great, long woods runs around here), wrangling my 3-year-old son (who is a fan of said woods runs), adventure racing, wrestling the neighbor's goat, and moving firewood from one place to another. This winter I supplemented these activities with a lot of time chipping ice off the roof.**Thanks for all the questions everyone! I've got to hit the hay now, but feel free to add more questions. I'll be back tomorrow to respond to any stragglers...**Also, here are some shots of the weapon:http://imgur.com/XkifzeW,rYiMzsj,2okfzJX#1http://imgur.com/XkifzeW,rYiMzsj,2okfzJX#2
31vpu9	-31855	1428505723	Fantasy	On the Opening of Novels: Drowning Rats or Missing Prisoners? Have Your Say.	Hi folks. I ended up in an interesting discussion recently, about the openings of books, and I wanted to follow it up with a little research. Below are two potential openings to two different novels. (These aren't real books -- I whipped them up just now.)  Which one would you be more likely to read, and why? I'll share results and some explanation of what I'm trying to assess once the answers are in. Thanks!SELECTION A:It should not have been possible. The cell's steel door weighed two ton, and hung from hinges thick as a man's arm. Four guards stood at that door day and night, hardened soldiers culled from the most brutal campaigns and armed with the most horrible warded weapons. The queen had given them a single order: KEEP THAT DOOR CLOSED. And yet somehow, the prisoner had escaped.SELECTION B:"I'll tell you something..." Jessa began."I don't want you to tell me something," Rolt replied, prodding with his stick at a sleek black shape thrashing in the bucket between his legs. "I'm trying to drown this poor rat.""That's what I'm trying to tell you," Jessa said. For the better part of an hour now, she'd been hanging upside down from her knees, dangling from the oak's broad branch, talking mostly, occasionally nocking an arrow to her bow to shoot at a rotten apple fifty paces distant. "It'd be a lot easier to stab it, or wring its neck.""I don't want to stab it or wring its neck," Rolt replied morosely. "I read somewhere that drowning's a good way to go. Supposed to be just like falling asleep." He began crooning an off-key lullaby as he prodded at the rat again.
320676	-31855	1428591659	Fantasy	What Does it All Mean? An Analysis of Openings	First off, thanks to everyone who participated in my utterly unscientific and statistically bankrupt poll yesterday. As promised, a little explanation and back story:A few days back, Victoria Schwab (author of VICIOUS and A DARKER SHADE OF MAGIC) and I were having a twitter discussion about which aspect of a novel is more crucial when it comes to pulling in readers: character or plot. So I tried to whip up two samples (I've copied them below, for those who missed all this the first time around). The first sample is all plot and no character. The second, all character, no plot.THE RESULTS: Thirty-five people voted, and the voting was pretty close: 20 people preferred Sample B (character-driven) and 15 preferred Sample A (plot-driven). All of which just goes to show, I guess, something we've known all along: different folks like different stuff. That said, many readers said they were interested in *both* samples, and would read on, and a number of readers pointed out that the best opening would involve a mixture of the two, a sentiment with which I wholeheartedly agree. So, nothing really groundbreaking here, but it was fun to see how people approached this. And now I feel like I need to write a damn book about Rolt and Jessa...Thanks again!THE SAMPLES:SELECTION A: It should not have been possible. The cell's steel door weighed two ton, and hung from hinges thick as a man's arm. Four guards stood at that door day and night, hardened soldiers culled from the most brutal campaigns and armed with the most horrible warded weapons. The queen had given them a single order: KEEP THAT DOOR CLOSED. And yet somehow, the prisoner had escaped.SELECTION B: "I'll tell you something..." Jessa began.

Programming was well-organized and interesting, but it left me with a basic question, which I will pose to the con-goers among you:When you go to a panel, specifically a writing-based panel, very specifically, a panel on something to do with fantasy, what are you looking for from the experience?

Team Reddit -- eager to pick your brains on this one:I've just finished the last book in my Unhewn Throne trilogy and it weighs in at about 290K words. As I work through the edits, I'm starting on the next project, and I thought it would be interesting to write a shorter standalone, something about 110K. My two part question is:1. Do fantasy readers WANT shorter books (not as a matter of universal principle, but from time to time)?2. What short fantasy books have you enjoyed, admired?Thanks!

It's a single shot close-up, of the rapper. It fades into and out of focus, as if behind smoked glass, and when the bass hits, "pixel noise" jumps in. The most important part is that as he raps, graphics representing the words fly from his mouth (sometimes literal, sometimes metaphorical). I also remember it was a collaboration (so feat. should be in the title) and one of the parties had 'mind' in their name.

I just met Shaun Thompson, the South African legend who broke down the door of the North Shore with Rabbit and Richards for the eventual OZ and US invasion.  I got to talk with him about the Pipe Masters and how certain guys have the focus (Kelly, Mick, Joel) and others do not (JohnJohn, Yadin, Wilko).  He also broke down Pipeline and told me about all the technical difficulties of the wave and the sections.  IT WAS AWESOME!  Anyone ever met a pro surfer?  Have a good story to tell?  Did you get drunk together?  Did he steal your girl or give you the cold shoulder?

(Very new to this)	So I am planning on building my first PC because my tech-savvy friends tell me it is cheaper and better to do so. I'm a little at a loss but hopeful. I want a computer than can run games like TF2, Battlefield 3, Just Cause 2, etc (modern games) at a good framerate. I dont really care about having all the settings on high. I have a list of parts but I would like feedback, especially about the motherboard and the power supply. Everything else seems good I think. I have a small budget, but I'm saving up.

I've heard that you can ground yourself by touching the case, the PSU plugged in, or the PSU NOT plugged in. Which of these is right, if any?How do I manage cables? So far all I know is try to keep all excess wire in the space behind the mobo and use zipties. What do zipties do? Thanks! Man I've been lurking in this subreddit for...about 10 months now. Finally going to build my own PC :DIt's been one hell of a journey haha

My problem is that when I connect both the HDD and the SSD to the PC windows asks for the installation software. I think it looks for the files in the HDD, not the SSD. I disconnected the HDD when installing win7 to the SSD. How do I get the computer to load Win7 off the SSD?Also, is molex supposed to be hard as hell to connect? I have case fans attached to a molex power connector but, despite a lot of pushing, the connection is very flimsy. Once again, thanks!

2pibmg	-31890	1418765141	FifaCareers	[Rant] Player career and international tournaments	Once upon a time, there was a 80 rated striker from Germany whose biggest dream was to play his heart out for his country at a major tournament. He was happy about his first call up to play a friendly. And his second one. The 15/16 season was about to end and he was very cautious not to get injured, hoping he'd get a call up for the Euros. The season ended and after waiting a few weeks that felt like an eternity, he got a [message from his club trainer](http://i.imgur.com/CahDIg2.jpg) saying that he was leaving for national duty. He saw his name on the [list of players nominated](http://i.imgur.com/MKYvbzy.jpg) released in a press release. He was so close to fulfilling one of his biggest dreams and packed his stuff looking forward to representing his country at a major tournament and waiting for his [first match](http://i.imgur.com/m2dFwhm.jpg) to play.But arriving at the trainign camp came the shock: nobody recognized that he was there. Nobody talked to him. He was invisible. His teammates played the games completely ignoring his existence. [It was like he wasn't there.](http://i.imgur.com/fe9SbBc.jpg) So there wasn't a single match between the end of the season and the first friendly he could play.Obviously bummed, he returned to his club and had a look at his calender for the season. "What the hell is going on?" he mumbled into his beard. He checked [September](http://i.imgur.com/SrLKgKU.jpg), [October](http://i.imgur.com/yfyRk2P.jpg), [November](http://i.imgur.com/AcFtOf8.jpg), [December](http://i.imgur.com/MPdRB2t.jpg), [January](http://i.imgur.com/eIgmsLz.jpg), [February](http://i.imgur.com/14u6vBK.jpg), [March](http://i.imgur.com/X7AJA25.jpg), [April](http://i.imgur.com/k9sWR2h.jpg) and [May](http://i.imgur.com/DkCUEbc.jpg). There wasn't a single international match. Confused and devastated, he built a time machine, hoping that it would fix his problem but it didn't work. tl;dr: Fucking EA can't get their shit together. I get a call up for the euros, but couldn't play. Also have no international games in the following season. I get angry when I think about the 60€ I sacrificed for this.Does anybody have a workaround for this? I'm playing on PS3.

2zxpmf	-31890	1427055361	offmychest	My mom might die very soon	Yesterday, my father called and told me that my mother (56 years old) had a heart attack. She just stood up and immediately collapsed. The doctors had to reanimate her six times. She - or more like her body - is still alive, but nobody knows what's going to happen. Will she survive? If yes, will she be like a human or more like a vegetable? The worst thing is: When my father told me what happened, I felt nothing. I didn't feel sad or shocked. It felt like he just told me that he bought a new chair. I only started tearing up when I heard him crying. I guess my feelings would be different if I actually had witnessed it.I feel genuinely bad for thinking "Welp, we'll have to wait what happens and then we'll see. If she dies, then she dies. Life has to go on." whenever this subject comes into my mind. I don't have a bad relationship with her. I don't know why I just accept this so nonchalantly.

admvg	-31896	1260549050	AskReddit	Reddit, Ive got a Question about Paypal and their BS	I sold an iPod on ebay and sold it to a guy who promptly paid.  Though now my account is on hold with the money and paypal claims I must ship the item, and then when the buyer is satisfied I will get the money.I called and asked a account specialist and she claimed, this is to protect paypal.  I then asked them how can I prove that the buyer actually got the good, and they claimed the tracking number.  But this was a lie, she later admitted.I am a bit weary on shipping out the iPod, as the buyer could literally dispute the charge saying their was no iPod but instead a can of soup in the package.  I then loose the sealed ipod and the money.How should I handle this?  Should I just refund the buyer the money and sell on craigslist.

akoaa	-31896	1262404338	AskReddit	Coming back after school to a single parent and then leaving	I went away to school a few years ago, then graduated in September this year.  I am 24 now.  Upon coming home I moved back into my mothers, where my brother still lives.  My brother is also a college student and will be going away to school for the Spring semester.  So I will be home alone with my mother.  I like living at home with my mother, but to be honest I enjoy living alone or with friends better.  I also don't really like the area in which I live(NYC), ive become more of a fan of the relaxed lifestyle of outer city suburban areas in other parts of NY.Now the problem is, I really only see myself happy if I move away, back to where my school was.  Though I don't want to leave my mom alone, and feel she may go insane if left alone.  I don't want to hurt her feelings and don't want her to go insane, though I really want to leave.  I feel she will be hurt if I leave, but if I dont I will never grow as a person.What can I do?

I read a while ago about a free market economic system which went along as follows.The government would work kind of like we have now, prices will keep going up and the currency will continually debase. The govt will keep regulating making the problem worse.Now this economic idea presented the notion that black markets will form and continue to get stronger and stronger taking up larger parts of the economy. It will do this until there is actually no need for a government anymore and thus it will just go away.There is a name for this idea and I cant seem to remember it.

aqugo	-31896	1263787271	AskReddit	Challenge: reddit I dare you to try natural non detergent based soap for one week and then change back to your normal stuff.	Something most people don't realize is just how horrible detergent based cleansers like AXE, Nivea, lever 2000, Irish Spring, Dove, Dial, etc are for us.  They are simply bottles or bars of ridiculously harmful chemical compositions.  Whether it be PEG, PPG, SLS, etc.  The list is to long to name.  After a while our bodies and senses build up an acceptance of these chemical concoctions and they become acceptable for us to use.  The longer we use them and the more we use them, the more we become accustomed.So I ask everybody to go and buy a cheap bottle or bar of actual soap(not detergent).  Use the soap exclusively for 1-2 weeks, then switch back to your detergent based cleanser.  I guarantee that you will feel as if you are taking a chemical bath with the application of the detergent.  Your sense will go haywire and will almost be in shock to just how bad the detergents are.  You dont need to buy expensive organic soap.  A bar of Tom's of Main soap or any non dial/neutrogena branded glycerine soap will be fine.  If you have a whole foods near you a bar of glycerine soap is about $1 maybe $1.50 if you live in a big city.  Though most supermarkets have a health or organic section so check there.Finding natural soaps was one of the most satisfying things I have ever done.  They clean so much better and do not have all of the included toxicity.  I just want to spread the word.

1wvgt8	-31897	1391408338	Catholicism	Marijuana question	**Since marijuana is slowly being legalized in some states, I was wondering about if it was sinful or not. I have a few bible verses to support it not being sinful (this is from the KJV by the way, just because I could find an easier interface on that site):**Genesis 1:29 - And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which [is] upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which [is] the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.Genesis 9:3 - Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.Matthew 15:11 - Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.Genesis 1:12 - And the earth brought forth grass, [and] herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed [was] in itself, after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good.Psalms 104:14-15 - He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth; **However I have also found bible verses to make it sound sinful:**1 Peter 5:8 - Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:1 Timothy 4:1-6 - Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;   1 Corinthians 6:19-20 - What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost [which is] in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?  **So which is it? I think Matt 15:11 does seem to state that if you control yourself then substances are okay, and I know the bible makes clear that alchohol is ok but drunkardness is not. Then again the whole purpose of marijuana is to alter yourself and your thoughts which could be considered drunkardness. This could be an interesting debate to have.**

I've put on weight and stopped working out. I started PMOing more and I thought the issue was just the move. I've spent a lot of time just feeling negative and upset. After much reflection I now know my issue: PMO. Today I had a very down day and I had a very shameful PMO. Well, fast forward to tonight. All I had to do was say screw this, I'm taking a cold shower and not PMOing in there. Well, I hop out of the shower and walk into my room and turn on some motivational music. I crank out my homework and log onto this old reddit account that I made a very positive and motivational atmosphere. I'm literally just on a happiness high and just feel great about myself. I'm about to go on a run in only 4 and a half hours after I write this at 5:30 am. I'm just feeling great. NoFap is a powerful thing. It was the tool in my change. Lets do this guys.

2ywrrf	-31906	1426255091	DestinyTheGame	[Question] Super Specific Crota ?'s. Bug/Change in Mechanic/Bad Timing?	My group of 4 finally found another pair of brothers to start consistently going through things. The last 2 nights have been our first Crota run as a team - a few of us have gone through the fights with other pugs, but certaintly aren't experts.On the Crota fight last night we had a few unexpected situations and I'm looking for help to understand if there's been slight mechanics changes, or if what we saw were signs of bugs, or if we're still just off and not getting the timing down right.1) Our focus was using the LH side facing Crota so we only deal with one half of the boomer balconies. After the first Swordbearer would come out and go down, Crota would quickly move to the right pretty consistently. (7 of the 10 tries). Our thoughts were that we're either a)not getting the Swordbearer down fast enough b) someone's too close and it's making him move or c) change in mechanics.2) 3 or 4 times the Ogres spawned after a single Swordbearer.3) Every time we would go to the bottom center room to deal with Ogres, Crota would move to the middle starting area (back above us). Is this new or Standard Operating Procedure?The good news is we were able to get consistently up to 2 sword cycles, but it seems every time we'd get deep something weird would come up.Thanks for any feedback!

It was very awkward editing - basically they zoomed in on Seth's face as he was coming in for the finisher, then quickly cut to him covering for the pin.  They also edited out the reference to the closer so it was never mentioned by name. Are they really going to do this on the (I'm making this up but I'm sure is coming soon) "Rise of Seth Rollins" Blu-Ray?  Basically edit out all the endings to his matches?  I'm still confused by this.  In a world where EVERYTHING gets used as an angle - to have this not even addressed as part of the show or breaking Kayfabe is...odd.

Why has there been such a shift from FFE (not including stupid cannon-rush openers)? I might be wrong, but it seems on *most* maps you can just FFE, build *one* zealot and drone like a zerg until you have a full 2base saturation and there's not really much zerg can do about it; if they build lings you can always put down more zealots, roaches die to forcefields + the eventual robo, etc.So, why the shift away?

Before you start typing into the reply box, read the following:* This is a civilised argument. Assume that I, and all others, are intelligent human beings (even if they play protoss!). Try to make your point in a logically coherent way. This means, for example "Blink is too OP" is retarded and should be downvoted to oblivion. However, "Blink is too OP on maps like Heavy Rain, where the entire base is exposed" is legitimate.* If you're below Masters league, you should be here to learn and not to argue. This means that you can say things like "I think forcefields are broken" but if a GM player turns around and says "actually no they're good for these reasons" then shut up and accept it. * Try to be constructive with your argument. If you think the entire Protoss race needs a redesign, that's fine, but we all know Blizzard will never ever ever *ever* do this. As such, I would prefer if people make points that have the remote possibility of one day making it to a patch, rather than just deleting Protoss and starting again.Full disclosure: I'm a plat 'toss. My opinions aren't infallible, which is why I want to see this thread, so I can learn from it and understand what people think needs to be changed. Of course, I'd be surprised if I agreed with everything that was said because of race bias, but that doesn't mean I won't accept that the opinion of those more well versed in the game than I is more valid than my own opinion (and you should do the same).kgo. Let that Protoss hate come forward!(EDIT: typo: "remove possibility" -&gt; "remote possibility")

It very much seems like an absolute lottery at a scrum: 16 men all end up head-first into the ground and the referee penalises only one of the teams for collapsing, or X's scrum is just horrifically weak on one side, Y drives and gets called for wheeling.Is there some part of the dark art of scrummaging that I'm missing? How can referees determine penalties in a clear-cut way? Are there obvious tricks a player can use to collapse a scrum and have the penalty awarded to their team?

I'm from Melbourne, Australia but currently am visiting Seattle, WA for the next few weeks and have the urge to smoke a cigar while I'm here. Can any of you fine folk recommend a good B&amp;M in the Seattle area? I'm in Capitol Hill and don't have any problem walking a few miles for a good place, though don't have a car so anything e.g. Tacoma way is a little too far away. Thanks!

I might not be around for the next HERF or two, but I'll make sure to fly up once I move to SF just to hang out with you all again -- next time, hopefully with a traveldor to bomb a few sticks back ;)

31yy3j	-31910	1428560551	rugbyunion	Laws question: Minimum number of players on the field.	So last weekend we saw the hilarious situation where the Crusaders had 3 men in the bin and the Sharks had a man sent off. Thinking about the hypothetical where they were all sent off (permanently) rather than just sin-binned, my question is what's the minimum number of players allowed on the field after the game has started? I know FIFA's law 3 orders a referee to stop a match if there have been 5 players on the one team sent off, but I can't find any similar Law for rugby.Could you, in effect, see a game that started as 15 v 15 but ended as 9 on 15 or something equally absurd?

First of all, let me apologize to those who cringe when they read this and realize that **I am terribly vain** and perhaps woefully misinformed.At the moment, I'm more concerned with having a toned, cut physique than how much I can deep squat. I honestly don't know if my goals contradict Fittit principles or not.I am young, have very low body fat and a slightly cut upper-body, and I will honestly admit that I'd like to look more like Brad Pitt in Fight Club or Gerard Butler in 300 than a powerlifter. I've been looking into lifting programs like Starting Strength and wondering whether my goals would be better met by a regimen of higher reps and more specific lifts.Feel free to tell me that I am completely wrong and that properly performed 3x5 squats and deadlifts *are* the most efficient means toward a great physique.So Fittit, is the path to being the strongest the same as the path as looking the best?P.S.- I do understand that the more time I put into working out, the better I will look no matter what, barring complete ignorance. I just want to know the most efficient plan.

inwg4	-31913	1310513173	wp7	Any idea when Verizon will release a new wp7 device?	I spoke with a Verizon salesman and he said he didn't expect to see a new wp7 device until the end of the year. I doubt my battered Droid will last that long. Should I go with the HTC Trophy? Should I switch carriers even though I am currently grandfathered into Verizon's unlimited data?I'm really enamored with Mango and Metro but I don't want to screw myself over with hardware that's behind the rest.tl:dr: When will we see a new wp7 Verizon phone? If not soon, is it worth switching from unlimited data to a new carrier?
iqsr8	-31913	1310766488	wp7	Is it just me or is the arrow on the wp7 home screen a poor design?	I'm new to Windows 7 Phones, and I've swiftly fallen in love with Metro UI etc., but every time I look at the home screen of a Windows phone, I can't help but lament over how much screen real estate the arrow in the top right corner takes up. I'm sure most of you know what I'm talking about, but the arrow in question can be seen [here](http://www.tech-exclusive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/WindowsPhone7Homescreen.png).Forgive me if this has been discussed before, but is there a less spacious solution to the function performed by this button?

ukp7h	-31913	1338838559	arduino	I'm confused about the fundamental function of the Arduino: When I finish an Arduino project, do I need to buy another Arduino to do another project if I want to keep the older one doing its thing?	Sorry for the confusing title. I jumped into Arduino stuff with essentially zero prior knowledge of microcontrollers and embedded electronics, so I have gaping holes in my understanding of how things work. I programmed my arduino to run a light that changes color with temperature; now I want to use this in real life. Do I need to buy a whole new arduino to do cool other projects or can I simply pop out the microcontroller from my original Arduino,  hook it up to a power source, and connect the pins the same way they were on the arduino  now that I no longer need to reprogram the microcontroller? Are there any considerations for running a microcontroller standalone?Sorry if this is incomprehensible. Ill be off my mobile phone to check it for clarity in a few hours. Any help or advice/links are appreciated. **UPDATE** Thanks for all the help, y'all. I'm learning a lot. Just to clarify, I'm interested in moving my microcontroller to a finalized custom setup, with no more prototyping necessary. A lot of the recommendations seem to include some setup that still includes USB communication. Wouldn't this be superfluous if I literally wanted to stick my project outside and never modify it again?

So we started reading "A Wrinkle In Time," and I was surprised by how religious it was. In hind sight I should have read it again myself first. I was raised Catholic, and I guess that stuff didn't register as weird when I was young. I am reluctant to share some others that I loved (e.g. The Chronicles of Narnia/The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe) because I know they have religious undertones. On the other hand, I would say that in some ways the ending of the last book in the Narnia series helped (in a small way) to push me away from religion. It was just so over-the-top ridiculous that it seemed to be making fun of the rest of the books. When I later found out that the ending was meant to be an allegory for the Book of Revelations... my opinion of both books went down a bit.I know some good books/authors for when he gets a bit older (Douglas Adams, Larry Niven, Terry Pratchett), but what about now?That all being said, am I being a bit overzealous? Is religion in fiction that bad? That is kind of where it belongs, right?

My app is completely native and supports down to jelly bean where as his only supports kit kat and up. His app will have a few more features at launch though. Both apps will be free to try. I was really bummed out at first since I'm up against a guy who has a lot of experience, i am gonna do my best no matter what, just hoping to hear your thoughts. Thank you.

yrt0g	-31919	1345839554	gamegrumps	JonTron on Skyward Sword	This subreddit might not be the BEST place to throw out this idea, but i figured since it was being discussed how much Jon (and Arin) hate Skyward Sword in one of their New Super Mario Bros. GameGrumps videos, it would be appropriate. I think it would be interesting if Jon were to make a video about Skyward Sword in the same fashion as his Banjo Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts video. This is also widely appropriate because to him (and many others) BOTH franchises were amazing up until their most recent installments into their respective franchises. Both games' predecessors had been following a particular formula, and then upon their most recent games, (Skyward Sword and Banjo Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts) there has been a completely different spin on their gameplay/story/etc. Do you guys think it would be interesting to see this on a JonTron video, if he were to ever make a video dedicated to discussing Skyward Sword's flaws? And yes i know Arin is supposedly working on a Zelda themed Sequelitis video, but Jon would be focused on JUST Skyward Sword, as opposed to Arin who would be focusing on all or most of the games in the Zelda franchise. I'd appreciate reading all of your thoughts on this topic. :)

Anyone else noticing that whenever there's a guy with long brown hair parted from the center like Arin's, grumplings immediately feel the urge to make a post or comment about it? A lot of men have long brown hair similar to his style. Try to focus more on the facial features. This really grinds my gears. And fuckin' real talk? I don't think Spencer Shea from iCarly and Arin look anything alike.

Jon had previously said that he REALLY wants to have JonTron panels, or just attend panels in general in the future (No, I don't remember what episode he said that in). Now that Jon is going to be even bigger than he was before, he makes up for what fanbase gathering he'd have at a GameGrumps panel with who will be at his JonTron panel. I'm excited for Jon's future and I'm also excited to see Danny and Arin at their panel, oh yeah and Ross too. As long as they don't have any sudden random changes. But yeah. I'm done typing now.

1hw7kt	-31919	1373322311	metalgearsolid	Is Peace Walker worth playing?	So i started Peace Walker and began caring less and less about it. Having 10 minutes of cutscenes and then about 3 minutes of gameplay repeating got on my nerves (not that i don't appreciate the cutscenes, i love that shit) but it just got annoying how the gameplay was lacking, imo. Also, i don't really like the whole 'using a base to get better weapons and soldiers' thing. The whole game kinda just felt meh. Keep in mind I only played like 2 hours of it. I want to play it because it has to do so much with Ground Zeroes and Phantom Pain. Should i force myself to continue? Does it get better? Thanks.

I'm sure Pikmin 3 will be an AMAZING game, but what i treasured the most about the first 2 was that you could go anywhere you want in the level, with everything open to you. I feel like Nintendo will be doing something like what they did with the new Luigi's Mansion, where you play levels, you don't explore a mansion, you move toward your destination. Has it been confirmed if the game is more hand holdy?

Why does the Plasma Wraith have a strong resemblance toward the Mamuta and water wraith? (The water wraith and plasma wraith actually have similar Japanese names). What do you think the object that fell to the Earth was at the end? Food for thought.

I feel as though if I do this, i experience the entirety of the game, and if I don't, i ask myself "why am I playing this if I'm not going to fully complete it?" I feel like I won't genuinely have fun if I don't do this. I ask myself this before I even think about playing any Zelda game, which then makes me avoid playing all together. The desire to fully complete it is just a habit of mine, and I enjoy games that way, but I really want to play Zelda games. Should I only beat the story lines and get whichever pieces of heart/extras i find along the way?

chugs	-31923	1277233315	AskReddit	Tech support guy looking for career growth advice/direction.	My story: I'm a 23 year old working for my resident state government. I've been working at this job for about a year and a half. Previously I interned with the local hospitals IT department for about 2 years. My current work environment consists of a sparse 31 employees that I support. We have two other IT employees here. Our director who is basically a project manager and our network person who checks on our servers and…some other stuff I guess. I don't really get a lot of experience doing much of anything. I mean, we have one of our software vendors setup all of our servers...lol. Most of what I learn here is just picking up bits and pieces as I go. Most often due to my own research on issues. The only "training" I have is an A.S. in Computer Science which was basically a couple programming classes (Note: Not fond of programming). I absolutely love the work environment but don't get much out of it.In the next several years I'll probably be moving to a larger city (approx. 3 times the size) in a close by state with my girlfriend so she can work there. My major concern is job prospects there. I can do my job just fine here but I doubt many places have such a low level of technical skill required. To give you an idea, my biggest accomplishment has been setting up a ghost server.The question: What can I do to acquire some real skills? I don't want to be first level tech support forever. I've looked a little bit into MCITP. This is something like the new MCSE correct? Anyway, I have no idea when it comes to certifications and qualifications and things of that nature. Anyone have any advice on what I should do?**TLDR:** Low skill tech support guy seeks skills for career advancement in hopes of moving to a bigger city. Advice needed and appreciated.

After this happens, the only way I can get the wireless network to connect again is by restarting.The error is: "Error creating interface: 'could not create interface: internal error failed to create (start) interface br0: failed to execute external program - Running 'ifup br0' failed with exit code 1: Determining IP information for br0... failed."I tried the brctl show command and it returns:    br0    0000.0016ea6e1b56     yes     wlan0At this point the ifup br0 and ifup wlan0 commands show nothing.At this point, I can't get a wireless connection anymore and I have to restart. After the restart the brctl show command shows nothing and there is no br0 option in network interfaces.Full disclosure: At some point I deleted the wlan0 connection from the Network Interfaces area of Virt Manager. (Same place as at 9:20 of video 3a.) I think I deleted this because when you created the bridge on eth0, I didn't see it listed as a network interface and thought that this might have been my problem. Thus, trying to create a bridge on wlan0 I chose to remove it first.

I'm an Australian, visiting Ottawa for a few months, and one of the main foods I'm missing while traveling is [Indomie Mi Goreng](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indomie_Mi_goreng), (Or "Crack noodles", since you just can't stop eating them NOM NOM NOM). For young adults, Mi Goreng have basically replaced Meat Pies as the staple diet for Aussies.According to the wiki article, these delicious noodles from Heaven itself can be found in "Some local grocery stores and specialty Asian stores.", but my google searches have been fruitless.Does anyone know any stores in Ottawa where these might be found?

inzqx	-31940	1310520571	googleplus	Hiding an individual circle from main stream	I'm wondering if anyone might have any answers for me, or if not, if they have any thoughts on this topic.One of the things I love about Google+ is the ability to put everyone into appropriate circles so I can filter who I share to, and filter what appears on my stream.But my issue is that I have started 'Following' a couple of people I find interesting, and all their posts appear on my main stream. I understand that when you click on the 'stream' tab, you'll see every post from everyone in your circles, and if you just want to read posts from a particular circle, you click on it's respective tab. What I want, is to be able to read the main stream (so I see posts from 'friends', 'family', etc), but hide an individual circle from the main stream unless I click on that circle specifically. Kind of like how you don't see any Incoming posts unless you click on the 'Incoming' circle. I've looked around, can't find any answers. I've submitted a report and query to Google, but I was wondering if anyone on Reddit had any thoughts on this.EDIT: Thanks to abonet's comment, a much better description of what I mean is stream checkbox selection. The ability to choose however many streams you want to see by checking them.
ipkv6	-31940	1310663119	toronto	Carpool to Ottawa	Hi all. This is probably a long shot but I feel it can't hurt. I'm wondering if there is anyone possibly driving to from Toronto to Ottawa (or passing through etc) on the 16th July. I'm an Australian (22, male) backpacking through Canada, and due to unanticipated circumstances I suddenly need to get to Ottawa. I can split fuel money, and I also have an International Drivers Permit and full Australian Drivers License (it's all nice and legal) if you wish to or are willing to change drivers on the 5-6 hour drive.I will have a large backpack (about 1m tall, little over 1' thick around all sides) and a small carrybag. Easily enough to fit in a backseat or trunk.Anyhow, I figure it's a long shot, but if there is anyone interested or able, please let me know and I'll get in contact with you! Thanks!

jfmlp	-31940	1313065793	facebook	"Hide all future posts" 	Alright, so this is probably unlikely but I thought I'd give it a shot.I've been loving playing around with Google+'s Circle feature, setting it up to determine who I share what with, etc. Really nice and easy.I'm trying to do the same sort of thing in Facebook, but it doesn't seem possible. Here's what's going on:Certain person(s) I want to hide all future posts I make from. As in, I create a status, they cannot see it. I don't want to delete them, because they will chuck a fit (happened before). I don't want to block ALL my posts from them, same reason. Basically, I want to just make it so every post I make from now on, they cannot see. (so I guess it looks like I just haven't been posting).Currently, the only way I know is by clicking the lock icon [and using the 'hide this from' feature](http://i.imgur.com/YbFdZ.png) every time I make a post. Which is a pain, really. If I click 'Make this my default setting', it hides *all* posts, including past ones. So it seems there isn't a way to do this without having to filter each post manually - but I was wondering if anyone knew about any Greasemonkey/Chrome extensions that might have this capability. Or possibly, would be able to make one. I've used other extensions to make Facebook more suitable, thought I'd throw this one out there.Thanks in advance for any responses :)

jspci	-31940	1314177163	melbourne	Any bike riders in /r/melbourne?	I just pulled my bicycle out from the shed for the first time in years. Still mostly in good nick, I've put it in for a full service at the local shop. I want to get out there and ride around some more, use my bike instead of my car for short trips. Exercise, save on fuel, enjoy the good weather that's coming around, etc.So anyone around the Northern suburbs (Preston, Reservoir, Coburg, Northcote, Thornbury etc) do any bike riding, or want to start doing it? I remember a few bike paths, running along the Merri Creek and all. If anyone's interested, let me know! EDIT: [I have made a post on the Melbourne Reddit Meetup group on Facebook,](http://www.facebook.com/groups/melbournereddit/?view=permalink&amp;id=264822760212111) since there seems to be a bit of interest. Hopefully this will garner even more interest. I'm thinking possibly this Sunday. If that is too short notice, let me know either way, because I'd love this to turn into a monthly, or possibly fortnightly thing. Likely on weekends, too.Hope to see more interest!~~EDIT2: [This is a possible route,](http://www.bikely.com/maps/bike-path/Merri-Creek-to-Southbank) one I was thinking of already since I've taken this path so many times before. Though not the entire way, I'd say probably meet up somewhere along that point, one of the parks/reserves and then go the rest of the way. Start north, go south to Southbank. Thoughts?~~EDIT3: [Capital City Trail](http://www.bv.com.au/general/bikes-and-riding/43791/) might be a better one to start with. Nice and central, does a loop around the city, it's a closed off sealed bike path (no cars!). Could easily meet at Fed Square (I should make a sign, heh). Thoughts? I'm going to make a Facebook event for those who use FB, and put up details here.[**Official Facebook event page! CLICKY CLICK**](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=224560260924723)

jvw7t	-31940	1314422724	melbourne	First 'Melbourne Reddit Bike Cruise' tomorrow (Sunday 28th August)	Hi all. Some of you may already know about the bike cruise going on tomorrow [(original post here)](http://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/jspci/any_bike_riders_in_rmelbourne/), this is the official "It's happening!" post with all the details.   [(Details also in the Facebook event page)](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=224560260924723)So here's the deal. Meeting at Federation Square by 2pm. I will be there about 1:30pm, and we will leave at 2 (so try not to be late if you want to leave with us). Look for the bikes, and the idiot holding a sign (you'll know when you see it - Reddit alien, "Melbourne Reddit Bike Ride" or some such).It will be a leisurely cruise along sealed bike trails (no cars), so suitable for all types of bike riders whether you're beginner, intermediate or advanced. The cruise we will be doing is the [Capital City Trail.](http://www.bv.com.au/general/bikes-and-riding/43791/)  [(Clicky for Sightseeing map)](http://www.bv.com.au/file/file/paths-trails/Capital%20City%20Trail%20map.pdf)It is a 30km loop around the city with plenty of sightseeing along the way.We'll be riding anti-clockwise on the trail, so we start off by riding along the Yarra River, then finishing off through Docklands.The full 30km loop might be a bit ambitious for some, but you're more than welcome to just go part of the way. Have a look at the sightseeing map I linked above and see how far you'd like to go. We will be doing the Riverside Riding section first (pink section along the Yarra, up to the Collingwood Children's Farm). Please remember to bring drinks (water etc) as you WILL get dehydrated if you don't drink anything. Bring along snacks as well if you like, as it's quite possible we'll stop for a bit of a picnic/chillout along the way.Feel free to invite anyone you like, it's an open event and should hopefully be lots of fun!If you need to, you can call me on this number: 0403 990 207.  (It's a $2 SIM I picked up today as I don't want to post my real number online. I don't have any credit on it, so call don't text. I won't be able to reply).Hope to see you guys there!**EDIT: **Bike ride went well! There were 6 of us, we went along the full Capital City Trail. And we only got lost once! Or twice, sorta. But was good. [I've uploaded the photos into an imgur album here.](http://imgur.com/a/ykQHX#5xXk6) Thanks to everyone who came! Should be another one in the coming weeks.

k7ety	-31940	1315386249	melbourne	End of the Line...?	I don't know if anyone else knows of this pub in Preston/Regent, but it's been puzzling me for a long time. It's called 'End of the Line', and it's... well, at the end of the 112 West Preston/St. Kilda tram line, at the Gilbert Rd./Regent St. intersection. [Here is a link to it on Google Maps. (Building with 'Live Music' sign).](http://maps.google.com.au/maps?q=regent+street+preston&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=-37.729334,144.991556&amp;spn=0.000392,0.002747&amp;sll=-25.335448,135.745076&amp;sspn=32.012754,56.513672&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;z=19&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=-37.729334,144.991557&amp;panoid=iVsX2vh6l_TFRZydwaTHhQ&amp;cbp=11,287.2,,1,-0.07)I walk past it a lot at all hours of the day/night at various times in the week. When it (occasionally) appears to be open, it has an iron gate in front of it, but the inner door wide open. I peer inside as I walk past and it might have 2-3 people hanging around the bar drinking, but that's it. Looks like it's equipped enough to hold a reasonable amount of people, and looks quite tidy in there ready to go. But it's been like this for a couple of years or so.Anyone have a clue what's up with this place? I'd love to have a local bar close enough to walk to, but it almost seems like this place is run privately for 2-3 people. How odd.

Does anyone know of a good [poutine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poutine) joint in Melbourne? I spent a few months over 2010-2011 in Canada and this became a favourite dish of mine. Been wondering if there are any restaurants or cafes in Melbourne that can make a good dish. Not some place like Lord of the Fries - IIRC they have "French Canadian Chips", but they use shredded cheese instead of cheese curds, and it's revolting. I'll likely just start making them myself at home, but would be nice to find a place that makes some good poutine.

ndmk8	-31940	1323942830	Android	Cheap, basic tablet needed. No spectacular specs, just a nice readable screen.	I've recently been getting into reading comic books, and I've got a whole collection which I've been reading on my PC, Kindle, and more recently my Nexus [using this great app](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.cyo.comicrack.viewer). But for a while I've been really thinking I want a tablet to read the comics off. I tend not to read on my PC, my Kindle is great for books but visibility for comic books is too difficult. My phone works great but of course, small screen.Thing is I can't justify spending a coupla hundred bucks on a tablet which would mainly be used for reading comics and not much else, but I could justify it for less than $100AU.  So basically, was wondering if anyone here had any suggestions or recommendations for cheap underpowered tablets - but with a nice enough screen resolution. I've found plenty on ebay for prices I like, but I can't get a good idea of what the screens are like.(And of course, needs to be compatible with the above linked app).[This is an example of one of the tablets I've found on ebay.](http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/ROM-4G-7-Touch-Screen-Tablet-PC-Google-Android-2-2-OS-800MHz-WiFi-3G-Camera-/270872884208?pt=AU_Tablets&amp;hash=item3f114833f0#ht_11098wt_1139)Thanks!EDIT: Though, that linked tablet has 800x480 resolution which is probably not what I want. I don't think..? Also of concern is battery life, something that'll last 2 hours isn't going to be great for me on my 1.25 hour commute to work...

om6xo	-31940	1326875764	skeptic	A man at work today used a "Heavy Light Pen" on his coffee, and explained it changes the molecular structure and energy of the water. Link inside.	[Heavy Light Pen official website.](http://www.heavylight.de)Basically looks like a pentorch. Or a sonic screwdriver, even. Anyway, I made him a coffee then he started stirring it while shining this 'Heavy Light Pen' into his coffee. Supposedly, the light has a frequency that somehow reacts with the water, changing it's molecular structure or energy. He said it makes water taste "smoother". I was curious but quite sceptical, and decided to check it out when I got home. When he said it makes water taste "smoother", I thought it sounded a little bogus but was curious enough to look it up. After reading the FAQ, my scepticism alarm bells are definitely ringing. It's not just about taste, it's all about healing energies and such. Here's an excerpt: &gt;The procedure for introducing the bio-information by holding the water while illuminating it allows a more precise remedy. This is because the water has been held by your hands and therefore has the unique information from your personal body. The water therefore has an energetic state that can precisely meet the needs of your energetic state at any given time. The light penetrates through the water and consequently affects all the energy carried within the water molecules in the bottle.&gt;The use of HL light to create a vibrational remedy has an energetic effect that can be described as an “energetic kidney” – the action is to dissolve the energetic stagnation that can be stored up for years. This positive movement is the Holy Grail of every natural remedy. It is usually followed by a transformation phase due to the energetic changes that occur.&gt;For those of you who are familiar with healing from a powerful qigong master, it has similarities to when they heal at the information level. It is the most powerful level to perform healing.There is other stuff about using these lights in alternative medicine.Has anyone here come across one of these before? Reminds me a lot of those scammy wristbands.

I turned it into "vita plena malorum, sed semper spes est" - or "Life is full of evil, but there is always hope."Trying to extract on that a bit.. this is what I've come up with:"quamvis plena malorum mundus, ibi erit semper spes."I'm *hoping* it translates to "Although the world is full of evil, there will always be hope."  The 'ibi erit' bit I'm not sure of. ibi is "there" (but I'm not sure it's the right context) and 'erit' is 3rd person singular future indicative of 'sum', so as far as I can tell it would be correct but I'm not certain. Apart from that, I think I've given the correct cases.(Note: This is not my homework, this is just something I'm working on just for fun).

So on Free Comic Book Day, my friend and I went to various stores in Melbourne, Australia as [Batman (myself) and Green Lantern (my friend)](http://i.imgur.com/1gwgw.jpg). We ended up getting the most votes in the store's costume contest on Facebook, and thus both won prizes, which we intended to split. [This is my loot, that I just picked up today.](http://i.imgur.com/Tk59j.jpg)I received a $10 gift voucher at Classic Comics for showing up in cosplay, which I put towards Venom: Lethal Protector and Spawn: Vol. 3. At All Star Comics, I was originally going to just receive the Batman: Under the Red Hood Bluray, comics from FEC and a gift voucher, and my friend was going to receive the Green Lantern Secret Origins/Rebirth box set (as well as gift voucher and t-shirt), however the chaps at All Star had a spare box which they decided to just throw in for me as well! Absolute legends. I bought the remaining books with the gift cards. I'm absolutely stoked. My Batman costume isn't perfect, but I think it was a good creative effort. [I think it looks a bit better in this photo](http://i.imgur.com/uihwu.jpg), minus the lack of eye-black and Batman belt-buckle. I built it out of motocross gear and home-made the cape.Just wanted to say I'm absolutely stoked and I'm overwhelmed with the amount I received in the contest, which I didn't expect us to win in the first place. (Didn't even know there was going to be a contest at first!). The fellas at All Star Comics in Melbourne are absolute legends - I had only been there maybe 3-4 times before, but I'll definitely be hanging out there more in the future. Thanks guys!Next year will be even bigger. Thinking about how I can pull off a Spawn costume.

1e4n6w	-31940	1368282115	comicbooks	Prelude to Knightfall - collected?	Hiya. So before I started buying comics I read Knightfall digitally, and really enjoyed it. Just decided to buy the big fat Vol. 1, but realised it doesn't have any of the prelude issues. It has Vengeance of Bane, but it doesn't have Sword of Azrael, Batman #484-489 or Detective Comics #654-656. Does anyone know if it's possible to find these issues collected? I believe Sword of Azrael has been collected, but it's unavailable where I've looked. But I think more important were the Batman and Detective Comics issues. In Knightfall Vol. 1, [](#s "Batman is already sick and wounded, worn out from the Black Mask gang etc., and it makes references to Jean Paul Valley fighting Killer Croc and meeting Bane.")I know I've read it before in torrents, but I hate jumping back into this big storyline without getting the start of it, and I don't want to have to download comics again. I can't find any info on whether they've been collected, was hoping someone here might be able to help?

What I'm trying to translate is 'Just as I came from the stars, thus shall I go to the stars.'I thought I'd try and adapt the 'reach for the stars/towards the stars' feel of the line from Virgil's Aeneid IX 641-2, and add on 'from the stars', in reference to Carl Sagan's 'we're made of star-stuff' quote.Man, after writing this I realise how pretentious it sounds. I'd still love to know if I got it right though, it's been a while since I've tried to translate something into Latin :) I guess I'm not so sure about the 'sic ibo' being correct for 'thus shall I'. Thanks guys!

2fvzvf	-31940	1410248256	australia	PSA: Hoop Snake season is almost upon us.	Having seen a few Drop Bear posts here in the last couple of days, I thought it would be important to post a reminder that Hoop Shake season is coming up. This is particularly for tourists who are planning on being in Australia over the Spring and Summer seasons. For a bit of background information,  please read and be informed. &gt; the distinguishing feature of a hoop snake is that it can grasp its tail in its jaws and roll after its prey like a wheel, thus looking somewhat like the ouroboros of Greek mythology, or Tsuchinoko(a legendary fat snake that can roll like a wheel) in Japan. Some variants of Hoop Snakes are know to straighten out as they reach their prey, using their speed to become much like a spear, skewering their prey with their venomous tail. Hoop Snakes are particularly venomous and deadly, and death can come quickly and painfully if one does not have the antidote readily at hand. Hoop Snakes are known to live in hilly countrysides, or in otherwise non-heavily developed housing areas. If you're around hilly and grassy areas, be sure to keep an eye uphill at all times, as they're prone to appear almost out of nowhere and can pick up substantial speed. If you see a Hoop Snake approaching, the best method of avoiding them is to duck behind a tree or large boulder etc, which they will strike instead of you. If you have nothing like this around you, remember to stand your ground until the last moment, then jump sideways so they miss you. Please note that this is NOT guaranteed to keep you safe - many underestimate the speed and agility of Hoop Snakes and meet an unfortunate end. But, it may be your best bet. When the Hoop Snake is downhill from you, the danger has generally passed as they're not particularly agile when not rolling, and should be more scared of you than you them. If anyone else has further advice or experience with Hoop Snakes, feel free to comment and contribute! For tourists - I don't mean to frighten you. It may be likely that you'll never see one, just like sharks, blue ringed octopuses, drop bears, etc. But the danger *is* still there, so just stay informed and aware :)

2gmmk8	-31940	1410925253	Malmoe	Student exchange to Malmö University, Spring 2015	Hi guys! I'm an Aussie who's applied for student exchange to Malmö University in Spring 2015, and I had a few questions I'd like to ask. First off, I was wondering if anyone knew what I could typically expect in terms of class/teaching days/hours per week? All I've found on the university's website has been that full-time study is roughly equivalent to a 40 hour work week. My own university says about the same, but in my faculty the contact hours is typically 3 hours per week per subject (4 subjects a semester running at the same time, so 12h/week). Then they recommend about an extra 3 hours of study for every hour of class, so ~48/week. Wondering how this compares to a typical course load at Malmö.Secondly, and this is not something I'll have to worry about until later (still in the initial application process), but accommodation. For university housing, there are three locations on the uni's website. [Celsiusgården](http://www.mah.se/english/Education/Housing/Accommodation/Accommodation-types/Celsiusgarden/), [Rönnen](http://www.mah.se/english/Education/Housing/Accommodation/Accommodation-types/Ronnen/) and [Sege Park](http://www.mah.se/english/Education/Housing/Accommodation/Accommodation-types/Sege-Park/). I'm not sure how much of a choice I'll get, but, if I do get one, any recommendations? I was thinking Celsiusgården, due to it being the cheaper option, plus from the photos it looks nicer. Rönnen was the second choice, and I don't feel particularly interested in Sege Park. Cost isn't a huge issue, though, since I will have more than enough funding. Thirdly, Swedish language! I don't speak any, all I can say is 'hej', which will be useful for greeting people but no further than that haha. I know that English is widely spoken in Sweden, and spoken very well. And all my classes will be in English. But I'd like to try and learn some things before getting in. There *is* a short introductory course to Swedish before the semester starts, but I wouldn't mind getting a head start if possible. I know, I know, it's not necessary, but when I travel I like to at least try to make an effort to learn some basics! Any recommendations for where I could try and learn some basic Swedish? I've downloaded the courses on Rosetta Stone, but I've used RS in the past and I don't find it particularly useful.Thanks guys, and I'm really looking forward to studying there! EDIT: Actually, one other thing. Transit. Worth getting a bike? I enjoy cycling, and *really* enjoy travelling and exploring. I often cycle and explore around my own home city even though I've lived here for nearly 25 years. How much could I expect to pay for a bicycle? And would I have much chance of selling it again before I leave?

I'm glad your phone got smashed when it fell out of your jacket after my other friend ripped it off you. I'm glad you and your friends didn't have a knife, it was certainly a concern of mine when I was screaming at you. I am normally a quiet and reserved person and it doesn't often happen that I get enraged and start screaming and yelling at people like that. So, good work there. I'm glad we got the wallet back from you, and I know the experience won't stop you from stealing and pickpocketing again, but I hope it was enough to make you realise just what a fucking scumbag you actually are. Holy shit I enjoyed making you cry so much, it was almost the highlight of my night watching you blubber. To everyone else, happy new year, and despite that event, I have really enjoyed visiting your beautiful city for New Years. Fohres neues Jahr from Australians!

Website www.vibraveil.com, www.facebook.com/vibraveil.We have played a number of gigs in 2014, including John Curtin (twice), Bar Open, Workers Club, Vinyl Bar and Whole Lotta Love. Have to say the John Curtin is by far my favourite place to play so far. We have a full-length album out, called Neurotonus. A few of the songs are available to stream on our website, and we can be searched on YouTube as well. Archetype, Tyrannicide and Schema 18. A live recording of Space Machine is online as well. I'm actually overseas on student exchange for the first half of 2015 so we are unlikely to do any more gigs for a while (unless the others find a temp drummer), but a new set of songs are being worked on and we should have a new set list for the second half of the year :) Check us out if you like, and let me know what you think! :)

For example, I was taught at an early age that if I'm ever stranded/lost in Antarctica and run out of food, I must not eat the liver of my sled dogs. Handy advice for if I'm ever in that situation, as eating dog liver can give you [a toxic dose of Vitamin A](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervitaminosis_A#History), however it is incredibly unlikely that I will *ever* be in that situation. Nonetheless, this advice has stuck with me my whole life. I'm interested to know if you have been given advice that you would likely *never* have to use, advice that seems strange, but that has stuck in your mind.

2x81hw	-31940	1424949668	Wet_Shavers	Bad shaving rash... what do?	Hi guys. Recently I bought a DE kit, as it's something I've been wanting to do for ages, and I had heard it might help out with shaving rash. So I've done my research, followed youtube and wiki guides, and have followed them as well as I can. I have a shower then use a hot towel, lather up well, then make a few passes. I go with the grain in ~5cm patches, reducing but not eliminating the beard. Then I lather up again, do another pass across the grain. I might do 2-3 of these types of passes before doing a final one against the grain. I'm careful about tugging and scraping on my face, I do it slowly and methodically. Then I wet the alum block and rub it on my face, leave it for a bit then rinse it off. Then I use an alcohol-free aftershave balm. Despite this, [I still end up looking like I have terrible acne on my face and neck.](http://i.imgur.com/avLZwqU.jpg) I don't actually have any acne on my face, save maybe 1 tiny pimple, but the way I look right now suggests otherwise. I shaved about an hour ago, and just took this photo. My face feels like it's burning a bit, even after rinsing it again. I've used the DE on about 5-6 shaves so far, and all but one of them has ended up like this. I've used a couple of different blade brands, too.I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong here, but this is horrible :\ Any advice?Edit: I've been told you can use the blade maybe 2-3 times, or least until it feels like it's tugging and scraping. Should I instead be replacing it after every shave? The one shave I had that was good was when I used a fresh Astra platinum, but then the 2nd and 3rd time I used that same blade, I came out like this. I also wonder if I should avoid going against the grain on that final pass - though I was also under the impression that it's fine for the final pass. Avoiding it also means I don't get a fully smooth shave... But even that has got to be better than looking like a spotty teenager. EDIT 2:Okay, lots of things to think about for my next shave. I'll test out the different things carefully and figure out what works best for me. May have just been a bit too ambitious with my first few DE shaves :) Thanks so much for the advice, everyone!

30l7e8	-31940	1427538787	GODUS	Impossible chests?	Hi guys. Just started playing the game recently, and I'm just wondering how I'm meant to get [chests like these](http://i.imgur.com/6KIaaE1.jpg), that are apparently impossible to get to. They're buried beneath layers that I'm unable to sculpt. I've got the deep sea sculpting card, but the layers I'd have to sculpt to get to these chests are on the edge of the map, which are greyed out, and there are no beacons there (this is near the bottom of the map, where you start out). What do? This is particularly frustrating because chests just don't seem to be spawning for me anymore. I get maybe 1-2 a day, and I check the game very regularly. I got a whole bunch of those journal chests when I updated last night, but can't find any sticker chests anywhere... :/

Next, was popular media like tv and video games, but I didn't like making skins of something that already existed (and has probably already been done better before). And my final attempt at reviving my creative spark was just pain doodling in my sketchbook for a couple hours at a time.

So I log in to the campus site and access my personal page. I click the "view schedule" button and it tells me that I have no classes for that term (Fall 2015). Dad and I were both shocked and confused about this so I relog and try again... same page, same message. We checked the payment log because I had already paid for the classed I had signed up for. The payment history was there, but it said I didn't pay for anything in particular.

Towards the end of the season we saw Yates' trying to get back at Frank for firing him so he'd be the best candidate to be the author. The only way we'd get to hear the whole story is through Claire and or possible Doug.

u0jig	-31954	1337747880	relationships	I feel as thought my girlfriend succeeded in inception. Now I don't know what to do. Advice?	So we're young, both 19, but have been in a committed relationship that has largely been long distance for about 2 years. By largely long distance I mean she has been at a different college than me for two years, but over the summer we are only 10 minutes apart. Anyway, a little bit of background first. She battled anorexia in highschool, but is doing much better with it now. She no longer skips meals but still has awful self-esteem and is dieting. Furthermore, her family situation is questionable at best, and she has slipped into depression for about a year and a half now. Inception time. So she was in a very bad funk one day and I was trying to help her cheer up a bit as usual. Somehow the topic of me caring came up and she said something similar to the following, "Sometimes I'm not sure if you actually care or if you have convinced yourself that you do after having put in so much time and effort." To be honest, I was stung by this, but attributed it to her down mood. She later apologized when she was feeling better confirming what I had thought that it was, as she calls it, "the monster inside [her] talking". She hasn't mentioned it since, but like inception, the possibility has slowly begun creeping over me and now I'm seriously questioning things. In a sense I also feel trapped because she has some suicidal tendencies and I feel as though (and she has said things along these lines) that I am a stable part of her hectic life. I'm not saying that I definitely want to end it, in fact I would rather just get rid of this thought entirely, but if for whatever reason I did, I wouldn't want her to do anything to harm herself. The guilt I would feel would be near unbearable. So I guess this brings me back to my original question: How do I get this thought out of my head? Any and all advice is appreciated!tl;drGirlfriend of just over 2 years is depressed. One day in a particularly depressed state said something to make me question my feelings for her and now I can't get that thought out of my head.

After my girlfriend cheated on her econ test she justified it this way, "If I don't do well on this test, I won't get into the business program, and I NEED to get into it if I want to do anything with my life."Clearing studying wasn't an option all semester because she's too concerned with going to parties to actually learn the material.

So from my understanding, when you consider yourself in a dangerous situation, your body releases stress hormones such as cortisol and norepinephrine in response to the situation. Now if you simply google ways to deal with stress, you get a whole host of things such as a healthier diet, more exercise, relaxations and yoga, but none of these explain what happens to the cortisol and whatnot in your body. Does it just go away over time or when you're in a more relaxed state, is there something that is released in your body that breaks down these stress hormones? tl;dr How does your body chemically deal with stress hormones?

Hi /r/learnmath, I was notified of a potential research opportunity at my university for this summer. The professor's project has to do with knot theory, and I'm just trying to get an idea of the subject and if I'd be interested. I just finished watching the following video about it and was wondering if anyone had any good resources that they know of. Thanks!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbSgU66ISS0

Well it arrived to today and I went through a good looking lubrication guide via youtube and it flows like butter. The only problem is, now that its so smooth, it has the tendancy to pop....a lot. I have a guhong V2 that I'm going to lube as well and I know that will be more or less fine with the torpedo's, but what do I do with the V1?tl;dr Lubed my 3x3x3 and now its popping a lot. Any easy fixes? Tightening it more?

In an optional keeper league that I'm in, you are allowed to keep 0, 1, or 2, but if you keep 2, one must be a pitcher, and one must be a position player. Seeing as Weaver was my best pitcher, I opted to only keep Mike Trout, while everyone else kept 2. Now I'm faced with a decision, McCutchen, Tulowitzki or Kemp, virtually for free in the second round.Tulo only played 47 games last year, and the shortstop position has some other intriguing names such as Jose Reyes, ian Desmond, and Zobrist. Kemp played 106, but in in his previous 2 years, only missed 1 game. However, he's coming off of off-season shoulder surgery. McCutchen played 157 and had a great year last year, but also had a BABIP of .375. Given that you already have Trout, who do you take of the three and why? 
1bykus	-31954	1365471410	fantasybaseball	H2H Points League, Youkilis for Bruce accepted as equal?	Am I just crazy or does this not seem equal at all? Its a bit of a strange league where you only start 9 batters and typically have ~8 on the bench. Its also only 8 teams, so most people's rosters are quite good. I just see this as trading a backup 3B in the league for a starting RF. Youk turned 34 this year and has seen a steady decline in ISO, AVG, OBP, and Slugging, and has played less than 125 games the past 3 seasons. His numbers would probably look more like Bruce's if he stayed healthy all year, but the last time he played over 140 games was in 2008.Bruce is 26, and had a BABIP last year only a little over average at .297, and Great American Ballpark is even better for hitting homers than Yankee Stadium. Plus he still has Phillips, Votto, Choo, and Ludwick when he gets back from the DL. To be fair, 3B is really shallow at the moment in that league, with Pedro Alvarez and Trevor Plouf being the "big names" left. Is it just me or did the guy getting Bruce win big time on this one?
1d2yzb	-31954	1366898079	fantasybaseball	At what point do we sell high on Justin Upton?	I'm a known numbers guy and decided to take a look at Upton so far this year against his career numbers. This year marks his 5th full year at the major league level and he turns 26 this August.Now currently, he's on pace to hit about 84 HR's, clearly that will not happen, and a lot of that is attributed to his current 38% HR/FB. His career average in that category is 14%. To further back up that statistic, his ISO is currently at a whopping .481, .275 better than his average of .206. Given that he already has 11 in the bag, I can see him hitting around 40 HR this year if not more, but he's bound to hit the wall at some point and have a nasty slump with a bunch of pop-outs. Is now a good time to sell high on him? And if so, what are you asking for in return?*EDIT*Adding to the likely hood that his HR/FB goes down, while a third of his HR have been considered "No Doubt" by the HR tracker, nearly half have been "Just Enough".[Source](http://www.hittrackeronline.com/detail.php?id=2013_16&amp;type=hitter)

I've seen enough about 4x4's in general to know that that's common, but I can't figure out how to rotate the inner and outer sides independently of each other.

1euhyi	-31954	1369244809	fantasybaseball	[TRADE] Pedroia and Gallardo for Fielder and Cueto	First off, this is a 8 team H2H Points League, where benches are very deep, so FA's are slim pickings except for 1B, where players like Morneau and Berkman are still available. I know that it looks lopsided at first sight, but right now, my 2B is Neil Walker/Dan Uggla and I have Goldschmidt filling my Util position, with Jennings riding the bench.The rest of my pitching staff is Masterson, Kuroda, Iwakuma, Sale, Darvish, with Weaver on my DL. Thus, is Gallardo doesn't pick it up by the time Weaver comes back, he's probably the one to get the boot. Should I counter trying to get Buchholz or Sanchez? He's a Sox fan so Buch might be a bit pricier in his eyes. 
1ewmhh	-31954	1369321008	fantasybaseball	Of these starting pitchers moving forward, who's the oddman out?	Between Masterson, Iwakuma, Kuroda, and Gallardo, who are you getting rid of and why?Kuroda's back/calf problems last start scare me a bit as he's 38, but he's been pitching really well. Gallardo's just been so awful lately, and his numbers don't show any signs of turning it around. 
1fdpdz	-31954	1369967906	fantasybaseball	How much value do the top catchers carry?	In one of my points leagues, I'm in need of a catcher, and have a surplus of good pitching: Kuroda, Masterson, Iwakuma, Cueto, Weaver, Darvish, Sale. My question is, of what value are players like Napoli, Mauer, Santana, and McCann. Seeing as it's a points league, what do you see as some examples of fair trades for these guys? I'm thinking of offering something along the lines of Weaver/Cueto for McCann of Masterson for Napoli.

I'm watching the Orioles/Angels game and watching him try and run the bases is just painful. Between his plantar fasciltis and his knee, he hobbles from base to base. So like the title states, at what point do the Angels look at their investment, which goes for another 8 years, ~200 million dollars, and shut him down so he can heal and return to his potential?
1g5s3a	-31954	1370995068	fantasybaseball	[Trade] Value of Miguel Cabrera?	Obviously he's the best fantasy player there is, but in a trade, what is his actual value? The current situation (10 team H2H redraft) is that the other owner's team lost Sandoval to the DL, and now needs a replacement. I have a spare outfielder and was thinking about fiddling with Cabrera. Is something like Cabrera, Zobrist, Luccroy for Pedroia, Napoli, Samardzija enough or is that still selling low on cabrera? I'd have Prado to take over 3rd, and the pitcher I'd be dropping to make room is likely Fernandez or maybe Kyle Lohse. What is realistic value for him or is there no trade that would really benefit both teams?[For reference, the order is my batters, pitchers, and then his batters and pitchers.](http://imgur.com/a/wjGi3)

He's [19] been looking now for 2-3 weeks, has sent applications to nearly everything imaginable in the area for just a regular summer job doing retail or something in the food industry. Has had 2 interviews, both seemingly went well, but the first was only looking for long term employees, and he has no idea what happened with the second. Good interview, everything went well, has worked a similar position before, and nothing. He's asked me what he should do going forward, but I don't know what to tell him to do. He's started studying for the first actuarial exam that he's going to take next month (he's a math major), but that doesn't really help him for this summer.

My pitching is old and not very good, Myers and Jackie Bradley are my top really young guys. I know I'm not really in contention for this year, so this trade isn't super useful for me. In the act of trying to figure out a counter though, I'm struggling on placing a value on a young kid with talent. Is Myers for Wacha and Kimbrel reasonable? Would I have to toss in another player if I wanted something like Wacha and Zunino? Is that asking too much? Not Enough? What I'm saying is I have no way of putting a value to these guys for the years to come. Or is it really just a gut call on how you think they do and balancing your right now for the future? Any advice for a new owner to a dynasty league?As a side note, this is a league I joined via this subreddit, so just know other owner I'm not ignoring your trade, just getting a feel for what I might counter with.

1irpa2	-31954	1374440159	fantasybaseball	Why don't more people own Jarrod Parker?	I realize when you look at his raw numbers on the year, his ERA is near 4, and has a whip of 1.2, but excluding the start where he got hurt and only pitched 3.1 innings, he has 11 QS in a row, with some of them being against quality teams like Stl, Tex, and Bos. Over the months of June and July he's sporting a 2.24 ERA and hitters are batting about .165 against him. What's not to like? Yes his K rate could be a bit better, but he helps your ERA, WHIP, and being in the A's has a pretty good chance at a W every time he takes the mound. Anyone else amazed he's only owned in 66% of leagues? Oh yea, he starts against the Astros on Tuesday. If he's available in your league go grab him!

Hey guys, just a quick question because I'm a bit confused by a classmate's proof of Wilson's Theorem. He used induction on k, where k+1 is the next prime, and k-1 is the prime before. Base case of 2 is easy, if you assume it to be true for k, you can take (k)! = 0 mod (k) , and 0 mod k = -1 mod k+1. I guess my first question is, can you do that with induction? I was under the impression that k+1 had to actually be something like 5 --&gt; 6, but can you make it an index of sorts?Second of all, does his proof even work? I managed to do it another way, but I'd really appreciate it if you guys could help me out. Thanks!

2eg00i	-31954	1408889049	fantasybaseball	Start 1 today: Iwakuma against BOS, or Fiers against PIT?	Huge dilemma for me today, I have both guys but can only start 1 due to weekly start limits in our points league.Iwakuma has been killing it lately, 5 games with QS, boasting a .99 ERA and a 7.9 K/9 over that time period. However, his career stats against the active BoSox roster is horrendous. BAA of .388 and an OPS of 1.2. In his earlier start against them this season he went 4 innings and gave up 5 ER. Fiers meanwhile has killed it over his last 3 starts, with a .85 ERA and 10.7 K/9 over that time, but that's largely due to his 14 K performance against the Cubs. He hasn't faced the Pirates yet this year, but their bats have come alive the last 3 games, scoring 20 runs. If you could only pick one, who do you take? Keep in mind that this is  a points league, so a W is huge (+5) and a loss is just as much of a game changer (-5).Right now I'm leaning toward Iwakuma because the Sox have been so bad, but his career stats against them are terrifying. In addition, I haven't seen Fiers pitch at all, just heard a lot of great things about him. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!

Hi, I'm not a regular /r/refigeration reader, but it seems like the place to ask this question.  &amp;nbsp;I'm just curious at the moment, are there any "vented" refrigerators?  i.e a fridge that pulls/expels air form outside – or better yet can pull/expel form either inside or outside.  It seem sort of nuts in places with winter that we heat our homes and then our fridges suck in the hot air we heated (right?) and cool it down.   It seems like if the fridge could pull air in from outside during the winter months, the compressor &amp; coolant would seldom be needed – just some fans to move the air into the fridge.  And in the summer, when the a/c is cranked the same fridge could suck in cold air from the home and expel the hot air outside instead of warming up the cool house.  Is this something standard on bigger industrial/walk-in fridges?  &amp;nbsp;Wouldn't a system like this save a lot of energy(money)?

Lol.I am having a problem when I use "merge corrections" from a source sequence.  The correction ends up applying, but looks totally different.  It also only applies if "tape" is selected, which seems weird to me, but I don't do a ton of correction so maybe that's normal?

The edits on these example clips are exactly the same, but the problem occurs throughout the record sequence.  Any advice as to why this is not working correctly?

The reflections are of boom/camera and are pretty much just "shadow" silhouette reflections.  Shots are moving handheld/dolly shots and the camera is looking through the window.

This next revision I am looking to start a clan for anyone who hates wearing armor but loves Sharp V stone swords. Though we will suit up for group PVP occasionally. The clan will have seperate chests for most people, and about 20 shared chests for building materials and things that arent valuable, like sharp 3 stone swards. We will have a tunnel with a minecart system that goes all the way out to close to the edge of the world for mining. I will be claiming a 150x150 close to spawn to build my castle as it only needs a 48x48 base, there will be lots of room for other things. Here is what I have been working on in creative currently:http://www.mediafire.com/?9ykoj5md38lyhq2 The build will require about 33k Stone bricks, so thats 11 double chests full. I collected about 7 double chests full on rev 20 before I realized by the time I finish the build the rev would be just about over.If you want to join for next Rev just send me a PM on reddit, or ingame

Currently I am working on making a cave spider spawner on S that is a lot different than most grinders, and is a high amount of trial and error with the placing of water and such. By the time I am done i will probably need to place over 50 modreqs for flowing. I propose that their be a system for flowing water, just some brainstorming here. to flow water you could possibly use a /flow command while waiting 30 secs before it flows, so it could not be used in PVP. Some of the precedents to the command would be:1) Having a certain number of hours playing like maybe 25 hours2) Having no rule infractions for griefing3) Do a /modreq after those are met for permissions to the /flow command, with the final decision being made by the moderators.4) Abuse of /flow would mean having the command revoked or a ban/warning. I think some of you will take a look at these and tell me if you think it would be usefull and provide feedback. Also since I don't play on P that much it would probably be a bit different situation over there.-Nbroosky your friendly stone sword wielder.

I know that from an evolutionary perspective it isn't good for members of the same gene pool to see each other as food, simply because predatory behaviour within that gene pool would diminish its size, thereby causing evolutionary pressure against cannibalism, but beyond that is there any reason why an individual should avoid ingesting the flesh of its own species? And if not, why don't more animals eat their dead?

I'm not designing flux capacitors here, my specs are about as simple as they get.The one issue that I have with illustrator is that once I've finished the spec its a real pain to go back and change any part of the design. For instance, if I increase the size of a frame by 1%, I have to go around and remeasure and type every numeral on the page. If Illustrator knew I was creating a spec, it would work all that out automatically.It would be really awesome if theres some kind of program identical to Illustrator, but specifically for making technical drawings. Does such a thing exist?Thanks legends.EDIT: formatting

12bho5	-31971	1351566820	malefashionadvice	Quick question about etiquette on this subreddit.	I quit my job and launched my own eyewear label last year, and I'm about to go into my second range. My first range was pretty safe, so while I was proud of the product I didn't really want to post it all over town like I'm the new Tom Ford. The next range is more inventive, and a lot more masculine, so I want to throw it up on /r/malefashionadvice and see what you guys think, and I also want to offer a discount code for my fellow redditors to use.Its a business, so I suppose that kind of activity kind of counts as promotional. I really just want you guys commenting on my stuff and hopefully wearing it too, but would submitting my own brand and offering a discount code be breaking the rules? Do you have any suggestions?

As long as she ends up happy I don't care what she does, but it would be great if she can utilize her skill set. Are there some options I haven't though of for a brilliant young teacher who is a master with children?

So with the influx of new accounts and really obvious cheaters recently due to the steam sale, I was wondering what peoples thoughts were on people that have VAC bans etc on their steam profiles? Last night we came across a guy that pulled off some really suspicious shots on de_cache and then was giving the smack talk "what ranks are you" etc and insulting our team, at the end of the game it showed that he was DMG, the same as my main account (why do I have 2 accounts you ask, it's a backup to play with some new to cs friends and I've had a few disconnect bans from rage quitting from spinhackers etc)So I check this guys profile and see 416 days since last VAC ban, ok great, so I know this guy has cheated in the past, why should I trust that he's not at it again?Should there be a closer eye kept on players that have hacked in the past do we think? maybe something like under team name or something CHEATER as a clan tag, this may deter them from cheating in the first place and having their account permanently tarred with this.Any thoughts/suggestions?

2zccn5	-31989	1426594520	GlobalOffensive	The whole Maikelele vs Allu argument.	So I was really sitting thinking about it last night when I saw that Maikelele was streaming, so I flicked on his stream and literally heard him moaning for around 10 minutes before I turned it off.He was moaning about his luck with cases and constantly saying shit shit shit shit shit..Then it finally made sense to me based on all the rumours, speculation, whatever.The NiP players (GTR, f0rest, Xizt, Friberg) have all made it very clear in recent interviews that Allu is extremely calm and positive.In NiP's official statement I think they were very naive coming out and saying that Maikelele wasn't experienced enough and they had made him away of his shortcomings and he had time to improve these. As my personal opinion is that Maikelele was being what we call in the sales environment a "mood hoover" basically dragging the morale of the team down if he or the team wasn't performing very well.There's absolutely no doubting the guys ability, but sometimes you just don't gel with others.  Where as Allu seems to be much closer to Fifflaren in terms of the "gel" with the team.Sad to see really but that's the way team sports often work. One thing I will say I don't approve of is all the comparisons between Allu and Maikelele's stats etc, they're both completely different style players and shouldn't be compared. Ultimately I don't think stats played any part between choosing between the two either.Anybody agree with my thoughts or do you think I'm completely off base?

There was one player who was in two of the games I was kicked from, I just noticed his name because I have played him before (there could have been more players across more than one game but i'm unsure), so getting booted is a possiblity, although it could just be coincidence given that there aren't that many Australian players these days.Was I being booted by guys who can't take getting beat, or are there possibly issues with the servers in Aus?

I just want the facts, without the poor humour and bad analysis from people who sound as if they have never watched football in their life.

2efkow	-31996	1408869947	BitcoinMining	Mining using a PC	Hey guys, so I am a complete noob at this, and I'm hoping for a simple explanation. I guess my question in a nutshell is whether using a PC to mine bitcoins as part of a pool is worthwhile. I see the term "cost-benefit analysis" thrown around a lot when talking about bitcoin, and I guess I am unsure whether this applies to mining in a pool, or people trying to use rigs to mine bitcoins in large quantities.I understand that my returns would be minimal, but can't establish whether the minimal returns would be offset by the cost of electricity usage. I would not be doing this to create vast sums of money, but simply to generate a bit of extra pocket money if that helps.

2r66re	-31996	1420257595	falcons	Discussion: Do we want to keep either co-ordinator?	I am really sick of fucking seeing seven guys drop back into the deepest zones ever seen on the face of this earth, and have some the stud offensive player on a team catch the ball with maybe one defender in screen. In my opinion, Mike Nolan has got to go. I know he had nothing to work with but time after time he called plays which let opposing teams off the hook, by letting our woeful front four go after a QB, while trying to stop a big play of 40+ yards. It is actually a sound theory, but when you give teams easy 15+ yard completions without their QB even getting touched, the theory goes right out the window.Dirk Koetter I am not 100% sold on either, but then again we all know the O-line has had injury after injury. He obviously has a tremendous track record with MJD, and has some really creative plays. I'd be happy to keep him, but would want to see improvement in the run game massively.Thoughts?
2txva6	-31996	1422428884	nfl	What does r/NFL want from the media?	This whole week I have seen a lot of people on here complain about the media's coverage of the Superbowl, the personalities in it, and, of course, the whole things with the Pats and the possibly deflated balls.What would you guys like to see from the media?Let me put an asterix on this. I am a journalist. However, I do not live in America, nor do I cover American Football. I work at a small country paper in Australia. I'm not trying to defend the media, or to back up the people who dislike the way they go about their business, I'm just trying to understand what it is people want to read about, both for my own reporting and also just my general inquisitiveness. Do you guys want less speculation? Less Marshawn Lynch? More Marshawn Lynch? Less features stories? More focus on what happens in a game?Personally, I reckon it would be awesome for journalists to just leave Marshawn Lynch alone, I know if he was on a team I covered, there is no way I'd even bother with him, he clearly dislikes/distrusts the media, so why bother talking to him to get one syllable answers? However, I will say in their defense, often times they are told by their editors to get a story on Marshawn Lynch, and well, like any job, you have to do what the boss says. As for deflategate, well some people think it has been inflated too much (pun absolutely intentional), and I honestly don't know what to think. It seems like some authority figures are treating it very seriously, while others think it is not a big deal (ie the Patriots, and what seems like a lot of other teams). I don't think you can blame the media for covering a story like this. People are clearly interested, there is new material every day, and it could have serious consequences.Please debate, and don't hate on me for being a journalist, I am a good guy I swear.

2v67i6	-31996	1423377900	statistics	Basic advice for data analysis	I am a journalist, about to go and mine the NAPLAN data for stories. I'd love some advice on how to go about it. I am not a statistician, although I do understand the basics. Essentially I will be compiling the results of school years in the coverage area of my organisation and then look at them to see what comes up. Basically what are some of the easy pitfalls I should try to avoid? What are things I should be looking for?
382004	-31996	1433143812	nfl	Spread offense blocking basics	Hey guys, I was hoping someone could give me a few quick principles of blocking in the spread offense. Basically how to block against six man fronts.I have followed and played football for a few years, but never really called an offense, something which I am about to do as a QB for a new team. I have the throwing mechanics set, I'm ok at best, and know what defenses look like and can recognise them at the line of scrimmage, but something which isn't coached very well over here is the blocking aspects on the O-line.Basically my football knowledge is mostly self-taught from forums like this and listening to colour commentators, so there are plenty of gaps in it.

3ca1je	-31996	1436167510	PS4	Xbox controller layout and match making questions	Hey guys, I've had n xbox and xbox 360 but I'm considering the switch to PS4 rather than get an Xbox One.My two hesitations are button layout and matchmaking.I don't like the PS controller at all, probably because I've spent the past decade using the Xbox layout. I know you can buy Xbox style controllers for PS but want to know whether they work.Also, how it match making on PS4? I remember it was horrible in PS3, and you would constantly be put in games with horrible lag, usually in the US (I'm in Australia). I think my net speed should be able to handle US games but would prefer to play in Australian ones for the better coonnection.Help me out?

I am basically self taught, I listen to a lot of BB King, Led Zeppelin and The Doors and have definitely been influenced by those artists, but I want to get better as a guitar player.Who are some good players to listen to, or some techniques that will help with my play style ie going through the pentatonic scale (but my advanced than that) bear in mind I don't read music

3iy3e8	-31996	1440934674	falcons	Has Kyle Shanahan allowed Matt Ryan to go out of shotgun a lot in the pre-season?	I haven't watched the Falcons all that closely in the pre-season (mostly because I live in Australia) but I did watch the start of the game today. I thought Ryan looked horrible doing all the drop backs, although that probably was mostly to do with Miami's D-line vs our O-line.Has Shanahan used Ryan much in the shotgun? If not, do you think that is just because it is pre-season and they don't want to give too much away, or a sign of things to come? I sincerely hope it is the former.

You see the links ever more increasingly on /r/atheism, and someone asked if vandalising the "You can be good without God" is a form of hate crime.However, are the people who express outrage at the atheist billboards the same people who laugh at things like this?http://www.thealmightyguru.com/Humor/Images/GodListensToSlayer.jpgIs this hypocritical?
bd2fq	-31998	1268522687	Art	Hey /r/art, a friend of mine is worrying about choosing art as a career. Is there any advice you guys can give? (please read the text)	She's at A-Level grade at the moment, looking at doing a foundation year before doing a Fine Art course. I think her main concern is finances - expensive courses plus her worrying about making money because she thinks she is terrible. Also, she seems to think that the teachers for the course were all miserable 'only here to pay the bills' types who took no joy in working with art, which only put her on more of a downer.Is there anything you can say, from experience, about a career in art? Are you able to live comfortably, or is the 'starving artist' stereotype widespread? Was doing art at university fun, or one of the most boring experiences imaginable? 
bgca6	-31998	1269215109	atheism	What does /r/atheism think about this (argument for a loose definition of 'god')?	Point one. Infinite many-worlds hypothesis states that anything that can conceiveably happen does so an infinite number of times simultaneously, and both has done and will do for eternity. It is conceivable that the necessary sub-atomic particles could arrange themselves at one point in time, barring for a moment the insanely large improbability (after all, even if improbable, it still may happen), into a super-sized quantum computer capable of consciousness. Since memory is but an arrangement of molecules in the brain, and knowledge is specific memory, it is also conceivable that part of this computer has knowledge of all possible realities and their goings on, past present and future. Not only is this possible, but occurs an infinite number of times simultaneously. From this - an omniscient being is possible.Point two. One of the arguments against time travel is the distinct lack of time travellers. Applying this to the theoretical omniscient being, it can be said that omnipotence (at least, inter-dimensional/inter-universe/very, very long distance travel/communication) is impossible. As the theoretical omniscient being occurs an infinite number of times, it is also possible that there is one that specifically knows and cares about our human race. Actually, not just one, an infinite number. If omnipotence (or anything else specifically mentioned) was logically possible, then any one of the infinite number of these beings would have done something, and would do so an infinite number of times simultaneously. Wow, those words are getting boring. Anyway.Conclusion. There is a God. There are an infinite number of Gods. They are very lonely and cannot do anything about it.
bzttd	-31998	1272969277	reddit.com	Dear reddit. Lord Mandelson will be at my college in about half an hour. What do you want me to ask?	As it says on the tin, really. Any takers?
c11q8	-31998	1273236338	ukpolitics	Is the Conservative opposition to a Hung Parliament an admittance of their own incompetence?	Their main statement is that nothing would get done, no-one would agree on anything, the country would be thrown into chaos etc. Is it just me, or is this an admittance that they would never compromise their own policies, despite what democracy, logic and the rest of the country say? Does it mean that they would pull a Republican and vote against every measure from any other political party that may come along?

chfi1	-31998	1277145900	AskReddit	What does reddit think of Al-Jazeera as a source for news?	As a Brit, most of the papers seem focused on the upcoming 'emergency budget' and that a released child killer has been found with child pornography, with seemingly no front page mention of the problems in Kyrgyzstan, the Russian shut down of Belarus' gas supply due to mounting debt, etc.I was wondering if anyone can give me a perspective on Al-Jazeera, a measure of trustworthiness, if you like.

Is there anything you guys can correct me on to help me comprehend this?
e9550	-31998	1290270373	AskReddit	Hey Reddit, I'm worried about my social circle's love of clubs and my lack of said love. What do?	Pretty much any time anyone has a form of celebration, people go to clubs (Liquid&amp;Envy/Reflex around my parts). I just can't stand them. It takes away what I love about meeting my friends (conversations, good laughs) and replaces it with everything I hate about music (thumping beats, dancing) and drinking for the sake of drinking. I've tried just getting absolutely plastered and trying to let loose, but it just doesn't work. Planning to go to Uni next year only makes me worry more, because isn't that pretty much the entirety of the social life there?I hate to impede on their good times in any way, but I also hate the feeling of being left out. Should I ditch the idea that I'm able to maintain the drinking level of friendships that were rampant in the house party days? Should I try and massively change my likes and dislikes? Should I just give up on the idea of socialising at University? What do?
fcpse	-31998	1296517708	Fitness	Hey dudes and dudettes, I've recently started up on the jogging in the getting started section, and was wondering what to do about the warm down?	I'm at Week 3 of http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml and using the 'balls of the feet' option, but this is killing my previously sofa/computer chair-bound calves - to the extent of severe stiffness and difficulty walking the next day, sometimes.What's an appropriate way to warm down the calves? I'm trying 'walking around the house on the balls of my feet for a while, reducing time doing this each time' and seeing where that gets me, but I'd rather check and make sure with people who actually know what they're doing(and yes, I'm trying to start other things - bodyweigh squats, sit-ups etc., I just can't afford gym access right now :P)

gpr84	-31998	1302767657	starcraft	Wouldn't it be better if NASL was casted from replays? (possible spoilers inside)	I understand the whole appeal of live games, really, but last night two games went down the drain because of scheduling/time zone conflicts. With replays the match could be organised so that each player could play it at least within the standard waking hours of their own timezone, then NASL would commentate later.They probably don't want another Clash Of The Titans thing going down, and that's understandable, people were pretty annoyed that those were casted from replays. But that was only because it was built up so much as this epic contest that looked as though it was going to be live. With replays there's no issues with lag, disconnect problems, timing problems etc.What does /r/starcraft think?
